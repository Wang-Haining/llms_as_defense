            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church has some problems. They are losing followers. This is because the Church is not very accepting of many things. They have strong views on things like marriage between two men or women, abortion, and birth control. These views are old-fashioned in some ways. If the Church changed its views, they might not lose followers.\n\nMany people are against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on some subjects. The Church says abortion is wrong, and if you think abortion is right, you may not want to be a part of the Church. The same is true for gay marriage. If you support gay marriage, you may not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nThe Church does not allow priests to be married or have women as priests. But this may not have stopped the Church's problems. It is hard to say what would have happened if priests could be married or if there were women priests.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God and are devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too. They can balance work and family life. Why can't priests?",
            "I am not opposed to marriage between people of the same sex. \n\nI think people are born gay. They do not make this choice. \n\nOthers and I do not think it is right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot. \n\nPeople are born gay. They do not have a choice. This is not a decision they made. \n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can get married. This is a personal issue. \n\nI do not think gay people should be punished. They should be free to be who they are. \n\nI believe the federal government should not be involved in this issue. It is not a matter of national security or morality. It is a personal issue. \n\nPeople should be free to live as they are. They should not be punished for being gay.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legal. Here is why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples are a threat to the heterosexual family. But this is not true. Gay couples are not the same as heterosexual couples. They have their own unique things.\n\nIt's like two different sides of the same coin. One side is heads, and the other side is tails. They are not the same.\n\nGay couples have the same civil rights as everyone else. They should be able to own property and get health care just like anyone else. If a gay person is sick, their partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is not just about being family, it's about love.\n\nMany studies show that gay couples are happy and successful just like any other couple. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship as everyone else.\n\nThe issue is not about getting married in a church. It's about getting a marriage certificate from the government. This is a legal document, not a church thing.\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. If the government gives gay couples a civil union, they should be allowed to marry.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and community issues. But this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They are the same as any other couple.\n\nThe main problem is how children are treated by other people in society. Gay couples should be treated the same as any other couple. They should be able to go to school and play with their friends like everyone else.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like anyone else. They can be involved in their community and be good neighbors.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The government should not make laws based on one person's moral views. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue. He thinks about this because of his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's religion. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are not normal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says this is not true. We should listen to scientists and experts, not just what our friends and neighbors think.\n\nIf we listen to the experts, we will see that gay people are just like everyone else. They are normal people who deserve to be treated with respect.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. A drug is not good or bad just because the law says so. I don't think we should make it available to the public. But we can use it to help people if a doctor says it is okay.\n\nMany medicines are not legal, but we use them because they are helpful. We use oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet to help patients. These are not available to just anyone. We use them because they are good for people. If we do not allow people to use marijuana because it is not legal, then that is not fair. Everyone should be able to use marijuana if it helps them.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. If you take too much marijuana, it can be bad for you. But if you drink too much alcohol, it can also be bad for you. We should not ban marijuana like we do with alcohol. We should make it legal, but people must use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea of marijuana because it is not allowed. But marijuana is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way we think about marijuana, people will use it responsibly. We can use it to help people who are sick.",
            "The church has changed over time. It is not as strict as it was before. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses and matching shoes. I also had a matching purse. This was what I wore every time I went to church. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on the weekends. We would go to church together. Now, things are different. The church now has a shorter service. It lasts only thirty minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families often come in late. The church is more casual now, even on Sundays. People wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change.\n\nThere are other things I notice about the church. This is the church I know. I do not understand the church's politics. I do not know why they make some decisions.\n\nSome people say the Catholic Church could have prevented problems with priests by allowing women to be priests or by allowing priests to get married. I do not think this would have helped. Some men are married and still have problems with children. Their choice to be a priest is not the reason for their problems. \n\nIn some religions, priests are allowed to get married. Some people become priests and still want to be married. If they want to practice their faith and be married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think the reasons for some priests' problems are based on their genes. I do not think people become this way because of how they are raised. It is their genes. We cannot change that with marriage. It may come out later. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about the problem and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea, but the September 11th attacks changed everything. Many people were in shock and the US went to war in Iraq for different reasons. The Bush administration connected the war to Osama Bin Laden and said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people and still has not admitted it. Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it at the UN. This is wrong and against the law. It is an impeachable offense to lie to the people.\n\nThe Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution and has tried to limit its power since 9/11. They wanted to go to war from the start. A former treasury secretary said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's feud with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to get more oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US withdraws now, there will be civil war and more deaths. But a new plan to have other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia help Iraq is not good. It will create more problems because Iraq's independence will be at risk.\n\nThe new Iraqi government is not working well. The parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A radical leader's party has a lot of power and there are still many groups fighting for control. This is causing problems in the political process.",
            "I did not know what to say. Let me think about it. \n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated problem. I do not know a lot about it. However, I think it started because of the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11. We went to war in Iraq because we thought they were involved. \n\nNow, I am not sure why we are staying there. I think it is because we want to build a democratic government in Iraq. We also want to get oil from them. But this is not a good reason to stay. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, we have to build a democracy. This will take time. It is not easy to build a new government. If we leave, people in Iraq will be unhappy with us. They will have to start again. \n\nI am confused about the war in Iraq. I do not know what to say. I think we should not call it a war anymore. It was not officially declared by Congress. I do not think it is a good reason to stay in Iraq.\n\nI do think it is good to help the people in Iraq. But it is also wasting our resources. I feel sorry for President Bush. The war is making him look bad. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared. That war is now known as a meaningless war.\n\nIt is hard to say what I think about the war in Iraq. There are many families with sons and daughters in the war. I want to help them, but I also think we are hurting the people in Iraq. We are making their lives harder. They have different customs and ways of life. If we stay, we will try to change them. This will make things worse for them.\n\nI think the war in Iraq will go on for a long time. It is a complicated problem. I do not know what to say.",
            "I do not think it is right for a state or government to make laws about what churches can or cannot do. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control the church. \n\nThe Constitution clearly says this. If the government tries to make laws about the church, it would go against what is already written. \n\nSome people are trying to make it illegal because most Catholics and Christians do not support it. But that is not right. The government should not decide what churches can or cannot do. It is up to the churches to decide.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows people to be free to believe what they want. The government did plan to make an amendment to the Constitution, but that would be wrong. It would go against what is already written.\n\nThe government should not be involved in this issue. The president is pushing for this amendment because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not right. The church should decide what it wants to do, not the government.\n\nThere is no good reason for an amendment to ban this. It will not help the economy. It might even help society in some way.\n\nI have said all I need to say.",
            "The war in Iraq was a serious problem. The American government did not tell the truth about why it started the war. They said it was because of the terrorist attacks on September 11th. However, that was not the real reason.\n\nMany people do not like war. I am one of them. I think it is never a good idea to start a war just to be safe. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq without a good reason.\n\nThis war was very similar to the Vietnam War. The US government wanted to remove the government of Iraq and make a new one. But they did not think about what would happen after the war. Many American soldiers died in the war. It was a sad and tragic thing.\n\nThe US government said it would be easy to make Iraq a democracy. But it was not that easy. It takes a long time to build a new government. The US government did not think about this before the war. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nThe war in Iraq is difficult to end. If we start a war, we must think about what will happen after. We must be prepared for all possible outcomes. The US government was not prepared for the problems in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers are still in Iraq and many are dying. The US government is trying to teach the Iraqi people how to govern themselves. But it is a long and hard process. I think the US government made a mistake by going to war. They did not tell the truth about their reasons. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this. If we go to war, we must finish what we start. But we must also think about the cost. Many American soldiers have died in the war. Is it worth it? I am not sure.\n\nOne of the reasons we went to war with Iraq was to get their oil. Oil is a very important resource. I think the US government was not honest about its reasons for the war. They said it was to make Iraq a democracy, but that was not true.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon and there will be peace. But I do not think it will be easy.",
            "I am for gay marriage.  I have always been.  I believe it is a personal preference and not something that people should be judged for.  Many studies have shown that being gay is not chosen, but rather something that people are born with.\n\nI do not think that government should decide who can and cannot get married.  Marriage is a personal choice between two people, not something that should be controlled by the state.  In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live normal lives and contribute to our community just like anyone else.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to limit gay marriage is wrong.  Marriage is not something that he or anyone else should be able to decide.  I believe it is ridiculous for him to try to control what is a personal choice.\n\nMany studies have shown that being gay is not a choice, but rather something that people are born with.  It is not something that people can change, and it is not something that they should be ashamed of.  I believe that people should be free to make their own choices about who they love and who they want to marry.\n\nMarriage is a personal choice between two people, and it should not be controlled by the government.  If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without anyone knowing.  But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a different story.\n\nI believe that gay marriage should be a personal choice and not something that is decided by the government.  It is a private matter that should not be made public.",
            "You cannot put something on the internet that is not true. The internet is a public place. Anything you put there is seen by many people. When you are friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you can see their messages. But this does not mean that the school can look at your private messages. The school can only act on something if someone tells them about it. They cannot ignore it or do nothing.\n\nIt can be hard to know what to believe. Some people only joke around on the internet. It could be like a school project that went wrong. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nSomething like this happened at our school. Someone overheard a student saying something and told the school. We found out it was not true, but it was on the student's Facebook page. The school got worried because it looked like he meant it. When you put something on the internet, you have no control over who sees it. If you don't want people to know something, don't put it on the internet.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their pages or messages. If a student's friend tells the school something, it's not an invasion of privacy. The school has to act on it if there is danger. They should not listen to phone calls or texts without a good reason.\n\nA teacher should not make a secret account on the internet to be friends with students. This is not right. It's not fair to the students. The teacher should not know things about them that they don't want to share.",
            "I think the war has gone too long. \n\nThe purpose of the war was good at first. We wanted to bring democracy to a country that did not have a fair government. But now, it seems like the main reason for the war is just to show that we are a powerful country.\n\nI also think the original reasons for the war were not clear. We were influenced by past events, like problems between the United States and Iraq. If we were fighting for democracy, it would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons involved, it would not be good.\n\nI believe we made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a strong statement. But the war has gone on for many years. This is too long.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, it would be a good reason for war. But I think our reason has changed over time. We are now fighting just to fight.\n\nThe war has gone on too long. The country we are fighting will have to take care of itself soon. We are spending a lot of money on the war. This money could be used to solve problems in our own country, like poverty and poor public services.\n\nWe should stop the war. We have our own problems to solve. We should use our money to make our country better, not to fight a war that we no longer believe in.\n\nWe are spending too much money on the war. War should not be in our long-term budget. We have many problems in our country that need our attention, like health care and education.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question about something. It is true that people can see information on the internet. This is because when you put something online, it can be seen by many people. If you have a profile on a website, you allow others to see it when you add them as friends. \n\nHowever, it is difficult to have someone watch all students in school to prevent bad things. This could be unfair to some students. It is also not right to look at everyone's profiles just to find something wrong with them.\n\nPeople are worried about strangers seeing their personal information online. For example, someone on TV showed how easy it is to get information about someone on the internet. He found a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. You can also put pictures, class schedules, and other information on the internet. It can be hard to decide how much to share because you want to keep in touch with your friends.\n\nYou can limit what you put online, but you never know who can see it. My friend's high school did not allow students to have Myspace accounts. This made me wonder if the school had the right to tell students what to do online.",
            "I am a little confused. We have a lot to talk about, including the Iraq War. I do not want to be part of the group of people who always say they were against the war from the start. But, I was against it. However, it does not matter much now. Most people agree that the war was not a good idea. In fact, almost eighty percent of people around the world think this way. Even many U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq think the war was a bad idea and we should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was bad before we arrived. It was a disaster. Now, leaving is also a difficult problem. There is a big difference in culture between the United States and countries in the Middle East. This makes it hard for us to understand each other. We must respect how other people want to live their lives.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading Iraq. We must weigh the good and bad results of our actions. The war has been a disaster, like quicksand that pulls us down.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may think there are good reasons to stay, but I do not agree. I do not see a reason why we should not leave now. Many Iraqis think the same way. They say we should leave within a year. We are trying to help them, but they are telling us to leave.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, we cannot blame them if things go badly. If we decide to help them later, we will at least be seen as trying to do the right thing. Maybe we will never be seen as good guys in the Middle East, but it will be better than where we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem called gender bias in the United States. It is not just about men and women. The kind of work you do also makes a difference. \n\nFor women, it can be harder to succeed because of a thing called the glass ceiling. Even though there should be equality, it is hard for women to find jobs where they can be in charge. This is because of the way society has been for a long time. In the past, men have been in charge. \n\nIn many workplaces, women may have the qualifications for a job, but they may not get it because of their gender. It is the same for men in some industries, like fashion. \n\nSometimes, people do not take men seriously if they are into fashion. They may think that men who like fashion are not normal. \n\nThe same thing happens with men who stay at home to raise their children. Society does not expect men to do this, and it can be hard for them. \n\nBut things are changing. More and more women are getting important jobs, and people are starting to accept this. Men who stay at home are also becoming more accepted. \n\nWe need to promote people who are different and show their good qualities. If we do this in a gentle way, people will accept it. We have made a lot of progress, and change takes time. \n\nWe also have a problem with people from different places being judged. If someone from a farm has poor grammar but is very smart, they may have trouble getting ahead because of where they come from. \n\nThis is another example of discrimination. It can be between men and women, or it can be between people from different places. \n\nI do not know what the solution is, but we need to keep working on it.",
            "I think they made marijuana a less serious crime. They changed it from a crime that gets you arrested to a ticket you get for something like a traffic ticket. This means that you don't have to be arrested and taken to jail. But, even if it's no longer a serious crime, some people worry about the future problems it can cause. These problems can affect things like job interviews and other important situations.\n\nSome people think it costs a lot to arrest people, take them to court, and pay for their lawyers. This is true, especially for small cities that don't have much money. That's why some cities don't want to make marijuana a less serious crime, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in some cities, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it's okay to make marijuana less serious. This means the city can use the money it saves to help people, like children, the elderly, and those who are homeless.\n\nI think it's a good idea to make marijuana less serious. It's not something that should be everywhere, and there are good reasons for that. Also, making it less serious can save money for cities.\n\nOne problem with making it totally legal is that people might smoke it and drive cars. This is not safe. Also, in some places, smoking marijuana is still not accepted. If it's out in the open, it might be uncomfortable for some people.\n\nAlcohol can be more dangerous than marijuana because it affects your driving skills. But marijuana can still have bad effects on people's lifestyles. How people react to substances is different. Some people are careful and don't have problems, while others do.\n\nIt's hard to say how marijuana affects people because everyone reacts differently. But I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. Here's why:\n\nThe Catholic Church has many old customs that have been done for a long time. Some are good, but it is also important to change when necessary. Many Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules perfectly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people from other religions. For example, my parents' religions were different. They could not get married in the Catholic Church because my father was not Catholic.\n\nI do not think this is fair. We are taught to love others, which is a basic Catholic rule. It is hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them. I think the Catholic Church's teachings and its practices do not match.\n\nI do not think my own opinion on this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could get married, but it would not stop them from behaving badly. Some people would harm children, even if they were married. This is because they are harming children, not because they are single or married.\n\nThe Church should be fair and accept people from all religions. They should also be careful with the people they choose to be priests. This is because priests have a lot of power and influence.",
            "This is a very difficult subject. I am not sure what to think. Two things are very important here: government and church rules. One is about marriage and how it is defined. It is hard to decide on this issue without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a very special thing. It is between two people. But it is also a union of two people. It is like a partnership. The government should not decide what kind of marriage it is. This is because the government and church are separate.\n\nIf two people get married, they should be treated the same. They should not be looked at differently because of their marriage. They should get the same rights and taxes.\n\nThe question of gay marriage is also important. Two people love each other, and they want to be together. They should be able to get married and be treated the same as other couples.\n\nIf many states agree on this issue, it should be made into a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution. We should not make a big deal out of it.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends, and this makes me think carefully about the subject. I do not agree with the idea, but I believe it should be legal. I do not think it's a national issue. Instead, I think each state should make its own decision.\n\nIf a state is democratic, it will probably support gay marriage. If you live in that state, you will know how it feels about this issue. I don't think you should disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect its choice.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI already answered this question. This is my opinion.\n\nI don't think President Bush should decide for the whole country what to do about gay marriage. I believe each state should decide for itself. I disagree with his decision to ban gay marriage.\n\nI just think that the president should not make decisions for every state. He does not live in every state, so he cannot know what is best for each one. Some things should be left up to each individual state.\n\nThe president will not be in office for much longer. If a new president decides to change the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. I think each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the choice, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have the answer to that question.",
            "I do not think school officials are wrong to look at student posts on Myspace. When you put something on the internet, it is like posting it in a public place. Everyone can see it, including school officials. They can find it even if it is not under the school's name.\n\nIf school officials look at Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think it is okay. Keeping students safe is the school's job. They should do what they can to make the school a safe place.\n\nSome school officials look at Myspace to see if students are doing things they should not be doing. They go on the internet to catch students who are breaking the rules. I think this is not right. It is an invasion of privacy. But if it helps make the school safer, I think it is okay.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself more when you are writing than when you are talking. When you post something on Myspace, you should think about what could happen. Once something is on the internet, it is always there. It can hurt you in the future.\n\nIf you do something bad when you are a student, it can come back and hurt you when you are older and important. You should think about this before you post something on the internet.\n\nI do not think school officials should go on Myspace just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to look, like to make the school safer, it is okay. Parents trust the school to be a safe place for their children. I think school officials are just trying to do their job.\n\nWhen I went to school, we had drills to prepare for a school shooting. We practiced what to do if someone came into the building. The school officials were trying to keep us safe. I think they are doing the same thing now by looking at Myspace.\n\nThey were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were just doing their job to keep the school a safe place.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. I was affected by the September 11 attacks. I wanted to help. I thought we should go to another country and show them what we can do. But I now think we made a mistake.\n\nWe went to war without a good plan. We were angry and wanted revenge. I think we should have thought about the long-term effects. We didn't consider the people we were helping. They were busy fighting with each other.\n\nI don't think it's our job to help them. If they can't work together, we can't make a difference. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think the people there are fighting for themselves, not for a better country.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are not interested in improving their country; they want us to leave. I think we should do that. We went to war on impulse, without thinking. We were looking for revenge, not a solution.\n\nThe president wanted to go to war because the people wanted it. But he should have had a better plan. He should have thought about what we would do there. We didn't have a clear goal. We didn't work together. We just went to war.\n\nI don't think we can change them. They are the way they are. We can't stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We should not be there.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. We didn't think about what would happen. We were too angry. I don't think we should be in that country anymore."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church has some problems. They are losing followers. This is because the Church is not very accepting of many things. They have strong views on things like marriage between two men or women, abortion, and birth control. These views are old-fashioned in some ways. If the Church changed its views, they might not lose followers.\n\nMany people are against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on some subjects. The Church says abortion is wrong, and if you think abortion is right, you may not want to be a part of the Church. The same is true for gay marriage. If you support gay marriage, you may not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nThe Church does not allow priests to be married or have women as priests. But this may not have stopped the Church's problems. It is hard to say what would have happened if priests could be married or if there were women priests.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God and are devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too. They can balance work and family life. Why can't priests?",
            "I am not opposed to marriage between people of the same sex. \n\nI think people are born gay. They do not make this choice. \n\nOthers and I do not think it is right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot. \n\nPeople are born gay. They do not have a choice. This is not a decision they made. \n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can get married. This is a personal issue. \n\nI do not think gay people should be punished. They should be free to be who they are. \n\nI believe the federal government should not be involved in this issue. It is not a matter of national security or morality. It is a personal issue. \n\nPeople should be free to live as they are. They should not be punished for being gay.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legal. Here is why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples are a threat to the heterosexual family. But this is not true. Gay couples are not the same as heterosexual couples. They have their own unique things.\n\nIt's like two different sides of the same coin. One side is heads, and the other side is tails. They are not the same.\n\nGay couples have the same civil rights as everyone else. They should be able to own property and get health care just like anyone else. If a gay person is sick, their partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is not just about being family, it's about love.\n\nMany studies show that gay couples are happy and successful just like any other couple. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship as everyone else.\n\nThe issue is not about getting married in a church. It's about getting a marriage certificate from the government. This is a legal document, not a church thing.\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. If the government gives gay couples a civil union, they should be allowed to marry.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and community issues. But this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They are the same as any other couple.\n\nThe main problem is how children are treated by other people in society. Gay couples should be treated the same as any other couple. They should be able to go to school and play with their friends like everyone else.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like anyone else. They can be involved in their community and be good neighbors.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The government should not make laws based on one person's moral views. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue. He thinks about this because of his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's religion. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are not normal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says this is not true. We should listen to scientists and experts, not just what our friends and neighbors think.\n\nIf we listen to the experts, we will see that gay people are just like everyone else. They are normal people who deserve to be treated with respect.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. A drug is not good or bad just because the law says so. I don't think we should make it available to the public. But we can use it to help people if a doctor says it is okay.\n\nMany medicines are not legal, but we use them because they are helpful. We use oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet to help patients. These are not available to just anyone. We use them because they are good for people. If we do not allow people to use marijuana because it is not legal, then that is not fair. Everyone should be able to use marijuana if it helps them.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. If you take too much marijuana, it can be bad for you. But if you drink too much alcohol, it can also be bad for you. We should not ban marijuana like we do with alcohol. We should make it legal, but people must use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea of marijuana because it is not allowed. But marijuana is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way we think about marijuana, people will use it responsibly. We can use it to help people who are sick.",
            "The church has changed over time. It is not as strict as it was before. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses and matching shoes. I also had a matching purse. This was what I wore every time I went to church. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on the weekends. We would go to church together. Now, things are different. The church now has a shorter service. It lasts only thirty minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families often come in late. The church is more casual now, even on Sundays. People wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change.\n\nThere are other things I notice about the church. This is the church I know. I do not understand the church's politics. I do not know why they make some decisions.\n\nSome people say the Catholic Church could have prevented problems with priests by allowing women to be priests or by allowing priests to get married. I do not think this would have helped. Some men are married and still have problems with children. Their choice to be a priest is not the reason for their problems. \n\nIn some religions, priests are allowed to get married. Some people become priests and still want to be married. If they want to practice their faith and be married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think the reasons for some priests' problems are based on their genes. I do not think people become this way because of how they are raised. It is their genes. We cannot change that with marriage. It may come out later. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about the problem and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea, but the September 11th attacks changed everything. Many people were in shock and the US went to war in Iraq for different reasons. The Bush administration connected the war to Osama Bin Laden and said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people and still has not admitted it. Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it at the UN. This is wrong and against the law. It is an impeachable offense to lie to the people.\n\nThe Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution and has tried to limit its power since 9/11. They wanted to go to war from the start. A former treasury secretary said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's feud with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to get more oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US withdraws now, there will be civil war and more deaths. But a new plan to have other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia help Iraq is not good. It will create more problems because Iraq's independence will be at risk.\n\nThe new Iraqi government is not working well. The parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A radical leader's party has a lot of power and there are still many groups fighting for control. This is causing problems in the political process.",
            "I did not know what to say. Let me think about it. \n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated problem. I do not know a lot about it. However, I think it started because of the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11. We went to war in Iraq because we thought they were involved. \n\nNow, I am not sure why we are staying there. I think it is because we want to build a democratic government in Iraq. We also want to get oil from them. But this is not a good reason to stay. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, we have to build a democracy. This will take time. It is not easy to build a new government. If we leave, people in Iraq will be unhappy with us. They will have to start again. \n\nI am confused about the war in Iraq. I do not know what to say. I think we should not call it a war anymore. It was not officially declared by Congress. I do not think it is a good reason to stay in Iraq.\n\nI do think it is good to help the people in Iraq. But it is also wasting our resources. I feel sorry for President Bush. The war is making him look bad. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared. That war is now known as a meaningless war.\n\nIt is hard to say what I think about the war in Iraq. There are many families with sons and daughters in the war. I want to help them, but I also think we are hurting the people in Iraq. We are making their lives harder. They have different customs and ways of life. If we stay, we will try to change them. This will make things worse for them.\n\nI think the war in Iraq will go on for a long time. It is a complicated problem. I do not know what to say.",
            "I do not think it is right for a state or government to make laws about what churches can or cannot do. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control the church. \n\nThe Constitution clearly says this. If the government tries to make laws about the church, it would go against what is already written. \n\nSome people are trying to make it illegal because most Catholics and Christians do not support it. But that is not right. The government should not decide what churches can or cannot do. It is up to the churches to decide.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows people to be free to believe what they want. The government did plan to make an amendment to the Constitution, but that would be wrong. It would go against what is already written.\n\nThe government should not be involved in this issue. The president is pushing for this amendment because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not right. The church should decide what it wants to do, not the government.\n\nThere is no good reason for an amendment to ban this. It will not help the economy. It might even help society in some way.\n\nI have said all I need to say.",
            "The war in Iraq was a serious problem. The American government did not tell the truth about why it started the war. They said it was because of the terrorist attacks on September 11th. However, that was not the real reason.\n\nMany people do not like war. I am one of them. I think it is never a good idea to start a war just to be safe. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq without a good reason.\n\nThis war was very similar to the Vietnam War. The US government wanted to remove the government of Iraq and make a new one. But they did not think about what would happen after the war. Many American soldiers died in the war. It was a sad and tragic thing.\n\nThe US government said it would be easy to make Iraq a democracy. But it was not that easy. It takes a long time to build a new government. The US government did not think about this before the war. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nThe war in Iraq is difficult to end. If we start a war, we must think about what will happen after. We must be prepared for all possible outcomes. The US government was not prepared for the problems in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers are still in Iraq and many are dying. The US government is trying to teach the Iraqi people how to govern themselves. But it is a long and hard process. I think the US government made a mistake by going to war. They did not tell the truth about their reasons. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this. If we go to war, we must finish what we start. But we must also think about the cost. Many American soldiers have died in the war. Is it worth it? I am not sure.\n\nOne of the reasons we went to war with Iraq was to get their oil. Oil is a very important resource. I think the US government was not honest about its reasons for the war. They said it was to make Iraq a democracy, but that was not true.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon and there will be peace. But I do not think it will be easy.",
            "I am for gay marriage.  I have always been.  I believe it is a personal preference and not something that people should be judged for.  Many studies have shown that being gay is not chosen, but rather something that people are born with.\n\nI do not think that government should decide who can and cannot get married.  Marriage is a personal choice between two people, not something that should be controlled by the state.  In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live normal lives and contribute to our community just like anyone else.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to limit gay marriage is wrong.  Marriage is not something that he or anyone else should be able to decide.  I believe it is ridiculous for him to try to control what is a personal choice.\n\nMany studies have shown that being gay is not a choice, but rather something that people are born with.  It is not something that people can change, and it is not something that they should be ashamed of.  I believe that people should be free to make their own choices about who they love and who they want to marry.\n\nMarriage is a personal choice between two people, and it should not be controlled by the government.  If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without anyone knowing.  But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a different story.\n\nI believe that gay marriage should be a personal choice and not something that is decided by the government.  It is a private matter that should not be made public.",
            "You cannot put something on the internet that is not true. The internet is a public place. Anything you put there is seen by many people. When you are friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you can see their messages. But this does not mean that the school can look at your private messages. The school can only act on something if someone tells them about it. They cannot ignore it or do nothing.\n\nIt can be hard to know what to believe. Some people only joke around on the internet. It could be like a school project that went wrong. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nSomething like this happened at our school. Someone overheard a student saying something and told the school. We found out it was not true, but it was on the student's Facebook page. The school got worried because it looked like he meant it. When you put something on the internet, you have no control over who sees it. If you don't want people to know something, don't put it on the internet.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their pages or messages. If a student's friend tells the school something, it's not an invasion of privacy. The school has to act on it if there is danger. They should not listen to phone calls or texts without a good reason.\n\nA teacher should not make a secret account on the internet to be friends with students. This is not right. It's not fair to the students. The teacher should not know things about them that they don't want to share.",
            "I think the war has gone too long. \n\nThe purpose of the war was good at first. We wanted to bring democracy to a country that did not have a fair government. But now, it seems like the main reason for the war is just to show that we are a powerful country.\n\nI also think the original reasons for the war were not clear. We were influenced by past events, like problems between the United States and Iraq. If we were fighting for democracy, it would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons involved, it would not be good.\n\nI believe we made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a strong statement. But the war has gone on for many years. This is too long.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, it would be a good reason for war. But I think our reason has changed over time. We are now fighting just to fight.\n\nThe war has gone on too long. The country we are fighting will have to take care of itself soon. We are spending a lot of money on the war. This money could be used to solve problems in our own country, like poverty and poor public services.\n\nWe should stop the war. We have our own problems to solve. We should use our money to make our country better, not to fight a war that we no longer believe in.\n\nWe are spending too much money on the war. War should not be in our long-term budget. We have many problems in our country that need our attention, like health care and education.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question about something. It is true that people can see information on the internet. This is because when you put something online, it can be seen by many people. If you have a profile on a website, you allow others to see it when you add them as friends. \n\nHowever, it is difficult to have someone watch all students in school to prevent bad things. This could be unfair to some students. It is also not right to look at everyone's profiles just to find something wrong with them.\n\nPeople are worried about strangers seeing their personal information online. For example, someone on TV showed how easy it is to get information about someone on the internet. He found a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. You can also put pictures, class schedules, and other information on the internet. It can be hard to decide how much to share because you want to keep in touch with your friends.\n\nYou can limit what you put online, but you never know who can see it. My friend's high school did not allow students to have Myspace accounts. This made me wonder if the school had the right to tell students what to do online.",
            "I am a little confused. We have a lot to talk about, including the Iraq War. I do not want to be part of the group of people who always say they were against the war from the start. But, I was against it. However, it does not matter much now. Most people agree that the war was not a good idea. In fact, almost eighty percent of people around the world think this way. Even many U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq think the war was a bad idea and we should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was bad before we arrived. It was a disaster. Now, leaving is also a difficult problem. There is a big difference in culture between the United States and countries in the Middle East. This makes it hard for us to understand each other. We must respect how other people want to live their lives.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading Iraq. We must weigh the good and bad results of our actions. The war has been a disaster, like quicksand that pulls us down.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may think there are good reasons to stay, but I do not agree. I do not see a reason why we should not leave now. Many Iraqis think the same way. They say we should leave within a year. We are trying to help them, but they are telling us to leave.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, we cannot blame them if things go badly. If we decide to help them later, we will at least be seen as trying to do the right thing. Maybe we will never be seen as good guys in the Middle East, but it will be better than where we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem called gender bias in the United States. It is not just about men and women. The kind of work you do also makes a difference. \n\nFor women, it can be harder to succeed because of a thing called the glass ceiling. Even though there should be equality, it is hard for women to find jobs where they can be in charge. This is because of the way society has been for a long time. In the past, men have been in charge. \n\nIn many workplaces, women may have the qualifications for a job, but they may not get it because of their gender. It is the same for men in some industries, like fashion. \n\nSometimes, people do not take men seriously if they are into fashion. They may think that men who like fashion are not normal. \n\nThe same thing happens with men who stay at home to raise their children. Society does not expect men to do this, and it can be hard for them. \n\nBut things are changing. More and more women are getting important jobs, and people are starting to accept this. Men who stay at home are also becoming more accepted. \n\nWe need to promote people who are different and show their good qualities. If we do this in a gentle way, people will accept it. We have made a lot of progress, and change takes time. \n\nWe also have a problem with people from different places being judged. If someone from a farm has poor grammar but is very smart, they may have trouble getting ahead because of where they come from. \n\nThis is another example of discrimination. It can be between men and women, or it can be between people from different places. \n\nI do not know what the solution is, but we need to keep working on it.",
            "I think they made marijuana a less serious crime. They changed it from a crime that gets you arrested to a ticket you get for something like a traffic ticket. This means that you don't have to be arrested and taken to jail. But, even if it's no longer a serious crime, some people worry about the future problems it can cause. These problems can affect things like job interviews and other important situations.\n\nSome people think it costs a lot to arrest people, take them to court, and pay for their lawyers. This is true, especially for small cities that don't have much money. That's why some cities don't want to make marijuana a less serious crime, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in some cities, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it's okay to make marijuana less serious. This means the city can use the money it saves to help people, like children, the elderly, and those who are homeless.\n\nI think it's a good idea to make marijuana less serious. It's not something that should be everywhere, and there are good reasons for that. Also, making it less serious can save money for cities.\n\nOne problem with making it totally legal is that people might smoke it and drive cars. This is not safe. Also, in some places, smoking marijuana is still not accepted. If it's out in the open, it might be uncomfortable for some people.\n\nAlcohol can be more dangerous than marijuana because it affects your driving skills. But marijuana can still have bad effects on people's lifestyles. How people react to substances is different. Some people are careful and don't have problems, while others do.\n\nIt's hard to say how marijuana affects people because everyone reacts differently. But I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. Here's why:\n\nThe Catholic Church has many old customs that have been done for a long time. Some are good, but it is also important to change when necessary. Many Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules perfectly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people from other religions. For example, my parents' religions were different. They could not get married in the Catholic Church because my father was not Catholic.\n\nI do not think this is fair. We are taught to love others, which is a basic Catholic rule. It is hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them. I think the Catholic Church's teachings and its practices do not match.\n\nI do not think my own opinion on this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could get married, but it would not stop them from behaving badly. Some people would harm children, even if they were married. This is because they are harming children, not because they are single or married.\n\nThe Church should be fair and accept people from all religions. They should also be careful with the people they choose to be priests. This is because priests have a lot of power and influence.",
            "This is a very difficult subject. I am not sure what to think. Two things are very important here: government and church rules. One is about marriage and how it is defined. It is hard to decide on this issue without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a very special thing. It is between two people. But it is also a union of two people. It is like a partnership. The government should not decide what kind of marriage it is. This is because the government and church are separate.\n\nIf two people get married, they should be treated the same. They should not be looked at differently because of their marriage. They should get the same rights and taxes.\n\nThe question of gay marriage is also important. Two people love each other, and they want to be together. They should be able to get married and be treated the same as other couples.\n\nIf many states agree on this issue, it should be made into a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution. We should not make a big deal out of it.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends, and this makes me think carefully about the subject. I do not agree with the idea, but I believe it should be legal. I do not think it's a national issue. Instead, I think each state should make its own decision.\n\nIf a state is democratic, it will probably support gay marriage. If you live in that state, you will know how it feels about this issue. I don't think you should disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect its choice.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI already answered this question. This is my opinion.\n\nI don't think President Bush should decide for the whole country what to do about gay marriage. I believe each state should decide for itself. I disagree with his decision to ban gay marriage.\n\nI just think that the president should not make decisions for every state. He does not live in every state, so he cannot know what is best for each one. Some things should be left up to each individual state.\n\nThe president will not be in office for much longer. If a new president decides to change the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. I think each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the choice, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have the answer to that question.",
            "I do not think school officials are wrong to look at student posts on Myspace. When you put something on the internet, it is like posting it in a public place. Everyone can see it, including school officials. They can find it even if it is not under the school's name.\n\nIf school officials look at Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think it is okay. Keeping students safe is the school's job. They should do what they can to make the school a safe place.\n\nSome school officials look at Myspace to see if students are doing things they should not be doing. They go on the internet to catch students who are breaking the rules. I think this is not right. It is an invasion of privacy. But if it helps make the school safer, I think it is okay.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself more when you are writing than when you are talking. When you post something on Myspace, you should think about what could happen. Once something is on the internet, it is always there. It can hurt you in the future.\n\nIf you do something bad when you are a student, it can come back and hurt you when you are older and important. You should think about this before you post something on the internet.\n\nI do not think school officials should go on Myspace just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to look, like to make the school safer, it is okay. Parents trust the school to be a safe place for their children. I think school officials are just trying to do their job.\n\nWhen I went to school, we had drills to prepare for a school shooting. We practiced what to do if someone came into the building. The school officials were trying to keep us safe. I think they are doing the same thing now by looking at Myspace.\n\nThey were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were just doing their job to keep the school a safe place.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. I was affected by the September 11 attacks. I wanted to help. I thought we should go to another country and show them what we can do. But I now think we made a mistake.\n\nWe went to war without a good plan. We were angry and wanted revenge. I think we should have thought about the long-term effects. We didn't consider the people we were helping. They were busy fighting with each other.\n\nI don't think it's our job to help them. If they can't work together, we can't make a difference. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think the people there are fighting for themselves, not for a better country.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are not interested in improving their country; they want us to leave. I think we should do that. We went to war on impulse, without thinking. We were looking for revenge, not a solution.\n\nThe president wanted to go to war because the people wanted it. But he should have had a better plan. He should have thought about what we would do there. We didn't have a clear goal. We didn't work together. We just went to war.\n\nI don't think we can change them. They are the way they are. We can't stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We should not be there.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. We didn't think about what would happen. We were too angry. I don't think we should be in that country anymore."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church has some problems. They are losing followers. This is because the Church is not very accepting of many things. They have strong views on things like marriage between two men or women, abortion, and birth control. These views are old-fashioned in some ways. If the Church changed its views, they might not lose followers.\n\nMany people are against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on some subjects. The Church says abortion is wrong, and if you think abortion is right, you may not want to be a part of the Church. The same is true for gay marriage. If you support gay marriage, you may not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nThe Church does not allow priests to be married or have women as priests. But this may not have stopped the Church's problems. It is hard to say what would have happened if priests could be married or if there were women priests.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God and are devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too. They can balance work and family life. Why can't priests?",
            "I am not opposed to marriage between people of the same sex. \n\nI think people are born gay. They do not make this choice. \n\nOthers and I do not think it is right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot. \n\nPeople are born gay. They do not have a choice. This is not a decision they made. \n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can get married. This is a personal issue. \n\nI do not think gay people should be punished. They should be free to be who they are. \n\nI believe the federal government should not be involved in this issue. It is not a matter of national security or morality. It is a personal issue. \n\nPeople should be free to live as they are. They should not be punished for being gay.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legal. Here is why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples are a threat to the heterosexual family. But this is not true. Gay couples are not the same as heterosexual couples. They have their own unique things.\n\nIt's like two different sides of the same coin. One side is heads, and the other side is tails. They are not the same.\n\nGay couples have the same civil rights as everyone else. They should be able to own property and get health care just like anyone else. If a gay person is sick, their partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is not just about being family, it's about love.\n\nMany studies show that gay couples are happy and successful just like any other couple. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship as everyone else.\n\nThe issue is not about getting married in a church. It's about getting a marriage certificate from the government. This is a legal document, not a church thing.\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. If the government gives gay couples a civil union, they should be allowed to marry.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and community issues. But this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They are the same as any other couple.\n\nThe main problem is how children are treated by other people in society. Gay couples should be treated the same as any other couple. They should be able to go to school and play with their friends like everyone else.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like anyone else. They can be involved in their community and be good neighbors.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The government should not make laws based on one person's moral views. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue. He thinks about this because of his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's religion. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are not normal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says this is not true. We should listen to scientists and experts, not just what our friends and neighbors think.\n\nIf we listen to the experts, we will see that gay people are just like everyone else. They are normal people who deserve to be treated with respect.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. A drug is not good or bad just because the law says so. I don't think we should make it available to the public. But we can use it to help people if a doctor says it is okay.\n\nMany medicines are not legal, but we use them because they are helpful. We use oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet to help patients. These are not available to just anyone. We use them because they are good for people. If we do not allow people to use marijuana because it is not legal, then that is not fair. Everyone should be able to use marijuana if it helps them.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. If you take too much marijuana, it can be bad for you. But if you drink too much alcohol, it can also be bad for you. We should not ban marijuana like we do with alcohol. We should make it legal, but people must use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea of marijuana because it is not allowed. But marijuana is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way we think about marijuana, people will use it responsibly. We can use it to help people who are sick.",
            "The church has changed over time. It is not as strict as it was before. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses and matching shoes. I also had a matching purse. This was what I wore every time I went to church. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on the weekends. We would go to church together. Now, things are different. The church now has a shorter service. It lasts only thirty minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families often come in late. The church is more casual now, even on Sundays. People wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change.\n\nThere are other things I notice about the church. This is the church I know. I do not understand the church's politics. I do not know why they make some decisions.\n\nSome people say the Catholic Church could have prevented problems with priests by allowing women to be priests or by allowing priests to get married. I do not think this would have helped. Some men are married and still have problems with children. Their choice to be a priest is not the reason for their problems. \n\nIn some religions, priests are allowed to get married. Some people become priests and still want to be married. If they want to practice their faith and be married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think the reasons for some priests' problems are based on their genes. I do not think people become this way because of how they are raised. It is their genes. We cannot change that with marriage. It may come out later. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about the problem and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea, but the September 11th attacks changed everything. Many people were in shock and the US went to war in Iraq for different reasons. The Bush administration connected the war to Osama Bin Laden and said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people and still has not admitted it. Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it at the UN. This is wrong and against the law. It is an impeachable offense to lie to the people.\n\nThe Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution and has tried to limit its power since 9/11. They wanted to go to war from the start. A former treasury secretary said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's feud with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to get more oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US withdraws now, there will be civil war and more deaths. But a new plan to have other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia help Iraq is not good. It will create more problems because Iraq's independence will be at risk.\n\nThe new Iraqi government is not working well. The parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A radical leader's party has a lot of power and there are still many groups fighting for control. This is causing problems in the political process.",
            "I did not know what to say. Let me think about it. \n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated problem. I do not know a lot about it. However, I think it started because of the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11. We went to war in Iraq because we thought they were involved. \n\nNow, I am not sure why we are staying there. I think it is because we want to build a democratic government in Iraq. We also want to get oil from them. But this is not a good reason to stay. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, we have to build a democracy. This will take time. It is not easy to build a new government. If we leave, people in Iraq will be unhappy with us. They will have to start again. \n\nI am confused about the war in Iraq. I do not know what to say. I think we should not call it a war anymore. It was not officially declared by Congress. I do not think it is a good reason to stay in Iraq.\n\nI do think it is good to help the people in Iraq. But it is also wasting our resources. I feel sorry for President Bush. The war is making him look bad. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared. That war is now known as a meaningless war.\n\nIt is hard to say what I think about the war in Iraq. There are many families with sons and daughters in the war. I want to help them, but I also think we are hurting the people in Iraq. We are making their lives harder. They have different customs and ways of life. If we stay, we will try to change them. This will make things worse for them.\n\nI think the war in Iraq will go on for a long time. It is a complicated problem. I do not know what to say.",
            "I do not think it is right for a state or government to make laws about what churches can or cannot do. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control the church. \n\nThe Constitution clearly says this. If the government tries to make laws about the church, it would go against what is already written. \n\nSome people are trying to make it illegal because most Catholics and Christians do not support it. But that is not right. The government should not decide what churches can or cannot do. It is up to the churches to decide.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows people to be free to believe what they want. The government did plan to make an amendment to the Constitution, but that would be wrong. It would go against what is already written.\n\nThe government should not be involved in this issue. The president is pushing for this amendment because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not right. The church should decide what it wants to do, not the government.\n\nThere is no good reason for an amendment to ban this. It will not help the economy. It might even help society in some way.\n\nI have said all I need to say.",
            "The war in Iraq was a serious problem. The American government did not tell the truth about why it started the war. They said it was because of the terrorist attacks on September 11th. However, that was not the real reason.\n\nMany people do not like war. I am one of them. I think it is never a good idea to start a war just to be safe. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq without a good reason.\n\nThis war was very similar to the Vietnam War. The US government wanted to remove the government of Iraq and make a new one. But they did not think about what would happen after the war. Many American soldiers died in the war. It was a sad and tragic thing.\n\nThe US government said it would be easy to make Iraq a democracy. But it was not that easy. It takes a long time to build a new government. The US government did not think about this before the war. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nThe war in Iraq is difficult to end. If we start a war, we must think about what will happen after. We must be prepared for all possible outcomes. The US government was not prepared for the problems in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers are still in Iraq and many are dying. The US government is trying to teach the Iraqi people how to govern themselves. But it is a long and hard process. I think the US government made a mistake by going to war. They did not tell the truth about their reasons. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this. If we go to war, we must finish what we start. But we must also think about the cost. Many American soldiers have died in the war. Is it worth it? I am not sure.\n\nOne of the reasons we went to war with Iraq was to get their oil. Oil is a very important resource. I think the US government was not honest about its reasons for the war. They said it was to make Iraq a democracy, but that was not true.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon and there will be peace. But I do not think it will be easy.",
            "I am for gay marriage.  I have always been.  I believe it is a personal preference and not something that people should be judged for.  Many studies have shown that being gay is not chosen, but rather something that people are born with.\n\nI do not think that government should decide who can and cannot get married.  Marriage is a personal choice between two people, not something that should be controlled by the state.  In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live normal lives and contribute to our community just like anyone else.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to limit gay marriage is wrong.  Marriage is not something that he or anyone else should be able to decide.  I believe it is ridiculous for him to try to control what is a personal choice.\n\nMany studies have shown that being gay is not a choice, but rather something that people are born with.  It is not something that people can change, and it is not something that they should be ashamed of.  I believe that people should be free to make their own choices about who they love and who they want to marry.\n\nMarriage is a personal choice between two people, and it should not be controlled by the government.  If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without anyone knowing.  But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a different story.\n\nI believe that gay marriage should be a personal choice and not something that is decided by the government.  It is a private matter that should not be made public.",
            "You cannot put something on the internet that is not true. The internet is a public place. Anything you put there is seen by many people. When you are friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you can see their messages. But this does not mean that the school can look at your private messages. The school can only act on something if someone tells them about it. They cannot ignore it or do nothing.\n\nIt can be hard to know what to believe. Some people only joke around on the internet. It could be like a school project that went wrong. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nSomething like this happened at our school. Someone overheard a student saying something and told the school. We found out it was not true, but it was on the student's Facebook page. The school got worried because it looked like he meant it. When you put something on the internet, you have no control over who sees it. If you don't want people to know something, don't put it on the internet.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their pages or messages. If a student's friend tells the school something, it's not an invasion of privacy. The school has to act on it if there is danger. They should not listen to phone calls or texts without a good reason.\n\nA teacher should not make a secret account on the internet to be friends with students. This is not right. It's not fair to the students. The teacher should not know things about them that they don't want to share.",
            "I think the war has gone too long. \n\nThe purpose of the war was good at first. We wanted to bring democracy to a country that did not have a fair government. But now, it seems like the main reason for the war is just to show that we are a powerful country.\n\nI also think the original reasons for the war were not clear. We were influenced by past events, like problems between the United States and Iraq. If we were fighting for democracy, it would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons involved, it would not be good.\n\nI believe we made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a strong statement. But the war has gone on for many years. This is too long.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, it would be a good reason for war. But I think our reason has changed over time. We are now fighting just to fight.\n\nThe war has gone on too long. The country we are fighting will have to take care of itself soon. We are spending a lot of money on the war. This money could be used to solve problems in our own country, like poverty and poor public services.\n\nWe should stop the war. We have our own problems to solve. We should use our money to make our country better, not to fight a war that we no longer believe in.\n\nWe are spending too much money on the war. War should not be in our long-term budget. We have many problems in our country that need our attention, like health care and education.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question about something. It is true that people can see information on the internet. This is because when you put something online, it can be seen by many people. If you have a profile on a website, you allow others to see it when you add them as friends. \n\nHowever, it is difficult to have someone watch all students in school to prevent bad things. This could be unfair to some students. It is also not right to look at everyone's profiles just to find something wrong with them.\n\nPeople are worried about strangers seeing their personal information online. For example, someone on TV showed how easy it is to get information about someone on the internet. He found a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. You can also put pictures, class schedules, and other information on the internet. It can be hard to decide how much to share because you want to keep in touch with your friends.\n\nYou can limit what you put online, but you never know who can see it. My friend's high school did not allow students to have Myspace accounts. This made me wonder if the school had the right to tell students what to do online.",
            "I am a little confused. We have a lot to talk about, including the Iraq War. I do not want to be part of the group of people who always say they were against the war from the start. But, I was against it. However, it does not matter much now. Most people agree that the war was not a good idea. In fact, almost eighty percent of people around the world think this way. Even many U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq think the war was a bad idea and we should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was bad before we arrived. It was a disaster. Now, leaving is also a difficult problem. There is a big difference in culture between the United States and countries in the Middle East. This makes it hard for us to understand each other. We must respect how other people want to live their lives.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading Iraq. We must weigh the good and bad results of our actions. The war has been a disaster, like quicksand that pulls us down.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may think there are good reasons to stay, but I do not agree. I do not see a reason why we should not leave now. Many Iraqis think the same way. They say we should leave within a year. We are trying to help them, but they are telling us to leave.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, we cannot blame them if things go badly. If we decide to help them later, we will at least be seen as trying to do the right thing. Maybe we will never be seen as good guys in the Middle East, but it will be better than where we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem called gender bias in the United States. It is not just about men and women. The kind of work you do also makes a difference. \n\nFor women, it can be harder to succeed because of a thing called the glass ceiling. Even though there should be equality, it is hard for women to find jobs where they can be in charge. This is because of the way society has been for a long time. In the past, men have been in charge. \n\nIn many workplaces, women may have the qualifications for a job, but they may not get it because of their gender. It is the same for men in some industries, like fashion. \n\nSometimes, people do not take men seriously if they are into fashion. They may think that men who like fashion are not normal. \n\nThe same thing happens with men who stay at home to raise their children. Society does not expect men to do this, and it can be hard for them. \n\nBut things are changing. More and more women are getting important jobs, and people are starting to accept this. Men who stay at home are also becoming more accepted. \n\nWe need to promote people who are different and show their good qualities. If we do this in a gentle way, people will accept it. We have made a lot of progress, and change takes time. \n\nWe also have a problem with people from different places being judged. If someone from a farm has poor grammar but is very smart, they may have trouble getting ahead because of where they come from. \n\nThis is another example of discrimination. It can be between men and women, or it can be between people from different places. \n\nI do not know what the solution is, but we need to keep working on it.",
            "I think they made marijuana a less serious crime. They changed it from a crime that gets you arrested to a ticket you get for something like a traffic ticket. This means that you don't have to be arrested and taken to jail. But, even if it's no longer a serious crime, some people worry about the future problems it can cause. These problems can affect things like job interviews and other important situations.\n\nSome people think it costs a lot to arrest people, take them to court, and pay for their lawyers. This is true, especially for small cities that don't have much money. That's why some cities don't want to make marijuana a less serious crime, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in some cities, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it's okay to make marijuana less serious. This means the city can use the money it saves to help people, like children, the elderly, and those who are homeless.\n\nI think it's a good idea to make marijuana less serious. It's not something that should be everywhere, and there are good reasons for that. Also, making it less serious can save money for cities.\n\nOne problem with making it totally legal is that people might smoke it and drive cars. This is not safe. Also, in some places, smoking marijuana is still not accepted. If it's out in the open, it might be uncomfortable for some people.\n\nAlcohol can be more dangerous than marijuana because it affects your driving skills. But marijuana can still have bad effects on people's lifestyles. How people react to substances is different. Some people are careful and don't have problems, while others do.\n\nIt's hard to say how marijuana affects people because everyone reacts differently. But I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. Here's why:\n\nThe Catholic Church has many old customs that have been done for a long time. Some are good, but it is also important to change when necessary. Many Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules perfectly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people from other religions. For example, my parents' religions were different. They could not get married in the Catholic Church because my father was not Catholic.\n\nI do not think this is fair. We are taught to love others, which is a basic Catholic rule. It is hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them. I think the Catholic Church's teachings and its practices do not match.\n\nI do not think my own opinion on this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could get married, but it would not stop them from behaving badly. Some people would harm children, even if they were married. This is because they are harming children, not because they are single or married.\n\nThe Church should be fair and accept people from all religions. They should also be careful with the people they choose to be priests. This is because priests have a lot of power and influence.",
            "This is a very difficult subject. I am not sure what to think. Two things are very important here: government and church rules. One is about marriage and how it is defined. It is hard to decide on this issue without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a very special thing. It is between two people. But it is also a union of two people. It is like a partnership. The government should not decide what kind of marriage it is. This is because the government and church are separate.\n\nIf two people get married, they should be treated the same. They should not be looked at differently because of their marriage. They should get the same rights and taxes.\n\nThe question of gay marriage is also important. Two people love each other, and they want to be together. They should be able to get married and be treated the same as other couples.\n\nIf many states agree on this issue, it should be made into a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution. We should not make a big deal out of it.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends, and this makes me think carefully about the subject. I do not agree with the idea, but I believe it should be legal. I do not think it's a national issue. Instead, I think each state should make its own decision.\n\nIf a state is democratic, it will probably support gay marriage. If you live in that state, you will know how it feels about this issue. I don't think you should disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect its choice.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI already answered this question. This is my opinion.\n\nI don't think President Bush should decide for the whole country what to do about gay marriage. I believe each state should decide for itself. I disagree with his decision to ban gay marriage.\n\nI just think that the president should not make decisions for every state. He does not live in every state, so he cannot know what is best for each one. Some things should be left up to each individual state.\n\nThe president will not be in office for much longer. If a new president decides to change the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. I think each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the choice, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have the answer to that question.",
            "I do not think school officials are wrong to look at student posts on Myspace. When you put something on the internet, it is like posting it in a public place. Everyone can see it, including school officials. They can find it even if it is not under the school's name.\n\nIf school officials look at Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think it is okay. Keeping students safe is the school's job. They should do what they can to make the school a safe place.\n\nSome school officials look at Myspace to see if students are doing things they should not be doing. They go on the internet to catch students who are breaking the rules. I think this is not right. It is an invasion of privacy. But if it helps make the school safer, I think it is okay.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself more when you are writing than when you are talking. When you post something on Myspace, you should think about what could happen. Once something is on the internet, it is always there. It can hurt you in the future.\n\nIf you do something bad when you are a student, it can come back and hurt you when you are older and important. You should think about this before you post something on the internet.\n\nI do not think school officials should go on Myspace just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to look, like to make the school safer, it is okay. Parents trust the school to be a safe place for their children. I think school officials are just trying to do their job.\n\nWhen I went to school, we had drills to prepare for a school shooting. We practiced what to do if someone came into the building. The school officials were trying to keep us safe. I think they are doing the same thing now by looking at Myspace.\n\nThey were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were just doing their job to keep the school a safe place.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. I was affected by the September 11 attacks. I wanted to help. I thought we should go to another country and show them what we can do. But I now think we made a mistake.\n\nWe went to war without a good plan. We were angry and wanted revenge. I think we should have thought about the long-term effects. We didn't consider the people we were helping. They were busy fighting with each other.\n\nI don't think it's our job to help them. If they can't work together, we can't make a difference. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think the people there are fighting for themselves, not for a better country.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are not interested in improving their country; they want us to leave. I think we should do that. We went to war on impulse, without thinking. We were looking for revenge, not a solution.\n\nThe president wanted to go to war because the people wanted it. But he should have had a better plan. He should have thought about what we would do there. We didn't have a clear goal. We didn't work together. We just went to war.\n\nI don't think we can change them. They are the way they are. We can't stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We should not be there.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. We didn't think about what would happen. We were too angry. I don't think we should be in that country anymore."
