            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strict views on certain things. For example, they do not allow gay marriage. They also do not allow abortion and do not support birth control. Many people think these views are old-fashioned.\n\nSome people are leaving the Catholic Church because they disagree with these views. They believe the Church's views are not modern. The Church's views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control make some people uncomfortable. They do not want to be part of a group that teaches these things are wrong.\n\nThe Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or married. Many people do not understand why this is. They think it is unfair. But the Church says its priests are married to God. They must devote their lives to God. However, most people have jobs and families. They can balance work and family life. So, it is hard to see why priests cannot have both a job and a family.\n\nIf the Church were more open-minded, it might not lose followers. The Church could learn from other people's ideas and be more accepting. This might help it keep its members.\n\nIn the past, some bad things happened in the Catholic Church. People were hurt. It is hard to say if allowing priests to be married or having women priests would have prevented these bad things. But it is an idea to consider.\n\nOverall, I think the Catholic Church needs to be more open and accepting. This might help it keep its members and be more relevant in the world today.",

Another person might be born gay. We do not choose how we feel. I do not think the government should get involved. This is not a matter of law or morals. I do not think the government should tell people how to live their lives.\n\nThe government should not interfere with people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are. They were born that way. They should not be punished for it.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in gay marriage. It is not a matter of national security or morals.

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. \n\nThere are no good reasons not to. \n\nMany people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But, this is not true. \n\nGay couples are not the same as traditional couples. It is like comparing two different things. They are like two different sides of the same coin. \n\nBut, they have the same rights. For example, property taxes and healthcare. If you are in a gay couple, your partner cannot visit you in the hospital if they are not considered family. \n\nThis is not fair. If you are going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as others. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are the same as traditional couples in terms of success and happiness. They have the same factors that make relationships work. \n\nThe thing that often gets people upset is that gay couples do not want to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? It is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nThey are the same as traditional couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities. \n\nPeople also worry about children of gay couples and how they will be treated by society. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nIn some cities, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. But, this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in traditional couples. It is about personal choice. \n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage based on his religion. But, morality is different for everyone. The government should not make laws based on one group's morality. \n\nIt is hypocritical for the government to enforce laws that are based on one group's religion, but not others. \n\nSome people think that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma. But, this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to research and not just popular opinion.",

A medicine does not have to be against the law to be helpful.\n\nSome medicines that are against the law are used in pharmacies. We use these medicines because they are helpful.

If people understand that some medicines against the law can be helpful, they might use marijuana responsibly.\n\nUsing marijuana can be bad if you use too much of it. However, using too much of any drug can be bad. It is not the same as drinking too much alcohol.\n\nI think it would be better to let people use marijuana responsibly, not all at once. We need to change the way people think about marijuana.

            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It is not as strict as it used to be. I know this because I have grown up and attended church every Sunday as a child. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes and a purse. This was my usual Sunday routine. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together. Now, the church has made some changes. They have created a special service for teenagers that is only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families come late, and people wear jeans and khakis to the morning masses.\n\nI think the church has become more casual. This is the biggest change I have noticed. I do not understand the church's politics, but this is my view. I think the church is changing to make people feel more comfortable.\n\nSome people have accused Catholic priests of doing bad things with children. This is a serious problem. I do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these problems. Some men who are married still do bad things. Their choice to become a priest is what matters. Other religions have priests who can get married. For example, some preachers in the TV show \"7th Heaven\" are married. They have a choice to be married and practice their faith at the same time. If someone wants to get married and be a priest, they should choose a different faith.\n\nI think people are born with a certain way of being. I think it is true that some people have a problem with children because of their genetics. They cannot hide this by getting married. It will usually come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening if the person does not want to change. If the church knew and tried to hide it, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I have some thoughts on the Iraq war. When the United States went into Iraq after the 9/11 attacks, it seemed like something was not right. Many people thought the war was connected to the 9/11 attacks, but it was later found that this was not true. \n\nThe US government said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was also found to be false. This made me very unhappy. The government seemed to be lying to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who gave a big presentation at the UN, later said he was not sure about the evidence. This is serious. I think it is wrong for the government to lie to the people.\n\nThe US government seems to have little respect for the Constitution. They have been trying to limit its power since 9/11. When President Bush took office, he wanted to go to war. A high government official said that the president's son George W. Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's problems with Saddam Hussein.\n\nSome people think the war was started for a reason other than to keep the US safe. They think it was also about oil. This is a problem in itself. \n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there is a chance that the country will fall into civil war. Many more people might die. To avoid this, the US and the UN are planning to bring in other countries to help restore order. However, this might cause more problems in the long run. \n\nThe new government in Iraq is not working well. The people in charge do not have control. A group that was fighting against the US a year ago now has many seats in the government. This is causing problems and making it hard to make decisions.\n\nI do not have a clear solution to this problem.",

I know that the US is trying to build a democracy in Iraq, so it can be like the US. The US also wants oil from Iraq. \n\nHowever, I do not think this is a good reason to stay in Iraq. It is causing problems for the people there. If the US stays, it will take a long time to build a democracy. But if the US leaves, the Iraqis will be upset with us. They will have to start over again.\n\nI do not know what to say about the war. I think it is complicated. I know some families who have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want the war to end so they can come home safely. However, I also think that if we stay in Iraq, we will be trying to change their culture to be like ours. This could make things worse for them.\n\nI think the group Al-Kaida will become even stronger if we stay in Iraq. They will be angry with the US because we are trying to change their way of life.

The Constitution also says there should be no interference between the government and church.

The Constitution is like a set of rules for the government. It is written and should be followed. I do not think it is right for the government to decide which church is right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows for freedom of religion. Even though some people want to add a new rule to the Constitution, I do not think it is right. It would be against what the Constitution already says.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what is right or wrong for churches. That is up to the churches themselves. I do not see why the president is pushing for this rule. It seems to be because he does not like something that many churches do.\n\nThe president's rule is not fair. It favors one church over others. I do not think that is right. The government should not interfere with what the churches do. I do not see how this rule will help the country. If anything, it might help our society. \n\nI have said what I think. That is my opinion.",
            "The war in Iraq was a difficult decision for the US government. They did not tell the American people the whole truth about why they wanted to go to war. The government said the invasion of Iraq was connected to the September 11th terrorist attacks. However, this was not true. The American people were angry after the attacks, and the government used this anger to make the invasion seem necessary.\n\nI do not like war. I do not think the US government was prepared for the war in Iraq. The government did not think about the problems that would happen after they took down the Iraqi government. Many American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to create a new one. They wanted to bring democracy to Iraq. But this is very hard to do. It took many years for democracy to develop in the US. There were many struggles and a civil war.\n\nThe US government made the war in Iraq seem easy. But it is not easy to create a new government. The government should have thought about the problems that would happen after the war. They should have been honest with the American people about the war.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether the US should stay in Iraq or leave. The US took away the Iraqi government and now they are responsible for the country. Many American soldiers have died in the war. The US should think about how many more soldiers will die if they stay in Iraq.\n\nI was unsure about the war in Iraq when I voted in the presidential election. I thought about voting for George Bush because he started the war. It is hard to stop a war once it has started. But the US should think about the cost of the war. Many American soldiers have died, and it is hard to know when the war will end.\n\nThe main reason the US went to war in Iraq was for oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. This is not the only reason for war, but it is a big one. The US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found. This was not the truth. The US government should be honest when making decisions about war.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon. I hope there will be peace in Iraq. But this may not happen.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always thought so. I believe it is a personal preference. Many people now think it has a biological reason, not a reason caused by how we are raised.\n\nIt is not fair to give people fewer rights because of something they cannot control. I think it is cruel. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think government and politics should be involved in this. This is a personal issue, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is silly for the government to try to decide what marriage is. Some people think that being gay is a chemical thing in the brain. It is not a choice. It is not caused by how someone is raised.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they can do it without anyone knowing. But if two gay people want to get married, it is on the front page of the newspaper. I think it should be a personal matter, not a public issue.\n\nIs that all?",

Something bad might happen and they could have stopped it.\n\nYou don't know what to believe. Some people just make jokes. It's like a social class experiment gone wrong. It could be serious. In our school, something happened. Someone overheard someone talking and called the school. We found out who it was and looked at their internet page. His friend looked at it and got worried. There were things on it that could be seen as a joke, but now they were serious.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, there is no privacy. If you don't want it to be there, don't put it there. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. You cannot stop people from thinking what they want. School officials should not be friends with students online. They should not look at their pages. If it is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. If there is danger, they must act.\n\nSchool officials should not make fake accounts to friend their students. That would be the same as spying. I don't want to know about my residents' private lives. If they post something online, I don't need to see it. I don't want that connection.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, the goal was good. It was to help another country have a fair government. But now, I think the reason for the war has changed. We are fighting for a long time and it's not clear why.\n\nI believe the original goal was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have it. But now, it seems like we are fighting just to prove we are strong. We are acting like a superpower, but I'm not sure if that's a good reason.\n\nI think our original intention was pure, but now it's not so clear. When we first started the war, it was a big statement. We made our point. But now, it's been a long time and many people have died.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a dictator, that's a good reason to fight. But I don't think that's our goal anymore. It seems like we're still fighting just to fight. We don't want to end the war without a big victory.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. The country we're trying to help will have to take care of itself soon. We have our own problems to solve, like poverty and bad roads. We should spend our money on those things, not on a long war.\n\nWe are spending a lot of money on this war. War is not something we should do for a long time. We have many problems at home that need our help. We should use our money to help our own people, not to send them to fight in a war that's gone on too long.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question to ask for clarification. I wanted to know if it was an invasion of privacy. I looked at some websites on the internet, like Myspace. On these sites, people can see information about you if you allow it. If you want to see someone's profile, you need to be their friend on the site. This means you have allowed them to see your information. So, when you put information on the internet, you should know that many people can see it.\n\nI think it's good that someone looked at this information and was able to stop someone from getting hurt. However, it's difficult to know who might be looking at our information online.\n\nIf someone is looking at everyone's profiles to prevent problems, it could be unfair to some people. But if someone found information that really helped, it's hard to say if they were looking randomly or if they were looking for something specific.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and I know that bad people can see things about me. I saw a TV show about a man who was able to find information about someone easily. He got her screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in a short time. It's hard to know who can see our information online.\n\nI try to limit what I post on Facebook, but it's hard to know who might be looking. I only accept people I know as friends, but I still don't know who might be looking at my information. I heard about a school that banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that's right or not.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. It's a difficult topic, and I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up. But I'll try to be honest.\n\nAt first, I was against the war. Many people were against it. But it's not as important now. The main idea of the war was not a good one. Most people, including the United States government, now agree with this.\n\nIf we look at polls, we see that 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqis want the United States to leave. Most American soldiers serving in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before we entered. Now, it's a disaster. It's hard to fix the problem. There's a big difference in culture between the United States and the Middle East. This makes it difficult for the United States to understand what Iraqis want.\n\nSome people thought that democracy would work in Iraq. But Iraqis might have chosen a different way of living. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we have to think about the pros and cons before making big decisions.\n\nThe war has caused many problems. It's like quicksand - the more we stay, the deeper we get. I don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The US government might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I don't agree with them.\n\nIf we leave slowly over time, I wouldn't object to that. But I don't see a reason to stay any longer than necessary. Many Iraqis think we should leave now. They are the people we're trying to help. If we ask them what they want, it's better to listen.\n\nIf we leave and things go wrong, we can say we tried to leave, but Iraqis asked us to stay. This way, we'll be the good guys. At least, we'll be better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This is true in many workplaces. Women often face more challenges when looking for a job or trying to move up in their careers. \n\nOne big reason is that women are not seen as leaders in many industries. Even when women have all the qualifications for a job, they may not be chosen for it. This is because of how society has been for a long time.\n\nMen can also face problems in certain jobs. For example, men who stay at home to take care of their children are often looked down upon. This is because society expects men to be the main breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are often not taken seriously. People may think they are not experts on fashion because they are men.\n\nIt is difficult to change these attitudes. It takes time and effort. But things are getting better. More women are becoming leaders and being accepted in business. Men who stay at home to take care of their children are becoming more accepted too.\n\nWe can promote equality by showing the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. If we force people to accept change, they may resist. We need to be patient and let change happen naturally.\n\nPeople from different places and backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone who grew up on a farm and didn't have a good education may be looked down upon if they try to get a job in a big city. They may be judged on how they speak, not on their intelligence or skills.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a serious crime to have it. In some places, it was a big deal to have marijuana, but now it's not as bad. People who have marijuana can get a ticket, like a traffic ticket, and not get arrested. This is good because it saves money for the police and the court system. When someone gets a ticket for marijuana, it doesn't always hurt their future very much. But some people worry that even if it's decriminalized, it will still affect their life.\n\nSome people think it's better to not spend money on arresting people for marijuana. It costs a lot to arrest, book, and house people, and then to take them to court. It also costs money to pay a lawyer and the judge. If a community is in financial trouble, they might not want to change the laws about marijuana. But some places, like Denver, are more open-minded and think it's okay.\n\nDecriminalizing marijuana can also help cities have more money for important things like education and helping people who are homeless. People should think about the money and the rules about marijuana.\n\nSome people worry that if marijuana is completely legal, it will be everywhere and people will smoke it all the time. This could be a problem because it's still not okay to smoke and drive. Also, many people still think smoking marijuana is not good. They might be uncomfortable if it's out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can be bad for people. They can affect how people think and how they act. But people are different and react to substances in different ways. Some people can control how much they use, and some people can't. It's hard to say how bad marijuana or alcohol is because people are different.",
            "I agree with this idea \nBecause \nMany people in this group do the same things for a long time \nThey have a strong past \nIt's good to remember the past, but we also need to change \nSome people must go to church every week \nThey have rules for doing things \nBut sometimes, they look down on people who don't follow the rules \nThey don't accept people who do not think the same way \nFor example \nMy mother is Episcopalian, my father is Episcopalian, but my mother is Catholic \nThey could not get married in a Catholic church because of my father's religion \n\nI think this is not very fair \nWe should love others, but we should also accept them \nThis is a teaching of the Catholic Church \nBut sometimes, they don't practice what they preach \n\nI don't think this would make a difference \nI think priests should be allowed to marry, but it might not stop some priests from doing bad things \nThey might still hurt children \n\nMost people who hurt children will do it no matter what \nIt's not the same as hurting a partner \nSo, we should not think that allowing priests to marry will stop it \n\nI don't think so.",
            "I have some thoughts on this issue, but I am not sure what to think. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. This is a difficult problem because it involves two important things: the separation of church and state, and the definition of marriage.\n\nDefining marriage is hard because it involves many people's feelings and ideas. Some people think marriage should be looked at as a religious matter, while others think it should be a matter for the government. If marriage is a sacrament, then people might get special treatment from the government. For example, they might get tax breaks or other benefits.\n\nIf marriage is just a civil union, then people should not be judged by what kind of marriage they have. They should just be seen as two people who are together. This is what marriage is - two people who are united.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is also important. It is simply a matter of two people who love each other and want to be together. They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, they should work to make it a federal law. But making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not a big enough issue to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not right to change the constitution just to ban something. We should not make big changes to the constitution without a good reason.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is just a matter of defining what marriage is and who should be able to get married.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes my feelings about homosexuality a little complicated.\n\nI have many gay friends, and I have thought about this issue a lot. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a major national issue. Instead, each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there, after all.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as everyone else. This is why I believe it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush does not live in every state, so he should not tell each state how to make its own decisions. Some things are best left to individual states.\n\nThe president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will switch back and forth. It is better for each state to decide for itself.\n\nNo.",
            "I don't agree with this idea. Schools have the right to see what students post on the internet. Even if students are not posting under the school's name, officials can still see it if they try. They can check it at home or find it another way.\n\nThe main reason schools do this is to keep students safe. If they see something that could lead to trouble, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. I think it's okay for schools to do this.\n\nSome people might think it's wrong for schools to check the internet for students. But if it helps keep the school safe, I don't see a problem. Schools can check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking. They do this to catch students who are breaking the rules.\n\nHowever, if they are just checking the internet to get students in trouble, that is different. That's not okay. \n\nSchools have to make sure students are safe. They do this by practicing things like lockdowns and drills in case of emergencies like a terrorist attack. This is like what happened at Columbine. So, schools are just trying to make sure they can keep students safe.\n\nI think it's better for schools to check the internet to keep students safe. If they can prevent something bad from happening, that's a good thing.",
            "I have mixed feelings about going to war in a country. At first, I thought I wanted to go because my country was attacked on 9/11. However, I was young and emotional at the time. I wanted to fight back and cause problems in the country where the attack happened.\n\nBut, I think we made a mistake. We did not think carefully about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to the country without a clear plan and without being prepared for what we might face. This led to problems and made things worse.\n\nI now think that we should not have gotten involved. The people in the country were already fighting among themselves. We going in was not going to solve their problems. In fact, it made things more complicated.\n\nI think the people in the country are different from us. They think about war in a different way. They do not want to change their country to be more like ours. They are not looking to make their country better; they are looking for a way to get rid of us.\n\nI think we should have left them alone. We were not thinking clearly when we went to war. We were too emotional and angry. We were looking for revenge, not a way to solve problems.\n\nI believe that President Bush made a big mistake. He declared war without thinking carefully about what we were doing. He was under pressure from the people, but he should have been more careful.\n\nI don't think we could have avoided going to war, but we could have been more careful and planned better. We needed to have a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve and how we were going to do it.\n\nBut, we did not have a good plan. We did not work together as a team. We did not think about the consequences of our actions. We just went in without thinking.\n\nIn the end, I think we are not the right people to change the country. They are too different from us. We are just making things worse by staying there. We need to leave and let them solve their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strict views on certain things. For example, they do not allow gay marriage. They also do not allow abortion and do not support birth control. Many people think these views are old-fashioned.\n\nSome people are leaving the Catholic Church because they disagree with these views. They believe the Church's views are not modern. The Church's views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control make some people uncomfortable. They do not want to be part of a group that teaches these things are wrong.\n\nThe Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or married. Many people do not understand why this is. They think it is unfair. But the Church says its priests are married to God. They must devote their lives to God. However, most people have jobs and families. They can balance work and family life. So, it is hard to see why priests cannot have both a job and a family.\n\nIf the Church were more open-minded, it might not lose followers. The Church could learn from other people's ideas and be more accepting. This might help it keep its members.\n\nIn the past, some bad things happened in the Catholic Church. People were hurt. It is hard to say if allowing priests to be married or having women priests would have prevented these bad things. But it is an idea to consider.\n\nOverall, I think the Catholic Church needs to be more open and accepting. This might help it keep its members and be more relevant in the world today.",

Another person might be born gay. We do not choose how we feel. I do not think the government should get involved. This is not a matter of law or morals. I do not think the government should tell people how to live their lives.\n\nThe government should not interfere with people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are. They were born that way. They should not be punished for it.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in gay marriage. It is not a matter of national security or morals.

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. \n\nThere are no good reasons not to. \n\nMany people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But, this is not true. \n\nGay couples are not the same as traditional couples. It is like comparing two different things. They are like two different sides of the same coin. \n\nBut, they have the same rights. For example, property taxes and healthcare. If you are in a gay couple, your partner cannot visit you in the hospital if they are not considered family. \n\nThis is not fair. If you are going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as others. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are the same as traditional couples in terms of success and happiness. They have the same factors that make relationships work. \n\nThe thing that often gets people upset is that gay couples do not want to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? It is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nThey are the same as traditional couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities. \n\nPeople also worry about children of gay couples and how they will be treated by society. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nIn some cities, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. But, this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in traditional couples. It is about personal choice. \n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage based on his religion. But, morality is different for everyone. The government should not make laws based on one group's morality. \n\nIt is hypocritical for the government to enforce laws that are based on one group's religion, but not others. \n\nSome people think that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma. But, this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to research and not just popular opinion.",

A medicine does not have to be against the law to be helpful.\n\nSome medicines that are against the law are used in pharmacies. We use these medicines because they are helpful.

If people understand that some medicines against the law can be helpful, they might use marijuana responsibly.\n\nUsing marijuana can be bad if you use too much of it. However, using too much of any drug can be bad. It is not the same as drinking too much alcohol.\n\nI think it would be better to let people use marijuana responsibly, not all at once. We need to change the way people think about marijuana.

            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It is not as strict as it used to be. I know this because I have grown up and attended church every Sunday as a child. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes and a purse. This was my usual Sunday routine. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together. Now, the church has made some changes. They have created a special service for teenagers that is only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families come late, and people wear jeans and khakis to the morning masses.\n\nI think the church has become more casual. This is the biggest change I have noticed. I do not understand the church's politics, but this is my view. I think the church is changing to make people feel more comfortable.\n\nSome people have accused Catholic priests of doing bad things with children. This is a serious problem. I do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these problems. Some men who are married still do bad things. Their choice to become a priest is what matters. Other religions have priests who can get married. For example, some preachers in the TV show \"7th Heaven\" are married. They have a choice to be married and practice their faith at the same time. If someone wants to get married and be a priest, they should choose a different faith.\n\nI think people are born with a certain way of being. I think it is true that some people have a problem with children because of their genetics. They cannot hide this by getting married. It will usually come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening if the person does not want to change. If the church knew and tried to hide it, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I have some thoughts on the Iraq war. When the United States went into Iraq after the 9/11 attacks, it seemed like something was not right. Many people thought the war was connected to the 9/11 attacks, but it was later found that this was not true. \n\nThe US government said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was also found to be false. This made me very unhappy. The government seemed to be lying to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who gave a big presentation at the UN, later said he was not sure about the evidence. This is serious. I think it is wrong for the government to lie to the people.\n\nThe US government seems to have little respect for the Constitution. They have been trying to limit its power since 9/11. When President Bush took office, he wanted to go to war. A high government official said that the president's son George W. Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's problems with Saddam Hussein.\n\nSome people think the war was started for a reason other than to keep the US safe. They think it was also about oil. This is a problem in itself. \n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there is a chance that the country will fall into civil war. Many more people might die. To avoid this, the US and the UN are planning to bring in other countries to help restore order. However, this might cause more problems in the long run. \n\nThe new government in Iraq is not working well. The people in charge do not have control. A group that was fighting against the US a year ago now has many seats in the government. This is causing problems and making it hard to make decisions.\n\nI do not have a clear solution to this problem.",

I know that the US is trying to build a democracy in Iraq, so it can be like the US. The US also wants oil from Iraq. \n\nHowever, I do not think this is a good reason to stay in Iraq. It is causing problems for the people there. If the US stays, it will take a long time to build a democracy. But if the US leaves, the Iraqis will be upset with us. They will have to start over again.\n\nI do not know what to say about the war. I think it is complicated. I know some families who have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want the war to end so they can come home safely. However, I also think that if we stay in Iraq, we will be trying to change their culture to be like ours. This could make things worse for them.\n\nI think the group Al-Kaida will become even stronger if we stay in Iraq. They will be angry with the US because we are trying to change their way of life.

The Constitution also says there should be no interference between the government and church.

The Constitution is like a set of rules for the government. It is written and should be followed. I do not think it is right for the government to decide which church is right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows for freedom of religion. Even though some people want to add a new rule to the Constitution, I do not think it is right. It would be against what the Constitution already says.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what is right or wrong for churches. That is up to the churches themselves. I do not see why the president is pushing for this rule. It seems to be because he does not like something that many churches do.\n\nThe president's rule is not fair. It favors one church over others. I do not think that is right. The government should not interfere with what the churches do. I do not see how this rule will help the country. If anything, it might help our society. \n\nI have said what I think. That is my opinion.",
            "The war in Iraq was a difficult decision for the US government. They did not tell the American people the whole truth about why they wanted to go to war. The government said the invasion of Iraq was connected to the September 11th terrorist attacks. However, this was not true. The American people were angry after the attacks, and the government used this anger to make the invasion seem necessary.\n\nI do not like war. I do not think the US government was prepared for the war in Iraq. The government did not think about the problems that would happen after they took down the Iraqi government. Many American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to create a new one. They wanted to bring democracy to Iraq. But this is very hard to do. It took many years for democracy to develop in the US. There were many struggles and a civil war.\n\nThe US government made the war in Iraq seem easy. But it is not easy to create a new government. The government should have thought about the problems that would happen after the war. They should have been honest with the American people about the war.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether the US should stay in Iraq or leave. The US took away the Iraqi government and now they are responsible for the country. Many American soldiers have died in the war. The US should think about how many more soldiers will die if they stay in Iraq.\n\nI was unsure about the war in Iraq when I voted in the presidential election. I thought about voting for George Bush because he started the war. It is hard to stop a war once it has started. But the US should think about the cost of the war. Many American soldiers have died, and it is hard to know when the war will end.\n\nThe main reason the US went to war in Iraq was for oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. This is not the only reason for war, but it is a big one. The US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found. This was not the truth. The US government should be honest when making decisions about war.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon. I hope there will be peace in Iraq. But this may not happen.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always thought so. I believe it is a personal preference. Many people now think it has a biological reason, not a reason caused by how we are raised.\n\nIt is not fair to give people fewer rights because of something they cannot control. I think it is cruel. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think government and politics should be involved in this. This is a personal issue, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is silly for the government to try to decide what marriage is. Some people think that being gay is a chemical thing in the brain. It is not a choice. It is not caused by how someone is raised.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they can do it without anyone knowing. But if two gay people want to get married, it is on the front page of the newspaper. I think it should be a personal matter, not a public issue.\n\nIs that all?",

Something bad might happen and they could have stopped it.\n\nYou don't know what to believe. Some people just make jokes. It's like a social class experiment gone wrong. It could be serious. In our school, something happened. Someone overheard someone talking and called the school. We found out who it was and looked at their internet page. His friend looked at it and got worried. There were things on it that could be seen as a joke, but now they were serious.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, there is no privacy. If you don't want it to be there, don't put it there. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. You cannot stop people from thinking what they want. School officials should not be friends with students online. They should not look at their pages. If it is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. If there is danger, they must act.\n\nSchool officials should not make fake accounts to friend their students. That would be the same as spying. I don't want to know about my residents' private lives. If they post something online, I don't need to see it. I don't want that connection.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, the goal was good. It was to help another country have a fair government. But now, I think the reason for the war has changed. We are fighting for a long time and it's not clear why.\n\nI believe the original goal was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have it. But now, it seems like we are fighting just to prove we are strong. We are acting like a superpower, but I'm not sure if that's a good reason.\n\nI think our original intention was pure, but now it's not so clear. When we first started the war, it was a big statement. We made our point. But now, it's been a long time and many people have died.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a dictator, that's a good reason to fight. But I don't think that's our goal anymore. It seems like we're still fighting just to fight. We don't want to end the war without a big victory.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. The country we're trying to help will have to take care of itself soon. We have our own problems to solve, like poverty and bad roads. We should spend our money on those things, not on a long war.\n\nWe are spending a lot of money on this war. War is not something we should do for a long time. We have many problems at home that need our help. We should use our money to help our own people, not to send them to fight in a war that's gone on too long.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question to ask for clarification. I wanted to know if it was an invasion of privacy. I looked at some websites on the internet, like Myspace. On these sites, people can see information about you if you allow it. If you want to see someone's profile, you need to be their friend on the site. This means you have allowed them to see your information. So, when you put information on the internet, you should know that many people can see it.\n\nI think it's good that someone looked at this information and was able to stop someone from getting hurt. However, it's difficult to know who might be looking at our information online.\n\nIf someone is looking at everyone's profiles to prevent problems, it could be unfair to some people. But if someone found information that really helped, it's hard to say if they were looking randomly or if they were looking for something specific.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and I know that bad people can see things about me. I saw a TV show about a man who was able to find information about someone easily. He got her screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in a short time. It's hard to know who can see our information online.\n\nI try to limit what I post on Facebook, but it's hard to know who might be looking. I only accept people I know as friends, but I still don't know who might be looking at my information. I heard about a school that banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that's right or not.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. It's a difficult topic, and I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up. But I'll try to be honest.\n\nAt first, I was against the war. Many people were against it. But it's not as important now. The main idea of the war was not a good one. Most people, including the United States government, now agree with this.\n\nIf we look at polls, we see that 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqis want the United States to leave. Most American soldiers serving in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before we entered. Now, it's a disaster. It's hard to fix the problem. There's a big difference in culture between the United States and the Middle East. This makes it difficult for the United States to understand what Iraqis want.\n\nSome people thought that democracy would work in Iraq. But Iraqis might have chosen a different way of living. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we have to think about the pros and cons before making big decisions.\n\nThe war has caused many problems. It's like quicksand - the more we stay, the deeper we get. I don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The US government might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I don't agree with them.\n\nIf we leave slowly over time, I wouldn't object to that. But I don't see a reason to stay any longer than necessary. Many Iraqis think we should leave now. They are the people we're trying to help. If we ask them what they want, it's better to listen.\n\nIf we leave and things go wrong, we can say we tried to leave, but Iraqis asked us to stay. This way, we'll be the good guys. At least, we'll be better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This is true in many workplaces. Women often face more challenges when looking for a job or trying to move up in their careers. \n\nOne big reason is that women are not seen as leaders in many industries. Even when women have all the qualifications for a job, they may not be chosen for it. This is because of how society has been for a long time.\n\nMen can also face problems in certain jobs. For example, men who stay at home to take care of their children are often looked down upon. This is because society expects men to be the main breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are often not taken seriously. People may think they are not experts on fashion because they are men.\n\nIt is difficult to change these attitudes. It takes time and effort. But things are getting better. More women are becoming leaders and being accepted in business. Men who stay at home to take care of their children are becoming more accepted too.\n\nWe can promote equality by showing the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. If we force people to accept change, they may resist. We need to be patient and let change happen naturally.\n\nPeople from different places and backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone who grew up on a farm and didn't have a good education may be looked down upon if they try to get a job in a big city. They may be judged on how they speak, not on their intelligence or skills.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a serious crime to have it. In some places, it was a big deal to have marijuana, but now it's not as bad. People who have marijuana can get a ticket, like a traffic ticket, and not get arrested. This is good because it saves money for the police and the court system. When someone gets a ticket for marijuana, it doesn't always hurt their future very much. But some people worry that even if it's decriminalized, it will still affect their life.\n\nSome people think it's better to not spend money on arresting people for marijuana. It costs a lot to arrest, book, and house people, and then to take them to court. It also costs money to pay a lawyer and the judge. If a community is in financial trouble, they might not want to change the laws about marijuana. But some places, like Denver, are more open-minded and think it's okay.\n\nDecriminalizing marijuana can also help cities have more money for important things like education and helping people who are homeless. People should think about the money and the rules about marijuana.\n\nSome people worry that if marijuana is completely legal, it will be everywhere and people will smoke it all the time. This could be a problem because it's still not okay to smoke and drive. Also, many people still think smoking marijuana is not good. They might be uncomfortable if it's out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can be bad for people. They can affect how people think and how they act. But people are different and react to substances in different ways. Some people can control how much they use, and some people can't. It's hard to say how bad marijuana or alcohol is because people are different.",
            "I agree with this idea \nBecause \nMany people in this group do the same things for a long time \nThey have a strong past \nIt's good to remember the past, but we also need to change \nSome people must go to church every week \nThey have rules for doing things \nBut sometimes, they look down on people who don't follow the rules \nThey don't accept people who do not think the same way \nFor example \nMy mother is Episcopalian, my father is Episcopalian, but my mother is Catholic \nThey could not get married in a Catholic church because of my father's religion \n\nI think this is not very fair \nWe should love others, but we should also accept them \nThis is a teaching of the Catholic Church \nBut sometimes, they don't practice what they preach \n\nI don't think this would make a difference \nI think priests should be allowed to marry, but it might not stop some priests from doing bad things \nThey might still hurt children \n\nMost people who hurt children will do it no matter what \nIt's not the same as hurting a partner \nSo, we should not think that allowing priests to marry will stop it \n\nI don't think so.",
            "I have some thoughts on this issue, but I am not sure what to think. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. This is a difficult problem because it involves two important things: the separation of church and state, and the definition of marriage.\n\nDefining marriage is hard because it involves many people's feelings and ideas. Some people think marriage should be looked at as a religious matter, while others think it should be a matter for the government. If marriage is a sacrament, then people might get special treatment from the government. For example, they might get tax breaks or other benefits.\n\nIf marriage is just a civil union, then people should not be judged by what kind of marriage they have. They should just be seen as two people who are together. This is what marriage is - two people who are united.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is also important. It is simply a matter of two people who love each other and want to be together. They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, they should work to make it a federal law. But making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not a big enough issue to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not right to change the constitution just to ban something. We should not make big changes to the constitution without a good reason.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is just a matter of defining what marriage is and who should be able to get married.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes my feelings about homosexuality a little complicated.\n\nI have many gay friends, and I have thought about this issue a lot. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a major national issue. Instead, each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there, after all.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as everyone else. This is why I believe it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush does not live in every state, so he should not tell each state how to make its own decisions. Some things are best left to individual states.\n\nThe president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will switch back and forth. It is better for each state to decide for itself.\n\nNo.",
            "I don't agree with this idea. Schools have the right to see what students post on the internet. Even if students are not posting under the school's name, officials can still see it if they try. They can check it at home or find it another way.\n\nThe main reason schools do this is to keep students safe. If they see something that could lead to trouble, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. I think it's okay for schools to do this.\n\nSome people might think it's wrong for schools to check the internet for students. But if it helps keep the school safe, I don't see a problem. Schools can check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking. They do this to catch students who are breaking the rules.\n\nHowever, if they are just checking the internet to get students in trouble, that is different. That's not okay. \n\nSchools have to make sure students are safe. They do this by practicing things like lockdowns and drills in case of emergencies like a terrorist attack. This is like what happened at Columbine. So, schools are just trying to make sure they can keep students safe.\n\nI think it's better for schools to check the internet to keep students safe. If they can prevent something bad from happening, that's a good thing.",
            "I have mixed feelings about going to war in a country. At first, I thought I wanted to go because my country was attacked on 9/11. However, I was young and emotional at the time. I wanted to fight back and cause problems in the country where the attack happened.\n\nBut, I think we made a mistake. We did not think carefully about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to the country without a clear plan and without being prepared for what we might face. This led to problems and made things worse.\n\nI now think that we should not have gotten involved. The people in the country were already fighting among themselves. We going in was not going to solve their problems. In fact, it made things more complicated.\n\nI think the people in the country are different from us. They think about war in a different way. They do not want to change their country to be more like ours. They are not looking to make their country better; they are looking for a way to get rid of us.\n\nI think we should have left them alone. We were not thinking clearly when we went to war. We were too emotional and angry. We were looking for revenge, not a way to solve problems.\n\nI believe that President Bush made a big mistake. He declared war without thinking carefully about what we were doing. He was under pressure from the people, but he should have been more careful.\n\nI don't think we could have avoided going to war, but we could have been more careful and planned better. We needed to have a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve and how we were going to do it.\n\nBut, we did not have a good plan. We did not work together as a team. We did not think about the consequences of our actions. We just went in without thinking.\n\nIn the end, I think we are not the right people to change the country. They are too different from us. We are just making things worse by staying there. We need to leave and let them solve their own problems."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strict views on certain things. For example, they do not allow gay marriage. They also do not allow abortion and do not support birth control. Many people think these views are old-fashioned.\n\nSome people are leaving the Catholic Church because they disagree with these views. They believe the Church's views are not modern. The Church's views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control make some people uncomfortable. They do not want to be part of a group that teaches these things are wrong.\n\nThe Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or married. Many people do not understand why this is. They think it is unfair. But the Church says its priests are married to God. They must devote their lives to God. However, most people have jobs and families. They can balance work and family life. So, it is hard to see why priests cannot have both a job and a family.\n\nIf the Church were more open-minded, it might not lose followers. The Church could learn from other people's ideas and be more accepting. This might help it keep its members.\n\nIn the past, some bad things happened in the Catholic Church. People were hurt. It is hard to say if allowing priests to be married or having women priests would have prevented these bad things. But it is an idea to consider.\n\nOverall, I think the Catholic Church needs to be more open and accepting. This might help it keep its members and be more relevant in the world today.",

Another person might be born gay. We do not choose how we feel. I do not think the government should get involved. This is not a matter of law or morals. I do not think the government should tell people how to live their lives.\n\nThe government should not interfere with people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are. They were born that way. They should not be punished for it.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in gay marriage. It is not a matter of national security or morals.

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. \n\nThere are no good reasons not to. \n\nMany people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But, this is not true. \n\nGay couples are not the same as traditional couples. It is like comparing two different things. They are like two different sides of the same coin. \n\nBut, they have the same rights. For example, property taxes and healthcare. If you are in a gay couple, your partner cannot visit you in the hospital if they are not considered family. \n\nThis is not fair. If you are going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as others. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are the same as traditional couples in terms of success and happiness. They have the same factors that make relationships work. \n\nThe thing that often gets people upset is that gay couples do not want to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? It is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nThey are the same as traditional couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities. \n\nPeople also worry about children of gay couples and how they will be treated by society. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nIn some cities, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. But, this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in traditional couples. It is about personal choice. \n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage based on his religion. But, morality is different for everyone. The government should not make laws based on one group's morality. \n\nIt is hypocritical for the government to enforce laws that are based on one group's religion, but not others. \n\nSome people think that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma. But, this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to research and not just popular opinion.",

A medicine does not have to be against the law to be helpful.\n\nSome medicines that are against the law are used in pharmacies. We use these medicines because they are helpful.

If people understand that some medicines against the law can be helpful, they might use marijuana responsibly.\n\nUsing marijuana can be bad if you use too much of it. However, using too much of any drug can be bad. It is not the same as drinking too much alcohol.\n\nI think it would be better to let people use marijuana responsibly, not all at once. We need to change the way people think about marijuana.

            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It is not as strict as it used to be. I know this because I have grown up and attended church every Sunday as a child. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes and a purse. This was my usual Sunday routine. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together. Now, the church has made some changes. They have created a special service for teenagers that is only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families come late, and people wear jeans and khakis to the morning masses.\n\nI think the church has become more casual. This is the biggest change I have noticed. I do not understand the church's politics, but this is my view. I think the church is changing to make people feel more comfortable.\n\nSome people have accused Catholic priests of doing bad things with children. This is a serious problem. I do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these problems. Some men who are married still do bad things. Their choice to become a priest is what matters. Other religions have priests who can get married. For example, some preachers in the TV show \"7th Heaven\" are married. They have a choice to be married and practice their faith at the same time. If someone wants to get married and be a priest, they should choose a different faith.\n\nI think people are born with a certain way of being. I think it is true that some people have a problem with children because of their genetics. They cannot hide this by getting married. It will usually come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening if the person does not want to change. If the church knew and tried to hide it, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I have some thoughts on the Iraq war. When the United States went into Iraq after the 9/11 attacks, it seemed like something was not right. Many people thought the war was connected to the 9/11 attacks, but it was later found that this was not true. \n\nThe US government said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was also found to be false. This made me very unhappy. The government seemed to be lying to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who gave a big presentation at the UN, later said he was not sure about the evidence. This is serious. I think it is wrong for the government to lie to the people.\n\nThe US government seems to have little respect for the Constitution. They have been trying to limit its power since 9/11. When President Bush took office, he wanted to go to war. A high government official said that the president's son George W. Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's problems with Saddam Hussein.\n\nSome people think the war was started for a reason other than to keep the US safe. They think it was also about oil. This is a problem in itself. \n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there is a chance that the country will fall into civil war. Many more people might die. To avoid this, the US and the UN are planning to bring in other countries to help restore order. However, this might cause more problems in the long run. \n\nThe new government in Iraq is not working well. The people in charge do not have control. A group that was fighting against the US a year ago now has many seats in the government. This is causing problems and making it hard to make decisions.\n\nI do not have a clear solution to this problem.",

I know that the US is trying to build a democracy in Iraq, so it can be like the US. The US also wants oil from Iraq. \n\nHowever, I do not think this is a good reason to stay in Iraq. It is causing problems for the people there. If the US stays, it will take a long time to build a democracy. But if the US leaves, the Iraqis will be upset with us. They will have to start over again.\n\nI do not know what to say about the war. I think it is complicated. I know some families who have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want the war to end so they can come home safely. However, I also think that if we stay in Iraq, we will be trying to change their culture to be like ours. This could make things worse for them.\n\nI think the group Al-Kaida will become even stronger if we stay in Iraq. They will be angry with the US because we are trying to change their way of life.

The Constitution also says there should be no interference between the government and church.

The Constitution is like a set of rules for the government. It is written and should be followed. I do not think it is right for the government to decide which church is right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows for freedom of religion. Even though some people want to add a new rule to the Constitution, I do not think it is right. It would be against what the Constitution already says.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what is right or wrong for churches. That is up to the churches themselves. I do not see why the president is pushing for this rule. It seems to be because he does not like something that many churches do.\n\nThe president's rule is not fair. It favors one church over others. I do not think that is right. The government should not interfere with what the churches do. I do not see how this rule will help the country. If anything, it might help our society. \n\nI have said what I think. That is my opinion.",
            "The war in Iraq was a difficult decision for the US government. They did not tell the American people the whole truth about why they wanted to go to war. The government said the invasion of Iraq was connected to the September 11th terrorist attacks. However, this was not true. The American people were angry after the attacks, and the government used this anger to make the invasion seem necessary.\n\nI do not like war. I do not think the US government was prepared for the war in Iraq. The government did not think about the problems that would happen after they took down the Iraqi government. Many American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to create a new one. They wanted to bring democracy to Iraq. But this is very hard to do. It took many years for democracy to develop in the US. There were many struggles and a civil war.\n\nThe US government made the war in Iraq seem easy. But it is not easy to create a new government. The government should have thought about the problems that would happen after the war. They should have been honest with the American people about the war.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether the US should stay in Iraq or leave. The US took away the Iraqi government and now they are responsible for the country. Many American soldiers have died in the war. The US should think about how many more soldiers will die if they stay in Iraq.\n\nI was unsure about the war in Iraq when I voted in the presidential election. I thought about voting for George Bush because he started the war. It is hard to stop a war once it has started. But the US should think about the cost of the war. Many American soldiers have died, and it is hard to know when the war will end.\n\nThe main reason the US went to war in Iraq was for oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. This is not the only reason for war, but it is a big one. The US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found. This was not the truth. The US government should be honest when making decisions about war.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon. I hope there will be peace in Iraq. But this may not happen.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always thought so. I believe it is a personal preference. Many people now think it has a biological reason, not a reason caused by how we are raised.\n\nIt is not fair to give people fewer rights because of something they cannot control. I think it is cruel. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think government and politics should be involved in this. This is a personal issue, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is silly for the government to try to decide what marriage is. Some people think that being gay is a chemical thing in the brain. It is not a choice. It is not caused by how someone is raised.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they can do it without anyone knowing. But if two gay people want to get married, it is on the front page of the newspaper. I think it should be a personal matter, not a public issue.\n\nIs that all?",

Something bad might happen and they could have stopped it.\n\nYou don't know what to believe. Some people just make jokes. It's like a social class experiment gone wrong. It could be serious. In our school, something happened. Someone overheard someone talking and called the school. We found out who it was and looked at their internet page. His friend looked at it and got worried. There were things on it that could be seen as a joke, but now they were serious.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, there is no privacy. If you don't want it to be there, don't put it there. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. You cannot stop people from thinking what they want. School officials should not be friends with students online. They should not look at their pages. If it is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. If there is danger, they must act.\n\nSchool officials should not make fake accounts to friend their students. That would be the same as spying. I don't want to know about my residents' private lives. If they post something online, I don't need to see it. I don't want that connection.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, the goal was good. It was to help another country have a fair government. But now, I think the reason for the war has changed. We are fighting for a long time and it's not clear why.\n\nI believe the original goal was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have it. But now, it seems like we are fighting just to prove we are strong. We are acting like a superpower, but I'm not sure if that's a good reason.\n\nI think our original intention was pure, but now it's not so clear. When we first started the war, it was a big statement. We made our point. But now, it's been a long time and many people have died.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a dictator, that's a good reason to fight. But I don't think that's our goal anymore. It seems like we're still fighting just to fight. We don't want to end the war without a big victory.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. The country we're trying to help will have to take care of itself soon. We have our own problems to solve, like poverty and bad roads. We should spend our money on those things, not on a long war.\n\nWe are spending a lot of money on this war. War is not something we should do for a long time. We have many problems at home that need our help. We should use our money to help our own people, not to send them to fight in a war that's gone on too long.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question to ask for clarification. I wanted to know if it was an invasion of privacy. I looked at some websites on the internet, like Myspace. On these sites, people can see information about you if you allow it. If you want to see someone's profile, you need to be their friend on the site. This means you have allowed them to see your information. So, when you put information on the internet, you should know that many people can see it.\n\nI think it's good that someone looked at this information and was able to stop someone from getting hurt. However, it's difficult to know who might be looking at our information online.\n\nIf someone is looking at everyone's profiles to prevent problems, it could be unfair to some people. But if someone found information that really helped, it's hard to say if they were looking randomly or if they were looking for something specific.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and I know that bad people can see things about me. I saw a TV show about a man who was able to find information about someone easily. He got her screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in a short time. It's hard to know who can see our information online.\n\nI try to limit what I post on Facebook, but it's hard to know who might be looking. I only accept people I know as friends, but I still don't know who might be looking at my information. I heard about a school that banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that's right or not.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. It's a difficult topic, and I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up. But I'll try to be honest.\n\nAt first, I was against the war. Many people were against it. But it's not as important now. The main idea of the war was not a good one. Most people, including the United States government, now agree with this.\n\nIf we look at polls, we see that 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqis want the United States to leave. Most American soldiers serving in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before we entered. Now, it's a disaster. It's hard to fix the problem. There's a big difference in culture between the United States and the Middle East. This makes it difficult for the United States to understand what Iraqis want.\n\nSome people thought that democracy would work in Iraq. But Iraqis might have chosen a different way of living. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we have to think about the pros and cons before making big decisions.\n\nThe war has caused many problems. It's like quicksand - the more we stay, the deeper we get. I don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The US government might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I don't agree with them.\n\nIf we leave slowly over time, I wouldn't object to that. But I don't see a reason to stay any longer than necessary. Many Iraqis think we should leave now. They are the people we're trying to help. If we ask them what they want, it's better to listen.\n\nIf we leave and things go wrong, we can say we tried to leave, but Iraqis asked us to stay. This way, we'll be the good guys. At least, we'll be better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This is true in many workplaces. Women often face more challenges when looking for a job or trying to move up in their careers. \n\nOne big reason is that women are not seen as leaders in many industries. Even when women have all the qualifications for a job, they may not be chosen for it. This is because of how society has been for a long time.\n\nMen can also face problems in certain jobs. For example, men who stay at home to take care of their children are often looked down upon. This is because society expects men to be the main breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are often not taken seriously. People may think they are not experts on fashion because they are men.\n\nIt is difficult to change these attitudes. It takes time and effort. But things are getting better. More women are becoming leaders and being accepted in business. Men who stay at home to take care of their children are becoming more accepted too.\n\nWe can promote equality by showing the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. If we force people to accept change, they may resist. We need to be patient and let change happen naturally.\n\nPeople from different places and backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone who grew up on a farm and didn't have a good education may be looked down upon if they try to get a job in a big city. They may be judged on how they speak, not on their intelligence or skills.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a serious crime to have it. In some places, it was a big deal to have marijuana, but now it's not as bad. People who have marijuana can get a ticket, like a traffic ticket, and not get arrested. This is good because it saves money for the police and the court system. When someone gets a ticket for marijuana, it doesn't always hurt their future very much. But some people worry that even if it's decriminalized, it will still affect their life.\n\nSome people think it's better to not spend money on arresting people for marijuana. It costs a lot to arrest, book, and house people, and then to take them to court. It also costs money to pay a lawyer and the judge. If a community is in financial trouble, they might not want to change the laws about marijuana. But some places, like Denver, are more open-minded and think it's okay.\n\nDecriminalizing marijuana can also help cities have more money for important things like education and helping people who are homeless. People should think about the money and the rules about marijuana.\n\nSome people worry that if marijuana is completely legal, it will be everywhere and people will smoke it all the time. This could be a problem because it's still not okay to smoke and drive. Also, many people still think smoking marijuana is not good. They might be uncomfortable if it's out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can be bad for people. They can affect how people think and how they act. But people are different and react to substances in different ways. Some people can control how much they use, and some people can't. It's hard to say how bad marijuana or alcohol is because people are different.",
            "I agree with this idea \nBecause \nMany people in this group do the same things for a long time \nThey have a strong past \nIt's good to remember the past, but we also need to change \nSome people must go to church every week \nThey have rules for doing things \nBut sometimes, they look down on people who don't follow the rules \nThey don't accept people who do not think the same way \nFor example \nMy mother is Episcopalian, my father is Episcopalian, but my mother is Catholic \nThey could not get married in a Catholic church because of my father's religion \n\nI think this is not very fair \nWe should love others, but we should also accept them \nThis is a teaching of the Catholic Church \nBut sometimes, they don't practice what they preach \n\nI don't think this would make a difference \nI think priests should be allowed to marry, but it might not stop some priests from doing bad things \nThey might still hurt children \n\nMost people who hurt children will do it no matter what \nIt's not the same as hurting a partner \nSo, we should not think that allowing priests to marry will stop it \n\nI don't think so.",
            "I have some thoughts on this issue, but I am not sure what to think. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. This is a difficult problem because it involves two important things: the separation of church and state, and the definition of marriage.\n\nDefining marriage is hard because it involves many people's feelings and ideas. Some people think marriage should be looked at as a religious matter, while others think it should be a matter for the government. If marriage is a sacrament, then people might get special treatment from the government. For example, they might get tax breaks or other benefits.\n\nIf marriage is just a civil union, then people should not be judged by what kind of marriage they have. They should just be seen as two people who are together. This is what marriage is - two people who are united.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is also important. It is simply a matter of two people who love each other and want to be together. They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, they should work to make it a federal law. But making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not a big enough issue to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not right to change the constitution just to ban something. We should not make big changes to the constitution without a good reason.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is just a matter of defining what marriage is and who should be able to get married.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes my feelings about homosexuality a little complicated.\n\nI have many gay friends, and I have thought about this issue a lot. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a major national issue. Instead, each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there, after all.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as everyone else. This is why I believe it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush does not live in every state, so he should not tell each state how to make its own decisions. Some things are best left to individual states.\n\nThe president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will switch back and forth. It is better for each state to decide for itself.\n\nNo.",
            "I don't agree with this idea. Schools have the right to see what students post on the internet. Even if students are not posting under the school's name, officials can still see it if they try. They can check it at home or find it another way.\n\nThe main reason schools do this is to keep students safe. If they see something that could lead to trouble, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. I think it's okay for schools to do this.\n\nSome people might think it's wrong for schools to check the internet for students. But if it helps keep the school safe, I don't see a problem. Schools can check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking. They do this to catch students who are breaking the rules.\n\nHowever, if they are just checking the internet to get students in trouble, that is different. That's not okay. \n\nSchools have to make sure students are safe. They do this by practicing things like lockdowns and drills in case of emergencies like a terrorist attack. This is like what happened at Columbine. So, schools are just trying to make sure they can keep students safe.\n\nI think it's better for schools to check the internet to keep students safe. If they can prevent something bad from happening, that's a good thing.",
            "I have mixed feelings about going to war in a country. At first, I thought I wanted to go because my country was attacked on 9/11. However, I was young and emotional at the time. I wanted to fight back and cause problems in the country where the attack happened.\n\nBut, I think we made a mistake. We did not think carefully about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to the country without a clear plan and without being prepared for what we might face. This led to problems and made things worse.\n\nI now think that we should not have gotten involved. The people in the country were already fighting among themselves. We going in was not going to solve their problems. In fact, it made things more complicated.\n\nI think the people in the country are different from us. They think about war in a different way. They do not want to change their country to be more like ours. They are not looking to make their country better; they are looking for a way to get rid of us.\n\nI think we should have left them alone. We were not thinking clearly when we went to war. We were too emotional and angry. We were looking for revenge, not a way to solve problems.\n\nI believe that President Bush made a big mistake. He declared war without thinking carefully about what we were doing. He was under pressure from the people, but he should have been more careful.\n\nI don't think we could have avoided going to war, but we could have been more careful and planned better. We needed to have a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve and how we were going to do it.\n\nBut, we did not have a good plan. We did not work together as a team. We did not think about the consequences of our actions. We just went in without thinking.\n\nIn the end, I think we are not the right people to change the country. They are too different from us. We are just making things worse by staying there. We need to leave and let them solve their own problems."
