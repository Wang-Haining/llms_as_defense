            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. They are losing followers because they are not very accepting of many things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, but they are a little old-fashioned. If they adapted to more modern thinking, they might not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Catholic Church because of its views on these issues. They see the Church as having the wrong view on many things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it and want to practice it, you might not want to be in a Church that doesn't agree.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work, but everyone else has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nIf priests were allowed to be married or if there were female priests, it might not have changed the situation. However, it's hard to know for sure. What I do know is that many people are unhappy with the Catholic Church's views on these issues.",

They are who they are.\n\nIt's not a choice, like being straight or left-handed. People are born that way. They should not be punished for their sexual orientation.\n\nThe federal government should not be involved in this issue. It's a personal matter. It's not a matter of national security or morality. They should not judge people for who they are.\n\nGay people should be treated with respect and kindness. They should not be hurt or punished for something they cannot change.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why:\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people believe that gay couples are a threat to the straight family. But that's not true. Their relationships are different, and that's okay. It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads and tails are different, but they are still the same coin.\n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should be able to own property and get medical care. If a gay partner is sick, the other partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is a basic right.\n\nScientific studies show that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships successful. They love each other and work together.\n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. This is a civil right, not a church matter.\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but not equal. If the government allows civil unions, why not marriage?\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nSome people are concerned about children of gay couples. But this is a small issue. Children of gay couples are just like children of straight couples. They need love and support, not a label.\n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. The federal government should support this.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views about gay marriage. But his views are based on his religion. This is not fair. The government should not enforce one group's morality on everyone else.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts, not just popular opinion. If we do, we might see things differently.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. \n\nSome people think that just because a medicine is illegal, it is not helpful. I do not agree. \n\nI think it is not a good idea to make a medicine available to the public if it is illegal. No, I do not think it is a good idea. However, I do think it is okay to use a medicine for medical reasons, even if it is illegal. \n\nThere are medicines that are illegal but still helpful. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are all controlled substances. We use them in the pharmacy because they are helpful. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because it is illegal, that is not fair. \n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause harm. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause harm. It is a difficult question. I think we should be able to use marijuana responsibly. We can do this by allowing it to become legal gradually, not all at once. \n\nIf we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly. They might use it for medical reasons, which is a good thing. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is an illegal drug. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore a nice dress and matching shoes and purse. I attended a private school with my friends. We saw each other every weekend.\n\nNow, the church has made changes. They now have a \"teenager mass\" that is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually during the summer. They even wear beach clothes right after the beach. Families are often late for morning masses. People wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up.\n\nThe biggest change I have noticed is this more casual atmosphere. That is the main thing about the church I know. I do not know about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations of priests abusing children, I do not think these problems could have been avoided by changing the church's rules, such as allowing married priests or priests to marry. Some people who are married still abuse children. Their behavior is not because of their marital status.\n\nIt is also a person's choice to become a priest. There are other religions that allow married people to be clergy. They can still practice their faith and be married. If they want to do both, they might choose a different faith.\n\nI think abuse is based on genetics. People are born with these feelings. Their upbringing may play a small part, but it is mostly their genetics. You cannot hide this through marriage. It would usually come out eventually. I do not think the church could have prevented this from happening.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that is a serious issue. However, I do not think they knew in all cases. \n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. The United States went to war in Iraq after the September 11th attacks in 2001. The Bush administration said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. Colin Powell, who was a high official, later said that he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations. This is very bad behavior for a government official.\n\nThe Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution and tried to limit its power. They wanted to go to war, but the Constitution says that the government must have a good reason to go to war.\n\nSome people think that President Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's old problems with Saddam Hussein. Bush also wanted to get more oil from Iraq.\n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there might be more problems and more people might die. The US and other countries are trying to work together to help Iraq, but it is not working well. The government in Iraq is not strong and has many problems.\n\nI do not know what to say about this situation. I do not think that the US should have gone to war, but now we cannot just leave.",
            "I have some thoughts about the War in Iraq.\n\nFirst, I am not clear about the situation. I don't know the details. I think the war was not officially declared by the US government. It was a reaction to the attacks on the United States on September 11.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to stay in Iraq. Many people are unhappy about the war. We are using a lot of resources, and it's making a difficult situation worse. \n\nI also think about the Vietnam War. It was an undeclared war, and it's now considered a meaningless war. I don't want the same thing to happen with the War in Iraq.\n\nBut, I also think about the people in Iraq who have families and lives. They are suffering because of the war. We should consider their feelings.\n\nIt's hard for me to say what I think. I think we should leave Iraq, but I also think about the families who have loved ones there. If we leave, they will be unhappy, but if we stay, we will be changing their culture and making their lives worse.\n\nI'm not sure what the best thing to do is.

            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law against a church. The constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do. It is a clear statement in the constitution.\n\nI think people who want to make a law against a church are choosing one church's ideas over another. Most Catholics and Christians don't want this law. But some people in Boston and other places support it.\n\nI don't think the government should decide what churches can and cannot do. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution. It allows for freedom of religion in the United States.\n\nEven if the government wanted to make an amendment to the constitution, I think it would be wrong. It would go against what is already written. And it would be one of the only amendments to take away people's rights rather than limit the government's power.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president's decision to push for this amendment seems to be based on his own Catholic beliefs. He wants one religion to be treated better than others.\n\nIt is up to the churches to decide what they want to do, not the government. There is no good reason for the amendment, except that the president thinks it's a good idea. It won't help the economy, but it might make society better.\n\nI have said all I want to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq happened in 2003. Many Americans did not agree with the reasons the government gave for the war. They thought the government was not honest about the reasons for going to war. The government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war. I do not think the US government was ready for the consequences of war. Many American soldiers died in Iraq. This is very sad. The US removed the government of Iraq. But they did not plan well for the future.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government. They wanted to put a new government in place. But they did not think about the problems that would come after. The US is still in Iraq now. Many Americans are still dying. The US is trying to help the Iraqi military and police learn to control their country.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war in Iraq would be easy to win. But it is not easy to create a democracy. It took many years for the US to become a democratic country. The US government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for President Bush. One reason was that I thought he should finish what he started. But now I am not sure. The US is still in Iraq after a long time. We took away their government and way of life. Should we leave now? That is a difficult question.\n\nThe US is risking many American lives in Iraq. Is it worth it? We went to war for a free democratic Iraq. But why not for other countries? I think it is really about oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being attacked. The US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I am not sure that will happen.",
            "I think gay marriage is right. I have always thought so. This is a personal matter. Many experts now say that a person's sexual preference is not their choice. It is in their body. They cannot change it.\n\nThe government should not control this. It is not a state issue. It is a personal and family matter. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married. But they behave like other families. They take care of their dogs and go for walks.\n\nThe President of the United States is trying to decide what marriage is. This is not his job. It is not right for him to decide.\n\nExperts say that some people are born gay. It may be because of a chemical in their brain. It is not because of how they are raised. For example, if a boy has many sisters and no father, it does not make him gay.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to marry, they can do it in secret. But if two gay people want to marry, it is a public issue.\n\nThis should be a private matter, not a matter for the government or the country.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Anyone can see it. This is very important to remember. As a resident advisor, I have seen this happen before. \n\nWhen you post something online, it can affect people's opinions about you. If you talk about something bad, like violence, someone will share it. The internet is open to everyone. If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you may see what they post.\n\nThis can be a problem. Schools may find out about something you posted. They cannot ignore it because they have to keep everyone safe. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it is also hard to know what to believe. Some people just make jokes online. For example, maybe someone in a class did an experiment that went wrong on purpose. Or it could be a real problem.\n\nRecently, something happened at our school. Someone overheard someone talking about something, and they reported it. We found out who the person was, and we looked at their Facebook page. There were things on there that they meant as jokes, but they were taken seriously. \n\nWhen you post things online, it is like sharing them with everyone. You cannot control who sees them. If you don't want someone to know something, don't share it online. You cannot stop people from thinking what they want to think.\n\nSchool officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not read their private messages either. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I think it's best not to connect with my residents online.

We started the war to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair system. But now, the war has gone on for many years. This is a long time.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. But I'm not sure that's still our goal. It seems we're just fighting because we want to fight.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. The country we're helping will have to take care of itself soon. We should stop spending a lot of money on this war. We have problems in our own country that we should be solving, like poverty and poor schools.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on this war. This money could be used to fix problems in our own country. We need to spend our money on things that help our own citizens, like health care and roads.\n\nI think we should stop the war because it's costly and not solving the problem we started with. We should focus on helping our own country instead.",
            "You have a question. You think it's good that someone stopped something bad from happening because they looked at someone's information on the internet. This is on websites like Myspace or Facebook. If you put information on the internet, it's likely many people will see it. You can control who sees your information by accepting them as friends, but this means you are giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's hard to control who sees information on the internet. One person can't look at everyone's profiles all the time. But if someone is looking at many profiles to prevent bad things from happening, it might be unfair. They might think only certain people are bad.\n\nYou have a Facebook account and it bothers you that strangers can see things about you. You saw a TV show about a man who easily got information about someone online. He got their screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in just a minute. This is why you limit what you put on Facebook, but you also want to stay in touch with friends.\n\nMany people worry about this issue. Your roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. But you're not sure if this is right. Can schools tell students what they can and can't do on the internet?",
            "I am not sure about the Iraq War. It was a difficult decision. I do not like talking about it. Many people think it was a bad idea. Most people around the world do not agree with the decision to go to war. About 75 to 80 percent of people in the United States, Iraq, and other countries think the war was a bad idea.\n\nMost U.S. soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea. They want to leave Iraq within a year. The country was already in trouble when the U.S. went in. Now it is hard to leave. There is a big difference between American culture and the culture in the Middle East. It is hard to bring democracy to countries where people want to make their own choices.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad ruler, but the U.S. should have thought about the consequences before going to war. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It is hard to get out. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may have some ideas for staying, but I do not agree with them.\n\nIf the U.S. leaves Iraq slowly over time, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should. Many Iraqis want the U.S. to leave within a year. Some want the U.S. to leave now. These are the people we are trying to help.\n\nI think it is better to do what Iraqis want. If they tell us to leave, then it is not our responsibility if things go badly. If we decide to help them after they ask us to leave, we can be seen as trying to help. It is not easy to be seen as the good guy in the Middle East. But it is better than where we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem is called gender discrimination.\n\nIn the US, women have an especially hard time. They often face a \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from getting to the top of their jobs. Even when they have all the qualifications for a job, they may not get promoted because society has not seen many women in leadership positions in the past.\n\nThe same thing can happen to men in certain jobs, like in the fashion industry. People may not take them seriously if they are not like other men in the fashion industry. This can be because men in the fashion industry have different styles of life.\n\nIn many areas, men are expected to be the main earners of a family. If a man stays home to take care of the children, people may think it's strange. This can be hard for men who want to be with their children and help raise them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people may not take men seriously if they are straight. They may think men who like fashion are not like other men.\n\nTo change this, we need to work slowly and carefully. We have made a lot of progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. As women get more jobs and become CEOs, people are starting to accept them more. The same is happening with men who stay home to take care of their children.\n\nThe key is to show people the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped. We should not push people to accept things too quickly. If we do, they will resist. Instead, we should show them the good qualities of these people, and they will start to accept them more.\n\nWe are at a good point right now, where people are starting to accept things more. However, we still have a long way to go. There are many areas where people are still discriminated against, not just because of their gender, but also because of where they are from or how they speak.\n\nFor example, people from rural areas may be looked down upon if they have poor grammar, even if they are very intelligent. This is another form of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a big problem in the US. We need to work slowly and carefully to fix it. We have made progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "Marijuana was once against the law. But it's not anymore in some places. It's now like a traffic ticket. You get a fine instead of going to jail. \n\nThis change can be good or bad. Some people think it's good because it saves money. It costs a lot to arrest people and put them in jail. It also costs money for the court and lawyers. \n\nDenver is a place where people are more open-minded. They think it's fine to have marijuana. They use the money to help the community. They spend it on schools, programs for older people, and food for those who are poor.\n\nBut some people don't think it's a good idea. They think it will make problems. There will be people smoking and driving. It's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. It will be awkward for a lot of people if it's everywhere.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana are both bad for people. But in different ways. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can hurt your lifestyle. It can make you make bad choices.\n\nPeople react differently to substances. Some people can handle them easily. Others can't. It's hard to say how marijuana will affect someone.\n\nBut both marijuana and alcohol can hurt people. They both have bad effects. It's good to be careful with them.",
            "I agree. \nWhy \nUm \nMany things they do are very traditional. \nFor a long time, they have done things the same way. \nIt is good to be connected to tradition. \nBut it is also important to be open to change. \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they must go to church every week. \nAnd \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes \nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nAnd \nIt does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nAnd \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nUm \nFor example \nMy mom was Episcopalian. \nNo \nI am sorry. \nMy dad was Episcopalian. \nMy mom was Catholic. \nThey would not marry my parents in the Catholic Church. \nBecause of my dad’s religion. \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat is not really \nLike \nBeing kind to others. \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others. \nThat is a Catholic teaching. \nBut \nIt is hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. \nSo \nI feel the Catholic doctrine says to do things. \nBut the Catholic practice is different. \nBecause it is old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway. \n\nUm \nI do not think that would necessarily be a reason to change. \nI mean \nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry. \nBut \nAs \nI do not think that would necessarily stop them from being unkind to children. \nSo \nBecause it is a different situation \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably do not think that would be a problem \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who hurt children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they have a \nSpouse or not. \nBecause children are different from spouses. \nSo if you are going to do something bad \nYou are probably going to do it anyway. \nLike \nI do not think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose bad things from happening \nI think that would probably happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made up my mind. I do not know if one side is right or the other. This is a difficult subject. It is about the relationship between church and state. It is also about how we define marriage. This is hard to do without hurting someone’s feelings.\n\nMarriage is a union between two people. It is not just a sacrament. People should not get special treatment from the government just because they were baptized. If people are married, the government should not look at it as a religious thing. They should look at it as a civil union.\n\nTwo people who love each other should be able to make a union. They should not be judged. The fact that some people are gay is not important. They can also make a union.\n\nIf the states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But making a change to the constitution is too big a deal. It should not be changed just to ban gay marriage. This is not a big enough issue to make a change to the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to make a change to the constitution. We should not change the constitution just to define marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This made me think about my views on homosexuality. I do not fully understand this issue. I have many gay friends, and I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a national issue. Each state should make its own decision about this.\n\nI think if you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that state's decision. You chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be allowed in each state.\n\nI have already answered this question. I do not agree with President Bush's decision to ban gay marriage. He should not make decisions for all the states. I do not think he should decide how each state should be governed. \n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. President Bush will leave office soon. If a new president is elected, he may change the law on gay marriage. I think each state should make its own decision about this issue. They will have to live with the decision.\n\nNo, I am not a supporter of President Bush on this issue.",
            "I do not agree that the school officials overstepped their bounds. Myspace is a public place. If you put something on the internet, you should be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. They have the right to check Myspace to make sure students are safe. They can do this from their homes.\n\nThe school officials went on Myspace to prevent school shootings. Saving students' lives is a big responsibility of the school system. I think it is okay to check Myspace if it helps keep students safe.\n\nSome people might think it is an invasion of privacy to check Myspace. But if it makes the school a better and safer place, I do not think it is an invasion. \n\nWhen you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to be private. Many people post things they do not want others to see. But once it is on the internet, it is hard to get it off. \n\nThe school officials can find things you post on Myspace even if it is not under the school's name. They can use the internet to find out what students are doing.\n\nIf the school officials can use Myspace to make the school safer, I think it is okay. They should not just go on Myspace to catch students doing something wrong. \n\nOne teacher told me that schools must make sure students are safe. We have to do drills in case of emergencies. This is to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe school officials were just trying to make the school safer. They were checking Myspace to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. At first, I supported it because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to cause trouble for those who hurt us. However, I now think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term results of our actions. We went into the war without a clear plan.\n\nThings did not go well. We did not prepare well for the challenges we faced. War is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a savage way. They are not trying to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war to get revenge. The president decided to go to war because many people wanted to. We couldn't just ignore what happened and leave it alone. However, we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and didn't know what we were doing. We created more problems than we solved. I don't think we are the ones to change them. They will always be the same.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough to stay. It will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should not stay there forever."

you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. They are losing followers because they are not very accepting of many things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, but they are a little old-fashioned. If they adapted to more modern thinking, they might not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Catholic Church because of its views on these issues. They see the Church as having the wrong view on many things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it and want to practice it, you might not want to be in a Church that doesn't agree.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work, but everyone else has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nIf priests were allowed to be married or if there were female priests, it might not have changed the situation. However, it's hard to know for sure. What I do know is that many people are unhappy with the Catholic Church's views on these issues.",
            "I think gay marriage is okay. I believe people are born gay. They don't choose to be gay. I think they should not be blamed for who they are.\n\nI don't think it's right to say same-sex couples can't get married. It's not their choice. They are who they are.\n\nIt's not a choice, like being straight or left-handed. People are born that way. They should not be punished for their sexual orientation.\n\nThe federal government should not be involved in this issue. It's a personal matter. It's not a matter of national security or morality. They should not judge people for who they are.\n\nGay people should be treated with respect and kindness. They should not be hurt or punished for something they cannot change.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why:\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people believe that gay couples are a threat to the straight family. But that's not true. Their relationships are different, and that's okay. It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads and tails are different, but they are still the same coin.\n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should be able to own property and get medical care. If a gay partner is sick, the other partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is a basic right.\n\nScientific studies show that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships successful. They love each other and work together.\n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. This is a civil right, not a church matter.\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but not equal. If the government allows civil unions, why not marriage?\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nSome people are concerned about children of gay couples. But this is a small issue. Children of gay couples are just like children of straight couples. They need love and support, not a label.\n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. The federal government should support this.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views about gay marriage. But his views are based on his religion. This is not fair. The government should not enforce one group's morality on everyone else.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts, not just popular opinion. If we do, we might see things differently.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. \n\nSome people think that just because a medicine is illegal, it is not helpful. I do not agree. \n\nI think it is not a good idea to make a medicine available to the public if it is illegal. No, I do not think it is a good idea. However, I do think it is okay to use a medicine for medical reasons, even if it is illegal. \n\nThere are medicines that are illegal but still helpful. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are all controlled substances. We use them in the pharmacy because they are helpful. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because it is illegal, that is not fair. \n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause harm. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause harm. It is a difficult question. I think we should be able to use marijuana responsibly. We can do this by allowing it to become legal gradually, not all at once. \n\nIf we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly. They might use it for medical reasons, which is a good thing. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is an illegal drug. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore a nice dress and matching shoes and purse. I attended a private school with my friends. We saw each other every weekend.\n\nNow, the church has made changes. They now have a \"teenager mass\" that is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually during the summer. They even wear beach clothes right after the beach. Families are often late for morning masses. People wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up.\n\nThe biggest change I have noticed is this more casual atmosphere. That is the main thing about the church I know. I do not know about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations of priests abusing children, I do not think these problems could have been avoided by changing the church's rules, such as allowing married priests or priests to marry. Some people who are married still abuse children. Their behavior is not because of their marital status.\n\nIt is also a person's choice to become a priest. There are other religions that allow married people to be clergy. They can still practice their faith and be married. If they want to do both, they might choose a different faith.\n\nI think abuse is based on genetics. People are born with these feelings. Their upbringing may play a small part, but it is mostly their genetics. You cannot hide this through marriage. It would usually come out eventually. I do not think the church could have prevented this from happening.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that is a serious issue. However, I do not think they knew in all cases. \n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. The United States went to war in Iraq after the September 11th attacks in 2001. The Bush administration said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. Colin Powell, who was a high official, later said that he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations. This is very bad behavior for a government official.\n\nThe Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution and tried to limit its power. They wanted to go to war, but the Constitution says that the government must have a good reason to go to war.\n\nSome people think that President Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's old problems with Saddam Hussein. Bush also wanted to get more oil from Iraq.\n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there might be more problems and more people might die. The US and other countries are trying to work together to help Iraq, but it is not working well. The government in Iraq is not strong and has many problems.\n\nI do not know what to say about this situation. I do not think that the US should have gone to war, but now we cannot just leave.",
            "I have some thoughts about the War in Iraq.\n\nFirst, I am not clear about the situation. I don't know the details. I think the war was not officially declared by the US government. It was a reaction to the attacks on the United States on September 11.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to stay in Iraq. Many people are unhappy about the war. We are using a lot of resources, and it's making a difficult situation worse. \n\nI also think about the Vietnam War. It was an undeclared war, and it's now considered a meaningless war. I don't want the same thing to happen with the War in Iraq.\n\nBut, I also think about the people in Iraq who have families and lives. They are suffering because of the war. We should consider their feelings.\n\nIt's hard for me to say what I think. I think we should leave Iraq, but I also think about the families who have loved ones there. If we leave, they will be unhappy, but if we stay, we will be changing their culture and making their lives worse.\n\nI'm not sure what the best thing to do is. I think this situation will continue for a long time.",
            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law against a church. The constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do. It is a clear statement in the constitution.\n\nI think people who want to make a law against a church are choosing one church's ideas over another. Most Catholics and Christians don't want this law. But some people in Boston and other places support it.\n\nI don't think the government should decide what churches can and cannot do. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution. It allows for freedom of religion in the United States.\n\nEven if the government wanted to make an amendment to the constitution, I think it would be wrong. It would go against what is already written. And it would be one of the only amendments to take away people's rights rather than limit the government's power.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president's decision to push for this amendment seems to be based on his own Catholic beliefs. He wants one religion to be treated better than others.\n\nIt is up to the churches to decide what they want to do, not the government. There is no good reason for the amendment, except that the president thinks it's a good idea. It won't help the economy, but it might make society better.\n\nI have said all I want to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq happened in 2003. Many Americans did not agree with the reasons the government gave for the war. They thought the government was not honest about the reasons for going to war. The government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war. I do not think the US government was ready for the consequences of war. Many American soldiers died in Iraq. This is very sad. The US removed the government of Iraq. But they did not plan well for the future.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government. They wanted to put a new government in place. But they did not think about the problems that would come after. The US is still in Iraq now. Many Americans are still dying. The US is trying to help the Iraqi military and police learn to control their country.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war in Iraq would be easy to win. But it is not easy to create a democracy. It took many years for the US to become a democratic country. The US government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for President Bush. One reason was that I thought he should finish what he started. But now I am not sure. The US is still in Iraq after a long time. We took away their government and way of life. Should we leave now? That is a difficult question.\n\nThe US is risking many American lives in Iraq. Is it worth it? We went to war for a free democratic Iraq. But why not for other countries? I think it is really about oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being attacked. The US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I am not sure that will happen.",
            "I think gay marriage is right. I have always thought so. This is a personal matter. Many experts now say that a person's sexual preference is not their choice. It is in their body. They cannot change it.\n\nThe government should not control this. It is not a state issue. It is a personal and family matter. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married. But they behave like other families. They take care of their dogs and go for walks.\n\nThe President of the United States is trying to decide what marriage is. This is not his job. It is not right for him to decide.\n\nExperts say that some people are born gay. It may be because of a chemical in their brain. It is not because of how they are raised. For example, if a boy has many sisters and no father, it does not make him gay.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to marry, they can do it in secret. But if two gay people want to marry, it is a public issue.\n\nThis should be a private matter, not a matter for the government or the country.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Anyone can see it. This is very important to remember. As a resident advisor, I have seen this happen before. \n\nWhen you post something online, it can affect people's opinions about you. If you talk about something bad, like violence, someone will share it. The internet is open to everyone. If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you may see what they post.\n\nThis can be a problem. Schools may find out about something you posted. They cannot ignore it because they have to keep everyone safe. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it is also hard to know what to believe. Some people just make jokes online. For example, maybe someone in a class did an experiment that went wrong on purpose. Or it could be a real problem.\n\nRecently, something happened at our school. Someone overheard someone talking about something, and they reported it. We found out who the person was, and we looked at their Facebook page. There were things on there that they meant as jokes, but they were taken seriously. \n\nWhen you post things online, it is like sharing them with everyone. You cannot control who sees them. If you don't want someone to know something, don't share it online. You cannot stop people from thinking what they want to think.\n\nSchool officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not read their private messages either. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I think it's best not to connect with my residents online.

            "I have a problem with the way the war has been going on for such a long time. I think the original goal was good - to help another country have a fair government. But now, I'm not sure the reason for the war is clear. We may be fighting just to show our power.\n\nI think the war started for a good reason. We wanted to help a country with an unfair government. However, I'm not sure this is still the main reason we're fighting. Maybe we started for personal reasons, like to prove something. \n\nI think we already made our point in the beginning. We started the war to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair system. But now, the war has gone on for many years. This is a long time.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. But I'm not sure that's still our goal. It seems we're just fighting because we want to fight.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. The country we're helping will have to take care of itself soon. We should stop spending a lot of money on this war. We have problems in our own country that we should be solving, like poverty and poor schools.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on this war. This money could be used to fix problems in our own country. We need to spend our money on things that help our own citizens, like health care and roads.\n\nI think we should stop the war because it's costly and not solving the problem we started with. We should focus on helping our own country instead.",
            "You have a question. You think it's good that someone stopped something bad from happening because they looked at someone's information on the internet.

You can control who sees your information by accepting them as friends, but this means you are giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's hard to control who sees information on the internet. One person can't look at everyone's profiles all the time. But if someone is looking at many profiles to prevent bad things from happening, it might be unfair. They might think only certain people are bad.\n\nYou have a Facebook account and it bothers you that strangers can see things about you. You saw a TV show about a man who easily got information about someone online. He got their screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in just a minute. This is why you limit what you put on Facebook, but you also want to stay in touch with friends.\n\nMany people worry about this issue. Your roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. But you're not sure if this is right. Can schools tell students what they can and can't do on the internet?",
            "I am not sure about the Iraq War. It was a difficult decision. I do not like talking about it. Many people think it was a bad idea. Most people around the world do not agree with the decision to go to war. About 75 to 80 percent of people in the United States, Iraq, and other countries think the war was a bad idea.\n\nMost U.S. soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea. They want to leave Iraq within a year. The country was already in trouble when the U.S. went in. Now it is hard to leave. There is a big difference between American culture and the culture in the Middle East. It is hard to bring democracy to countries where people want to make their own choices.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad ruler, but the U.S. should have thought about the consequences before going to war. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It is hard to get out. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may have some ideas for staying, but I do not agree with them.\n\nIf the U.S. leaves Iraq slowly over time, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should. Many Iraqis want the U.S. to leave within a year. Some want the U.S. to leave now. These are the people we are trying to help.\n\nI think it is better to do what Iraqis want. If they tell us to leave, then it is not our responsibility if things go badly. If we decide to help them after they ask us to leave, we can be seen as trying to help. It is not easy to be seen as the good guy in the Middle East. But it is better than where we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem is called gender discrimination.\n\nIn the US, women have an especially hard time. They often face a \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from getting to the top of their jobs. Even when they have all the qualifications for a job, they may not get promoted because society has not seen many women in leadership positions in the past.\n\nThe same thing can happen to men in certain jobs, like in the fashion industry. People may not take them seriously if they are not like other men in the fashion industry. This can be because men in the fashion industry have different styles of life.\n\nIn many areas, men are expected to be the main earners of a family. If a man stays home to take care of the children, people may think it's strange. This can be hard for men who want to be with their children and help raise them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people may not take men seriously if they are straight. They may think men who like fashion are not like other men.\n\nTo change this, we need to work slowly and carefully. We have made a lot of progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. As women get more jobs and become CEOs, people are starting to accept them more. The same is happening with men who stay home to take care of their children.\n\nThe key is to show people the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped. We should not push people to accept things too quickly. If we do, they will resist. Instead, we should show them the good qualities of these people, and they will start to accept them more.\n\nWe are at a good point right now, where people are starting to accept things more. However, we still have a long way to go. There are many areas where people are still discriminated against, not just because of their gender, but also because of where they are from or how they speak.\n\nFor example, people from rural areas may be looked down upon if they have poor grammar, even if they are very intelligent. This is another form of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a big problem in the US. We need to work slowly and carefully to fix it. We have made progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "Marijuana was once against the law. But it's not anymore in some places. It's now like a traffic ticket. You get a fine instead of going to jail. \n\nThis change can be good or bad. Some people think it's good because it saves money. It costs a lot to arrest people and put them in jail. It also costs money for the court and lawyers. \n\nDenver is a place where people are more open-minded. They think it's fine to have marijuana. They use the money to help the community. They spend it on schools, programs for older people, and food for those who are poor.\n\nBut some people don't think it's a good idea. They think it will make problems. There will be people smoking and driving. It's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. It will be awkward for a lot of people if it's everywhere.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana are both bad for people. But in different ways. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can hurt your lifestyle. It can make you make bad choices.\n\nPeople react differently to substances. Some people can handle them easily. Others can't. It's hard to say how marijuana will affect someone.\n\nBut both marijuana and alcohol can hurt people. They both have bad effects. It's good to be careful with them.",
            "I agree. \nWhy \nUm \nMany things they do are very traditional. \nFor a long time, they have done things the same way. \nIt is good to be connected to tradition. \nBut it is also important to be open to change. \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they must go to church every week. \nAnd \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes \nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nAnd \nIt does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nAnd \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nUm \nFor example \nMy mom was Episcopalian. \nNo \nI am sorry. \nMy dad was Episcopalian. \nMy mom was Catholic. \nThey would not marry my parents in the Catholic Church. \nBecause of my dad’s religion. \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat is not really \nLike \nBeing kind to others. \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others. \nThat is a Catholic teaching. \nBut \nIt is hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. \nSo \nI feel the Catholic doctrine says to do things. \nBut the Catholic practice is different. \nBecause it is old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway. \n\nUm \nI do not think that would necessarily be a reason to change. \nI mean \nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry. \nBut \nAs \nI do not think that would necessarily stop them from being unkind to children. \nSo \nBecause it is a different situation \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably do not think that would be a problem \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who hurt children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they have a \nSpouse or not. \nBecause children are different from spouses. \nSo if you are going to do something bad \nYou are probably going to do it anyway. \nLike \nI do not think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose bad things from happening \nI think that would probably happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made up my mind. I do not know if one side is right or the other. This is a difficult subject. It is about the relationship between church and state. It is also about how we define marriage. This is hard to do without hurting someone’s feelings.\n\nMarriage is a union between two people. It is not just a sacrament. People should not get special treatment from the government just because they were baptized. If people are married, the government should not look at it as a religious thing. They should look at it as a civil union.\n\nTwo people who love each other should be able to make a union. They should not be judged. The fact that some people are gay is not important. They can also make a union.\n\nIf the states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But making a change to the constitution is too big a deal. It should not be changed just to ban gay marriage. This is not a big enough issue to make a change to the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to make a change to the constitution. We should not change the constitution just to define marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This made me think about my views on homosexuality. I do not fully understand this issue. I have many gay friends, and I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a national issue. Each state should make its own decision about this.\n\nI think if you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that state's decision. You chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be allowed in each state.\n\nI have already answered this question. I do not agree with President Bush's decision to ban gay marriage. He should not make decisions for all the states. I do not think he should decide how each state should be governed. \n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. President Bush will leave office soon. If a new president is elected, he may change the law on gay marriage. I think each state should make its own decision about this issue. They will have to live with the decision.\n\nNo, I am not a supporter of President Bush on this issue.",
            "I do not agree that the school officials overstepped their bounds. Myspace is a public place. If you put something on the internet, you should be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. They have the right to check Myspace to make sure students are safe. They can do this from their homes.\n\nThe school officials went on Myspace to prevent school shootings. Saving students' lives is a big responsibility of the school system. I think it is okay to check Myspace if it helps keep students safe.\n\nSome people might think it is an invasion of privacy to check Myspace. But if it makes the school a better and safer place, I do not think it is an invasion. \n\nWhen you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to be private. Many people post things they do not want others to see. But once it is on the internet, it is hard to get it off. \n\nThe school officials can find things you post on Myspace even if it is not under the school's name. They can use the internet to find out what students are doing.\n\nIf the school officials can use Myspace to make the school safer, I think it is okay. They should not just go on Myspace to catch students doing something wrong. \n\nOne teacher told me that schools must make sure students are safe. We have to do drills in case of emergencies. This is to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe school officials were just trying to make the school safer. They were checking Myspace to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. At first, I supported it because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to cause trouble for those who hurt us. However, I now think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term results of our actions. We went into the war without a clear plan.\n\nThings did not go well. We did not prepare well for the challenges we faced. War is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a savage way. They are not trying to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war to get revenge. The president decided to go to war because many people wanted to. We couldn't just ignore what happened and leave it alone. However, we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and didn't know what we were doing. We created more problems than we solved. I don't think we are the ones to change them. They will always be the same.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough to stay. It will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should not stay there forever."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. They are losing followers because they are not very accepting of many things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, but they are a little old-fashioned. If they adapted to more modern thinking, they might not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Catholic Church because of its views on these issues. They see the Church as having the wrong view on many things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it and want to practice it, you might not want to be in a Church that doesn't agree.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work, but everyone else has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nIf priests were allowed to be married or if there were female priests, it might not have changed the situation. However, it's hard to know for sure. What I do know is that many people are unhappy with the Catholic Church's views on these issues.",
            "I think gay marriage is okay. I believe people are born gay. They don't choose to be gay. I think they should not be blamed for who they are.\n\nI don't think it's right to say same-sex couples can't get married. It's not their choice. They are who they are.\n\nIt's not a choice, like being straight or left-handed. People are born that way. They should not be punished for their sexual orientation.\n\nThe federal government should not be involved in this issue. It's a personal matter. It's not a matter of national security or morality. They should not judge people for who they are.\n\nGay people should be treated with respect and kindness. They should not be hurt or punished for something they cannot change.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why:\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people believe that gay couples are a threat to the straight family. But that's not true. Their relationships are different, and that's okay. It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads and tails are different, but they are still the same coin.\n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should be able to own property and get medical care. If a gay partner is sick, the other partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is a basic right.\n\nScientific studies show that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships successful. They love each other and work together.\n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. This is a civil right, not a church matter.\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but not equal. If the government allows civil unions, why not marriage?\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nSome people are concerned about children of gay couples. But this is a small issue. Children of gay couples are just like children of straight couples. They need love and support, not a label.\n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. The federal government should support this.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views about gay marriage. But his views are based on his religion. This is not fair. The government should not enforce one group's morality on everyone else.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts, not just popular opinion. If we do, we might see things differently.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. \n\nSome people think that just because a medicine is illegal, it is not helpful. I do not agree. \n\nI think it is not a good idea to make a medicine available to the public if it is illegal. No, I do not think it is a good idea. However, I do think it is okay to use a medicine for medical reasons, even if it is illegal. \n\nThere are medicines that are illegal but still helpful. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are all controlled substances. We use them in the pharmacy because they are helpful. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because it is illegal, that is not fair. \n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause harm. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause harm. It is a difficult question. I think we should be able to use marijuana responsibly. We can do this by allowing it to become legal gradually, not all at once. \n\nIf we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly. They might use it for medical reasons, which is a good thing. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is an illegal drug. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore a nice dress and matching shoes and purse. I attended a private school with my friends. We saw each other every weekend.\n\nNow, the church has made changes. They now have a \"teenager mass\" that is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually during the summer. They even wear beach clothes right after the beach. Families are often late for morning masses. People wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up.\n\nThe biggest change I have noticed is this more casual atmosphere. That is the main thing about the church I know. I do not know about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations of priests abusing children, I do not think these problems could have been avoided by changing the church's rules, such as allowing married priests or priests to marry. Some people who are married still abuse children. Their behavior is not because of their marital status.\n\nIt is also a person's choice to become a priest. There are other religions that allow married people to be clergy. They can still practice their faith and be married. If they want to do both, they might choose a different faith.\n\nI think abuse is based on genetics. People are born with these feelings. Their upbringing may play a small part, but it is mostly their genetics. You cannot hide this through marriage. It would usually come out eventually. I do not think the church could have prevented this from happening.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that is a serious issue. However, I do not think they knew in all cases. \n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. The United States went to war in Iraq after the September 11th attacks in 2001. The Bush administration said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. Colin Powell, who was a high official, later said that he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations. This is very bad behavior for a government official.\n\nThe Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution and tried to limit its power. They wanted to go to war, but the Constitution says that the government must have a good reason to go to war.\n\nSome people think that President Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's old problems with Saddam Hussein. Bush also wanted to get more oil from Iraq.\n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there might be more problems and more people might die. The US and other countries are trying to work together to help Iraq, but it is not working well. The government in Iraq is not strong and has many problems.\n\nI do not know what to say about this situation. I do not think that the US should have gone to war, but now we cannot just leave.",
            "I have some thoughts about the War in Iraq.\n\nFirst, I am not clear about the situation. I don't know the details. I think the war was not officially declared by the US government. It was a reaction to the attacks on the United States on September 11.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to stay in Iraq. Many people are unhappy about the war. We are using a lot of resources, and it's making a difficult situation worse. \n\nI also think about the Vietnam War. It was an undeclared war, and it's now considered a meaningless war. I don't want the same thing to happen with the War in Iraq.\n\nBut, I also think about the people in Iraq who have families and lives. They are suffering because of the war. We should consider their feelings.\n\nIt's hard for me to say what I think. I think we should leave Iraq, but I also think about the families who have loved ones there. If we leave, they will be unhappy, but if we stay, we will be changing their culture and making their lives worse.\n\nI'm not sure what the best thing to do is. I think this situation will continue for a long time.",
            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law against a church. The constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do. It is a clear statement in the constitution.\n\nI think people who want to make a law against a church are choosing one church's ideas over another. Most Catholics and Christians don't want this law. But some people in Boston and other places support it.\n\nI don't think the government should decide what churches can and cannot do. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution. It allows for freedom of religion in the United States.\n\nEven if the government wanted to make an amendment to the constitution, I think it would be wrong. It would go against what is already written. And it would be one of the only amendments to take away people's rights rather than limit the government's power.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president's decision to push for this amendment seems to be based on his own Catholic beliefs. He wants one religion to be treated better than others.\n\nIt is up to the churches to decide what they want to do, not the government. There is no good reason for the amendment, except that the president thinks it's a good idea. It won't help the economy, but it might make society better.\n\nI have said all I want to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq happened in 2003. Many Americans did not agree with the reasons the government gave for the war. They thought the government was not honest about the reasons for going to war. The government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war. I do not think the US government was ready for the consequences of war. Many American soldiers died in Iraq. This is very sad. The US removed the government of Iraq. But they did not plan well for the future.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government. They wanted to put a new government in place. But they did not think about the problems that would come after. The US is still in Iraq now. Many Americans are still dying. The US is trying to help the Iraqi military and police learn to control their country.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war in Iraq would be easy to win. But it is not easy to create a democracy. It took many years for the US to become a democratic country. The US government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for President Bush. One reason was that I thought he should finish what he started. But now I am not sure. The US is still in Iraq after a long time. We took away their government and way of life. Should we leave now? That is a difficult question.\n\nThe US is risking many American lives in Iraq. Is it worth it? We went to war for a free democratic Iraq. But why not for other countries? I think it is really about oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being attacked. The US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I am not sure that will happen.",
            "I think gay marriage is right. I have always thought so. This is a personal matter. Many experts now say that a person's sexual preference is not their choice. It is in their body. They cannot change it.\n\nThe government should not control this. It is not a state issue. It is a personal and family matter. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married. But they behave like other families. They take care of their dogs and go for walks.\n\nThe President of the United States is trying to decide what marriage is. This is not his job. It is not right for him to decide.\n\nExperts say that some people are born gay. It may be because of a chemical in their brain. It is not because of how they are raised. For example, if a boy has many sisters and no father, it does not make him gay.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to marry, they can do it in secret. But if two gay people want to marry, it is a public issue.\n\nThis should be a private matter, not a matter for the government or the country.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Anyone can see it. This is very important to remember. As a resident advisor, I have seen this happen before. \n\nWhen you post something online, it can affect people's opinions about you. If you talk about something bad, like violence, someone will share it. The internet is open to everyone. If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you may see what they post.\n\nThis can be a problem. Schools may find out about something you posted. They cannot ignore it because they have to keep everyone safe. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it is also hard to know what to believe. Some people just make jokes online. For example, maybe someone in a class did an experiment that went wrong on purpose. Or it could be a real problem.\n\nRecently, something happened at our school. Someone overheard someone talking about something, and they reported it. We found out who the person was, and we looked at their Facebook page. There were things on there that they meant as jokes, but they were taken seriously. \n\nWhen you post things online, it is like sharing them with everyone. You cannot control who sees them. If you don't want someone to know something, don't share it online. You cannot stop people from thinking what they want to think.\n\nSchool officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not read their private messages either. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I think it's best not to connect with my residents online.

            "I have a problem with the way the war has been going on for such a long time. I think the original goal was good - to help another country have a fair government. But now, I'm not sure the reason for the war is clear. We may be fighting just to show our power.\n\nI think the war started for a good reason. We wanted to help a country with an unfair government. However, I'm not sure this is still the main reason we're fighting. Maybe we started for personal reasons, like to prove something. \n\nI think we already made our point in the beginning. We started the war to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair system. But now, the war has gone on for many years. This is a long time.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. But I'm not sure that's still our goal. It seems we're just fighting because we want to fight.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. The country we're helping will have to take care of itself soon. We should stop spending a lot of money on this war. We have problems in our own country that we should be solving, like poverty and poor schools.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on this war. This money could be used to fix problems in our own country. We need to spend our money on things that help our own citizens, like health care and roads.\n\nI think we should stop the war because it's costly and not solving the problem we started with. We should focus on helping our own country instead.",
            "You have a question. You think it's good that someone stopped something bad from happening because they looked at someone's information on the internet.

You can control who sees your information by accepting them as friends, but this means you are giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's hard to control who sees information on the internet. One person can't look at everyone's profiles all the time. But if someone is looking at many profiles to prevent bad things from happening, it might be unfair. They might think only certain people are bad.\n\nYou have a Facebook account and it bothers you that strangers can see things about you. You saw a TV show about a man who easily got information about someone online. He got their screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in just a minute. This is why you limit what you put on Facebook, but you also want to stay in touch with friends.\n\nMany people worry about this issue. Your roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. But you're not sure if this is right. Can schools tell students what they can and can't do on the internet?",
            "I am not sure about the Iraq War. It was a difficult decision. I do not like talking about it. Many people think it was a bad idea. Most people around the world do not agree with the decision to go to war. About 75 to 80 percent of people in the United States, Iraq, and other countries think the war was a bad idea.\n\nMost U.S. soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea. They want to leave Iraq within a year. The country was already in trouble when the U.S. went in. Now it is hard to leave. There is a big difference between American culture and the culture in the Middle East. It is hard to bring democracy to countries where people want to make their own choices.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad ruler, but the U.S. should have thought about the consequences before going to war. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It is hard to get out. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may have some ideas for staying, but I do not agree with them.\n\nIf the U.S. leaves Iraq slowly over time, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should. Many Iraqis want the U.S. to leave within a year. Some want the U.S. to leave now. These are the people we are trying to help.\n\nI think it is better to do what Iraqis want. If they tell us to leave, then it is not our responsibility if things go badly. If we decide to help them after they ask us to leave, we can be seen as trying to help. It is not easy to be seen as the good guy in the Middle East. But it is better than where we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem is called gender discrimination.\n\nIn the US, women have an especially hard time. They often face a \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from getting to the top of their jobs. Even when they have all the qualifications for a job, they may not get promoted because society has not seen many women in leadership positions in the past.\n\nThe same thing can happen to men in certain jobs, like in the fashion industry. People may not take them seriously if they are not like other men in the fashion industry. This can be because men in the fashion industry have different styles of life.\n\nIn many areas, men are expected to be the main earners of a family. If a man stays home to take care of the children, people may think it's strange. This can be hard for men who want to be with their children and help raise them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people may not take men seriously if they are straight. They may think men who like fashion are not like other men.\n\nTo change this, we need to work slowly and carefully. We have made a lot of progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. As women get more jobs and become CEOs, people are starting to accept them more. The same is happening with men who stay home to take care of their children.\n\nThe key is to show people the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped. We should not push people to accept things too quickly. If we do, they will resist. Instead, we should show them the good qualities of these people, and they will start to accept them more.\n\nWe are at a good point right now, where people are starting to accept things more. However, we still have a long way to go. There are many areas where people are still discriminated against, not just because of their gender, but also because of where they are from or how they speak.\n\nFor example, people from rural areas may be looked down upon if they have poor grammar, even if they are very intelligent. This is another form of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a big problem in the US. We need to work slowly and carefully to fix it. We have made progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "Marijuana was once against the law. But it's not anymore in some places. It's now like a traffic ticket. You get a fine instead of going to jail. \n\nThis change can be good or bad. Some people think it's good because it saves money. It costs a lot to arrest people and put them in jail. It also costs money for the court and lawyers. \n\nDenver is a place where people are more open-minded. They think it's fine to have marijuana. They use the money to help the community. They spend it on schools, programs for older people, and food for those who are poor.\n\nBut some people don't think it's a good idea. They think it will make problems. There will be people smoking and driving. It's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. It will be awkward for a lot of people if it's everywhere.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana are both bad for people. But in different ways. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can hurt your lifestyle. It can make you make bad choices.\n\nPeople react differently to substances. Some people can handle them easily. Others can't. It's hard to say how marijuana will affect someone.\n\nBut both marijuana and alcohol can hurt people. They both have bad effects. It's good to be careful with them.",
            "I agree. \nWhy \nUm \nMany things they do are very traditional. \nFor a long time, they have done things the same way. \nIt is good to be connected to tradition. \nBut it is also important to be open to change. \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they must go to church every week. \nAnd \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes \nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nAnd \nIt does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nAnd \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nUm \nFor example \nMy mom was Episcopalian. \nNo \nI am sorry. \nMy dad was Episcopalian. \nMy mom was Catholic. \nThey would not marry my parents in the Catholic Church. \nBecause of my dad’s religion. \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat is not really \nLike \nBeing kind to others. \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others. \nThat is a Catholic teaching. \nBut \nIt is hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. \nSo \nI feel the Catholic doctrine says to do things. \nBut the Catholic practice is different. \nBecause it is old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway. \n\nUm \nI do not think that would necessarily be a reason to change. \nI mean \nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry. \nBut \nAs \nI do not think that would necessarily stop them from being unkind to children. \nSo \nBecause it is a different situation \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably do not think that would be a problem \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who hurt children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they have a \nSpouse or not. \nBecause children are different from spouses. \nSo if you are going to do something bad \nYou are probably going to do it anyway. \nLike \nI do not think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose bad things from happening \nI think that would probably happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made up my mind. I do not know if one side is right or the other. This is a difficult subject. It is about the relationship between church and state. It is also about how we define marriage. This is hard to do without hurting someone’s feelings.\n\nMarriage is a union between two people. It is not just a sacrament. People should not get special treatment from the government just because they were baptized. If people are married, the government should not look at it as a religious thing. They should look at it as a civil union.\n\nTwo people who love each other should be able to make a union. They should not be judged. The fact that some people are gay is not important. They can also make a union.\n\nIf the states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But making a change to the constitution is too big a deal. It should not be changed just to ban gay marriage. This is not a big enough issue to make a change to the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to make a change to the constitution. We should not change the constitution just to define marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This made me think about my views on homosexuality. I do not fully understand this issue. I have many gay friends, and I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a national issue. Each state should make its own decision about this.\n\nI think if you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that state's decision. You chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be allowed in each state.\n\nI have already answered this question. I do not agree with President Bush's decision to ban gay marriage. He should not make decisions for all the states. I do not think he should decide how each state should be governed. \n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. President Bush will leave office soon. If a new president is elected, he may change the law on gay marriage. I think each state should make its own decision about this issue. They will have to live with the decision.\n\nNo, I am not a supporter of President Bush on this issue.",
            "I do not agree that the school officials overstepped their bounds. Myspace is a public place. If you put something on the internet, you should be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. They have the right to check Myspace to make sure students are safe. They can do this from their homes.\n\nThe school officials went on Myspace to prevent school shootings. Saving students' lives is a big responsibility of the school system. I think it is okay to check Myspace if it helps keep students safe.\n\nSome people might think it is an invasion of privacy to check Myspace. But if it makes the school a better and safer place, I do not think it is an invasion. \n\nWhen you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to be private. Many people post things they do not want others to see. But once it is on the internet, it is hard to get it off. \n\nThe school officials can find things you post on Myspace even if it is not under the school's name. They can use the internet to find out what students are doing.\n\nIf the school officials can use Myspace to make the school safer, I think it is okay. They should not just go on Myspace to catch students doing something wrong. \n\nOne teacher told me that schools must make sure students are safe. We have to do drills in case of emergencies. This is to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe school officials were just trying to make the school safer. They were checking Myspace to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. At first, I supported it because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to cause trouble for those who hurt us. However, I now think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term results of our actions. We went into the war without a clear plan.\n\nThings did not go well. We did not prepare well for the challenges we faced. War is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a savage way. They are not trying to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war to get revenge. The president decided to go to war because many people wanted to. We couldn't just ignore what happened and leave it alone. However, we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and didn't know what we were doing. We created more problems than we solved. I don't think we are the ones to change them. They will always be the same.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough to stay. It will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should not stay there forever."
