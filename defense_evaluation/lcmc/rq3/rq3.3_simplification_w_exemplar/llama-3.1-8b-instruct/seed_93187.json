            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change some of its views. The Church is losing followers because many people think it is not accepting of some things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong views on these issues, but they may seem old-fashioned to some people.\n\nIf the Church were to change its views and think more like people today, it might not lose followers. Many people disagree with the Church's views and do not want to be a part of it. The Church is against abortion, which can be a problem for people who think abortion is okay. The same is true for gay marriage. If someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family. So why can't priests have both? It is hard to know for sure if the Church would be different if priests could get married or if there were women priests.\n\nI think the Church should be more open to new ideas. It should think about what people want and need. This might help the Church keep its followers.",

But it is not a choice if you are born gay. I was born straight, and my friend was born gay. We did not choose it.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can or cannot get married. Marriage and love are personal things. The government should not judge people's love.\n\nPeople should be free to love whoever they want. We should not punish them for being different. The federal government should not interfere in people's personal lives. They should only worry about the country's security and laws.\n\nI think same-sex marriage is a right.

Many medicines that are not allowed are used in the pharmacy because they have good qualities. We use medicines like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet. These medicines are controlled. They are good and we use them. If we do not allow marijuana because of a bad image, that is not fair.

            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the new century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church service is now thirty minutes long. People dress casually, even in summer when they come straight from the beach. Families arrive late, and some wear jeans and khakis. The atmosphere has become more casual.\n\nAs for other things, this is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know the church's politics and rules.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I do not think these problems could have been stopped. There are married men who become pedophiles, and their attraction to young children is a personal issue, not because of their marriage status.\n\nWhen someone chooses to be a priest, it is their decision. Some religions allow their leaders to be married, but it does not prevent pedophilia. A person's sexuality is based on genetics. It is not something they become due to their upbringing. Genetics are something you are born with. You cannot hide it by getting married.\n\nThe church cannot prevent pedophilia. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they were always aware of these problems.\n\nI have no other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

One of their advisors said that the younger Bush wanted to get revenge against Saddam Hussein because of a problem from the past.\n\nNow, the war has been going on for a long time.

I think we use guns to show our power and to prove we are strong. \n\nI do not think it is fair to call it a war because it was not declared by Congress. We have to declare war to Congress to make it official.\n\nI think it is a good idea to stay in Iraq and help them, but it is also a waste of resources. It is making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war, and it was a waste of time.

            "The war in Iraq was a complicated situation. Some people think the government was not honest with Americans about why the war started. Before the war, the government suggested a connection between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 attacks. However, the two events are not closely related.\n\nThe United States invaded Iraq in 2003. I do not support war. I think the war was a mistake. It is like the Vietnam War. The US government learned from its mistakes in Vietnam, but it did not use this knowledge in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad. The US government took out the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for what happened after that. There was a power vacuum and chaos. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was a difficult process.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be hard to win. It was not a clear victory. We were fighting against the Iraqi people, not a regular army. Many people in Iraq did not want the US to be there. It's hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the US government should not have gone to war. If it did, it should have planned carefully for all possible outcomes. The government was not well prepared for what happened after the Iraqi government was removed. We are still in Iraq and many American soldiers are still dying. The US is trying to train Iraqi soldiers and police, but this takes a long time.\n\nThe US government tried to make the American people believe that the war would be easy and successful. But democracy is not easy to create. It took the US many years to develop its own democratic government. The government should have been honest with the American people about the difficulties of creating a new government in Iraq.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in Iraq. We have been there for a long time, and we cannot just leave now. We took away the Iraqi government and their way of life. But we must also consider the many American soldiers who have died. We should try to finish what we started, but we must think about the cost.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic country. But why did we not do the same thing in other countries? The reason is often oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but these were never found. We did know that North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade that country.\n\nI just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace there.

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. I have always thought this. I believe it is a personal preference. Many scientists now think that a person's sexual preference is not because of their family or society, but because of their biology. I think this is a good reason to give them equal rights.\n\nI do not think the government should say who can get married. Marriage is a personal thing, not something the government should decide. I have friends who are gay but not married. They behave just like any other family. They walk their dogs and live like everyone else.\n\nI do not think it is right for someone like President Bush to tell us what marriage means. I think this is too much power for one person. I have read and heard that some scientists think that being gay is because of a chemical in the brain that is not normal in most people.\n\nI think there are many reasons why people are gay. It is not just because of how they were raised. If two people love each other, they should be able to get married without anyone bothering them.\n\nIt is not fair that gay couples have to get married in secret, like in Las Vegas. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big deal. I think marriage should be a private thing, not something the whole country talks about.",

It could be a test gone wrong, like one we did in school for our sociology class. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nIn our situation, someone overheard someone talking and called the school. We found the person and looked at their Facebook page. They had some things on there that might be funny, but now they are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. If you don't want people to see something, don't put it there. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their personal pages. But if something is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously.\n\nFor example, if a teacher makes a fake account and friends students, that's not right. It's the same as spying. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal pictures or know what they are doing. It's not my job.\n\nThe school must take care of problems they find. But they should not be looking at students' private information.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. The purpose was good at the start. We wanted to help a country with no fair government. But now I am not sure we are doing this for the right reasons. We may be fighting just to show that we are strong.\n\nI think our motives were once good. We wanted to help a country with no freedom. But now I think we are fighting for other things. It started with a good reason, but now I am not sure. It makes me think of the past when we had problems with other leaders, like Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we made our point early on. Starting the war was a strong statement. But it has gone on for many years. I think that is too long. We should have stopped a long time ago.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country with a bad leader, that is a good reason to fight. But I do not think that is why we are fighting now. I think we are fighting just to fight. We want to win, but we do not have a clear victory.\n\nI think it is time to stop the war. The country we are fighting for will soon have to take care of itself. We should be spending our money on our own problems, like poverty and poor schools. We have many problems that need our help.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. This money could be used for better things, like building roads or helping people get health care. We should be using our money to improve our own country, not to fight a war that we are not winning.\n\nI think that is all I want to say about this.",
            "I have a question. It is about online privacy. On the internet, it is easy to see information that people put on websites like Myspace. If you post something on the internet, it is likely that many people will see it.\n\nMyspace is a website where you can list your friends. You need to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you add someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put something on the internet, you should understand that many people will see it.\n\nIt is hard to have someone check all students' online profiles to prevent problems. But if someone finds something bad by accident, is that good or bad? It depends on the situation. If someone is looking for something bad, it is not good. But if they just happened to see it by chance, it might be good that they did.\n\nI have a Facebook account. It bothers me that people can see things about me. There was a TV show about a man who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. I wouldn't meet someone like that.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information online. You put your class schedule and photos, and people can know a lot about you. I limit what I put on my Facebook, but I also want to be able to talk to my friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned Myspace. I am not sure if that was right. I don't know if they had the power to tell students they couldn't have Myspace.",
            "I have thoughts about the war in Iraq. I want to talk about it. But I feel strange saying it now. Many people already said they were against the war from the start. I also said I was against it. However, I think it's not as important now.\n\nI looked at many polls. People from the United States, Iraq, and all over the world said the war was a bad idea. More than 75% of the world's population thinks so. Most Iraqis, American soldiers, and even people from the United States agree with them.\n\nThe war started as a bad situation. It became worse. Now, pulling out is a difficult problem. The US and the Middle East have big cultural differences. It's hard to understand each other.\n\nThe US government thought they could bring democracy to Iraq easily. But Iraqis want to make their own decisions. They don't want democracy forced on them. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but that's no reason to go to war.\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the advantages and disadvantages. We should not invade a country and make it a disaster. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The Iraqi people want us to leave. They even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know better.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help them later, we can be seen as the good guys. But, unfortunately, it's hard to be the good guys in the Middle East.",
            "I think the United States still has a problem with gender discrimination. This problem exists in many areas, but it is worse in some jobs than others. The issue is not just with women. Men can also face discrimination in certain jobs.\n\nFor example, some men have trouble getting promoted to higher positions because they work for women. This is because society has always seen men as the leaders. As a result, people have a hard time accepting men working for women.\n\nIn other areas like fashion, men who like fashion are often looked down upon. People think it's not a typical job for men. And if a man is a stay-at-home parent, society sees it as strange. They think he should be working and bringing home the money.\n\nIn some industries, people don't take men seriously if they are into fashion. They think that men who like fashion are different. This can make it hard for men to succeed in these jobs.\n\nGender discrimination is a problem in the United States. It will take a lot of time to change. But we can see some progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in the business world. More men are staying home to raise their children, and people are starting to see this as a good thing.\n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different. We should not force people to accept these qualities, but instead, let them see the good things about these people. If we do this slowly, people will start to accept them.\n\nIt's not just about men and women. People from different places and with different backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm who doesn't have perfect grammar can still be a great leader. But other people might look down on him because of his grammar.\n\nIn conclusion, the United States still has a problem with gender and social discrimination. But we can make progress if we do things slowly and promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a criminal offense. This means people who use it will get a ticket, not arrested. This is a good idea because it saves money for the government. They do not have to pay for court cases and jails. In a place like Denver, where people are open-minded, this is a good idea. The city can use the saved money for important things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some people are concerned about the effects of marijuana. They think it should not be everywhere. Some people worry that if it is legalized, people will smoke it and drive, which is not safe. Many people still do not like the idea of smoking marijuana in public.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana both have bad effects. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can affect how people live their lives. But people react differently to these substances. Some people can use them and be fine, while others have problems.\n\nIt is hard to say how people will react to marijuana because everyone is different. But one thing is true: both alcohol and marijuana have bad effects.",
            "I agree with you. Here's why: Many things they do are traditional. They have done them for a long time. This is good. It's also important to change and adapt. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, they look down on people who do not follow their rules. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents were not married in a Catholic church. My mom was a Catholic, and my dad was not. This was not because of my dad's religion, but because the church did not accept him.\n\nCatholic teaching says to love others. But some Catholic practices go against this teaching. This is because they are out of date. They continue to follow these practices anyway.\n\nI do not think this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could marry. But I do not think this would stop them from hurting children. It is a different situation. They would probably still do bad things.\n\nSome people who hurt children will do it no matter what. They will do it because they are hurting a child, not a partner. If they want to do something bad, they will do it. Getting married or not will not stop them.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop these bad things from happening. They would probably still happen.",
            "I am not sure about this problem. I do not have enough information to say who is right or wrong. This is a difficult issue. \n\nIt is about the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage. It is hard to do this without hurting anyone's feelings. I think civil unions are a good idea. But I do not know if marriage should be a civil union.\n\nMarriage is a very important thing. It is when two people join together. The government should not care about the type of marriage. It should just be a union of two people. \n\nSome people want to get married because of their church. But the government should not care about this. It is not fair to say some people can get married and others cannot.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is similar. Two people who love each other should be able to join together. I do not think it is right to say no to this.\n\nIf many states agree on this, they should try to make it a law for the whole country. But making a change to the constitution to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution. It should only be changed for very big reasons. \n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This is why I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have many gay friends, and I think being gay is a personal choice. However, I do not agree with this lifestyle. I do think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national issue. Instead, I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some states are more democratic and some are more republican. Democratic states will probably support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you probably know how the people feel about gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there, so you should be willing to accept the laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I believe each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage. This way, each state can make its own choice.\n\nI already said that I believe each state should decide. I do not think the president should make a decision for the whole country. President Bush wants to ban gay marriage nationwide. I disagree with this. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president does not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state runs itself. He will be out of office soon, and a new president may change the law. This decision should be left to each state, so it is clear what the people want.\n\nNo, I do not want a national ban on gay marriage.",
            "I don't agree with school officials looking at what students post on the internet. \nHowever, if they are searching for things that might make the school safer, that's okay. \nIf school officials want to know if students are doing something bad, they can find it on the internet, even if it's not on the school's website. \nSo, it's not really private.\n\nWhen people post things on the internet, they have to know that others will see them. \nThis includes school officials. \nIf school officials find something that might make the school safer, they can use that information. \n\nSchools have a job to keep students safe. \nThey can look at things on the internet to do this. \nFor example, they might want to know if students are drinking or smoking. \nIf they find out about this, they can get the students in trouble.\n\nSome people might think it's an invasion of privacy for school officials to look at things on the internet. \nHowever, if it makes the school safer, it's okay. \nSchool officials are just trying to keep students safe.\n\nWhen students post things on the internet, they should be careful. \nIt's easy to get in trouble if something they post is not good. \nIt's like writing a letter that someone else can read. \nIf you post something on the internet, it will stay there forever. \n\nSchool officials looked at things on the internet to keep the school safe. \nThey wanted to make sure nothing bad would happen, like a school shooting. \nThis is like practicing for emergencies. \nThey want to be ready to keep students safe.\n\nSchool officials are doing their job by looking at things on the internet. \nThey want to make sure the school is a safe place for students. \nThis is what they are supposed to do.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. I think it was a big mistake. I was upset after nine eleven happened. I wanted to help. But now I think we went into the situation unprepared. We did not think about the results. We were angry and wanted revenge. \n\nWe did not think about what would happen next. This caused problems. The people over there were already fighting with each other. We going there did not help. They could not fight with us because they were busy fighting with themselves.\n\nI do not care about what happens over there now. I think they are not very organized. They do not think about making their country better. They just want us to leave. We should leave.\n\nWe went to war without a plan. We did not know what we were doing. We thought we could change their country. But we cannot change people. They will always be the same. We made a mistake by staying in that country.\n\nWe are not making progress. We are just making things worse. If we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should go home."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change some of its views. The Church is losing followers because many people think it is not accepting of some things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong views on these issues, but they may seem old-fashioned to some people.\n\nIf the Church were to change its views and think more like people today, it might not lose followers. Many people disagree with the Church's views and do not want to be a part of it. The Church is against abortion, which can be a problem for people who think abortion is okay. The same is true for gay marriage. If someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family. So why can't priests have both? It is hard to know for sure if the Church would be different if priests could get married or if there were women priests.\n\nI think the Church should be more open to new ideas. It should think about what people want and need. This might help the Church keep its followers.",

But it is not a choice if you are born gay. I was born straight, and my friend was born gay. We did not choose it.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can or cannot get married. Marriage and love are personal things. The government should not judge people's love.\n\nPeople should be free to love whoever they want. We should not punish them for being different. The federal government should not interfere in people's personal lives. They should only worry about the country's security and laws.\n\nI think same-sex marriage is a right.

Many medicines that are not allowed are used in the pharmacy because they have good qualities. We use medicines like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet. These medicines are controlled. They are good and we use them. If we do not allow marijuana because of a bad image, that is not fair.

            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the new century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church service is now thirty minutes long. People dress casually, even in summer when they come straight from the beach. Families arrive late, and some wear jeans and khakis. The atmosphere has become more casual.\n\nAs for other things, this is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know the church's politics and rules.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I do not think these problems could have been stopped. There are married men who become pedophiles, and their attraction to young children is a personal issue, not because of their marriage status.\n\nWhen someone chooses to be a priest, it is their decision. Some religions allow their leaders to be married, but it does not prevent pedophilia. A person's sexuality is based on genetics. It is not something they become due to their upbringing. Genetics are something you are born with. You cannot hide it by getting married.\n\nThe church cannot prevent pedophilia. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they were always aware of these problems.\n\nI have no other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

One of their advisors said that the younger Bush wanted to get revenge against Saddam Hussein because of a problem from the past.\n\nNow, the war has been going on for a long time.

I think we use guns to show our power and to prove we are strong. \n\nI do not think it is fair to call it a war because it was not declared by Congress. We have to declare war to Congress to make it official.\n\nI think it is a good idea to stay in Iraq and help them, but it is also a waste of resources. It is making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war, and it was a waste of time.

            "The war in Iraq was a complicated situation. Some people think the government was not honest with Americans about why the war started. Before the war, the government suggested a connection between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 attacks. However, the two events are not closely related.\n\nThe United States invaded Iraq in 2003. I do not support war. I think the war was a mistake. It is like the Vietnam War. The US government learned from its mistakes in Vietnam, but it did not use this knowledge in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad. The US government took out the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for what happened after that. There was a power vacuum and chaos. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was a difficult process.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be hard to win. It was not a clear victory. We were fighting against the Iraqi people, not a regular army. Many people in Iraq did not want the US to be there. It's hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the US government should not have gone to war. If it did, it should have planned carefully for all possible outcomes. The government was not well prepared for what happened after the Iraqi government was removed. We are still in Iraq and many American soldiers are still dying. The US is trying to train Iraqi soldiers and police, but this takes a long time.\n\nThe US government tried to make the American people believe that the war would be easy and successful. But democracy is not easy to create. It took the US many years to develop its own democratic government. The government should have been honest with the American people about the difficulties of creating a new government in Iraq.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in Iraq. We have been there for a long time, and we cannot just leave now. We took away the Iraqi government and their way of life. But we must also consider the many American soldiers who have died. We should try to finish what we started, but we must think about the cost.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic country. But why did we not do the same thing in other countries? The reason is often oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but these were never found. We did know that North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade that country.\n\nI just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace there.

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. I have always thought this. I believe it is a personal preference. Many scientists now think that a person's sexual preference is not because of their family or society, but because of their biology. I think this is a good reason to give them equal rights.\n\nI do not think the government should say who can get married. Marriage is a personal thing, not something the government should decide. I have friends who are gay but not married. They behave just like any other family. They walk their dogs and live like everyone else.\n\nI do not think it is right for someone like President Bush to tell us what marriage means. I think this is too much power for one person. I have read and heard that some scientists think that being gay is because of a chemical in the brain that is not normal in most people.\n\nI think there are many reasons why people are gay. It is not just because of how they were raised. If two people love each other, they should be able to get married without anyone bothering them.\n\nIt is not fair that gay couples have to get married in secret, like in Las Vegas. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big deal. I think marriage should be a private thing, not something the whole country talks about.",

It could be a test gone wrong, like one we did in school for our sociology class. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nIn our situation, someone overheard someone talking and called the school. We found the person and looked at their Facebook page. They had some things on there that might be funny, but now they are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. If you don't want people to see something, don't put it there. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their personal pages. But if something is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously.\n\nFor example, if a teacher makes a fake account and friends students, that's not right. It's the same as spying. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal pictures or know what they are doing. It's not my job.\n\nThe school must take care of problems they find. But they should not be looking at students' private information.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. The purpose was good at the start. We wanted to help a country with no fair government. But now I am not sure we are doing this for the right reasons. We may be fighting just to show that we are strong.\n\nI think our motives were once good. We wanted to help a country with no freedom. But now I think we are fighting for other things. It started with a good reason, but now I am not sure. It makes me think of the past when we had problems with other leaders, like Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we made our point early on. Starting the war was a strong statement. But it has gone on for many years. I think that is too long. We should have stopped a long time ago.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country with a bad leader, that is a good reason to fight. But I do not think that is why we are fighting now. I think we are fighting just to fight. We want to win, but we do not have a clear victory.\n\nI think it is time to stop the war. The country we are fighting for will soon have to take care of itself. We should be spending our money on our own problems, like poverty and poor schools. We have many problems that need our help.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. This money could be used for better things, like building roads or helping people get health care. We should be using our money to improve our own country, not to fight a war that we are not winning.\n\nI think that is all I want to say about this.",
            "I have a question. It is about online privacy. On the internet, it is easy to see information that people put on websites like Myspace. If you post something on the internet, it is likely that many people will see it.\n\nMyspace is a website where you can list your friends. You need to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you add someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put something on the internet, you should understand that many people will see it.\n\nIt is hard to have someone check all students' online profiles to prevent problems. But if someone finds something bad by accident, is that good or bad? It depends on the situation. If someone is looking for something bad, it is not good. But if they just happened to see it by chance, it might be good that they did.\n\nI have a Facebook account. It bothers me that people can see things about me. There was a TV show about a man who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. I wouldn't meet someone like that.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information online. You put your class schedule and photos, and people can know a lot about you. I limit what I put on my Facebook, but I also want to be able to talk to my friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned Myspace. I am not sure if that was right. I don't know if they had the power to tell students they couldn't have Myspace.",
            "I have thoughts about the war in Iraq. I want to talk about it. But I feel strange saying it now. Many people already said they were against the war from the start. I also said I was against it. However, I think it's not as important now.\n\nI looked at many polls. People from the United States, Iraq, and all over the world said the war was a bad idea. More than 75% of the world's population thinks so. Most Iraqis, American soldiers, and even people from the United States agree with them.\n\nThe war started as a bad situation. It became worse. Now, pulling out is a difficult problem. The US and the Middle East have big cultural differences. It's hard to understand each other.\n\nThe US government thought they could bring democracy to Iraq easily. But Iraqis want to make their own decisions. They don't want democracy forced on them. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but that's no reason to go to war.\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the advantages and disadvantages. We should not invade a country and make it a disaster. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The Iraqi people want us to leave. They even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know better.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help them later, we can be seen as the good guys. But, unfortunately, it's hard to be the good guys in the Middle East.",
            "I think the United States still has a problem with gender discrimination. This problem exists in many areas, but it is worse in some jobs than others. The issue is not just with women. Men can also face discrimination in certain jobs.\n\nFor example, some men have trouble getting promoted to higher positions because they work for women. This is because society has always seen men as the leaders. As a result, people have a hard time accepting men working for women.\n\nIn other areas like fashion, men who like fashion are often looked down upon. People think it's not a typical job for men. And if a man is a stay-at-home parent, society sees it as strange. They think he should be working and bringing home the money.\n\nIn some industries, people don't take men seriously if they are into fashion. They think that men who like fashion are different. This can make it hard for men to succeed in these jobs.\n\nGender discrimination is a problem in the United States. It will take a lot of time to change. But we can see some progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in the business world. More men are staying home to raise their children, and people are starting to see this as a good thing.\n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different. We should not force people to accept these qualities, but instead, let them see the good things about these people. If we do this slowly, people will start to accept them.\n\nIt's not just about men and women. People from different places and with different backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm who doesn't have perfect grammar can still be a great leader. But other people might look down on him because of his grammar.\n\nIn conclusion, the United States still has a problem with gender and social discrimination. But we can make progress if we do things slowly and promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a criminal offense. This means people who use it will get a ticket, not arrested. This is a good idea because it saves money for the government. They do not have to pay for court cases and jails. In a place like Denver, where people are open-minded, this is a good idea. The city can use the saved money for important things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some people are concerned about the effects of marijuana. They think it should not be everywhere. Some people worry that if it is legalized, people will smoke it and drive, which is not safe. Many people still do not like the idea of smoking marijuana in public.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana both have bad effects. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can affect how people live their lives. But people react differently to these substances. Some people can use them and be fine, while others have problems.\n\nIt is hard to say how people will react to marijuana because everyone is different. But one thing is true: both alcohol and marijuana have bad effects.",
            "I agree with you. Here's why: Many things they do are traditional. They have done them for a long time. This is good. It's also important to change and adapt. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, they look down on people who do not follow their rules. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents were not married in a Catholic church. My mom was a Catholic, and my dad was not. This was not because of my dad's religion, but because the church did not accept him.\n\nCatholic teaching says to love others. But some Catholic practices go against this teaching. This is because they are out of date. They continue to follow these practices anyway.\n\nI do not think this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could marry. But I do not think this would stop them from hurting children. It is a different situation. They would probably still do bad things.\n\nSome people who hurt children will do it no matter what. They will do it because they are hurting a child, not a partner. If they want to do something bad, they will do it. Getting married or not will not stop them.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop these bad things from happening. They would probably still happen.",
            "I am not sure about this problem. I do not have enough information to say who is right or wrong. This is a difficult issue. \n\nIt is about the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage. It is hard to do this without hurting anyone's feelings. I think civil unions are a good idea. But I do not know if marriage should be a civil union.\n\nMarriage is a very important thing. It is when two people join together. The government should not care about the type of marriage. It should just be a union of two people. \n\nSome people want to get married because of their church. But the government should not care about this. It is not fair to say some people can get married and others cannot.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is similar. Two people who love each other should be able to join together. I do not think it is right to say no to this.\n\nIf many states agree on this, they should try to make it a law for the whole country. But making a change to the constitution to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution. It should only be changed for very big reasons. \n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This is why I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have many gay friends, and I think being gay is a personal choice. However, I do not agree with this lifestyle. I do think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national issue. Instead, I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some states are more democratic and some are more republican. Democratic states will probably support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you probably know how the people feel about gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there, so you should be willing to accept the laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I believe each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage. This way, each state can make its own choice.\n\nI already said that I believe each state should decide. I do not think the president should make a decision for the whole country. President Bush wants to ban gay marriage nationwide. I disagree with this. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president does not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state runs itself. He will be out of office soon, and a new president may change the law. This decision should be left to each state, so it is clear what the people want.\n\nNo, I do not want a national ban on gay marriage.",
            "I don't agree with school officials looking at what students post on the internet. \nHowever, if they are searching for things that might make the school safer, that's okay. \nIf school officials want to know if students are doing something bad, they can find it on the internet, even if it's not on the school's website. \nSo, it's not really private.\n\nWhen people post things on the internet, they have to know that others will see them. \nThis includes school officials. \nIf school officials find something that might make the school safer, they can use that information. \n\nSchools have a job to keep students safe. \nThey can look at things on the internet to do this. \nFor example, they might want to know if students are drinking or smoking. \nIf they find out about this, they can get the students in trouble.\n\nSome people might think it's an invasion of privacy for school officials to look at things on the internet. \nHowever, if it makes the school safer, it's okay. \nSchool officials are just trying to keep students safe.\n\nWhen students post things on the internet, they should be careful. \nIt's easy to get in trouble if something they post is not good. \nIt's like writing a letter that someone else can read. \nIf you post something on the internet, it will stay there forever. \n\nSchool officials looked at things on the internet to keep the school safe. \nThey wanted to make sure nothing bad would happen, like a school shooting. \nThis is like practicing for emergencies. \nThey want to be ready to keep students safe.\n\nSchool officials are doing their job by looking at things on the internet. \nThey want to make sure the school is a safe place for students. \nThis is what they are supposed to do.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. I think it was a big mistake. I was upset after nine eleven happened. I wanted to help. But now I think we went into the situation unprepared. We did not think about the results. We were angry and wanted revenge. \n\nWe did not think about what would happen next. This caused problems. The people over there were already fighting with each other. We going there did not help. They could not fight with us because they were busy fighting with themselves.\n\nI do not care about what happens over there now. I think they are not very organized. They do not think about making their country better. They just want us to leave. We should leave.\n\nWe went to war without a plan. We did not know what we were doing. We thought we could change their country. But we cannot change people. They will always be the same. We made a mistake by staying in that country.\n\nWe are not making progress. We are just making things worse. If we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should go home."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change some of its views. The Church is losing followers because many people think it is not accepting of some things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong views on these issues, but they may seem old-fashioned to some people.\n\nIf the Church were to change its views and think more like people today, it might not lose followers. Many people disagree with the Church's views and do not want to be a part of it. The Church is against abortion, which can be a problem for people who think abortion is okay. The same is true for gay marriage. If someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family. So why can't priests have both? It is hard to know for sure if the Church would be different if priests could get married or if there were women priests.\n\nI think the Church should be more open to new ideas. It should think about what people want and need. This might help the Church keep its followers.",

But it is not a choice if you are born gay. I was born straight, and my friend was born gay. We did not choose it.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can or cannot get married. Marriage and love are personal things. The government should not judge people's love.\n\nPeople should be free to love whoever they want. We should not punish them for being different. The federal government should not interfere in people's personal lives. They should only worry about the country's security and laws.\n\nI think same-sex marriage is a right.

Many medicines that are not allowed are used in the pharmacy because they have good qualities. We use medicines like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet. These medicines are controlled. They are good and we use them. If we do not allow marijuana because of a bad image, that is not fair.

            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the new century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church service is now thirty minutes long. People dress casually, even in summer when they come straight from the beach. Families arrive late, and some wear jeans and khakis. The atmosphere has become more casual.\n\nAs for other things, this is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know the church's politics and rules.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I do not think these problems could have been stopped. There are married men who become pedophiles, and their attraction to young children is a personal issue, not because of their marriage status.\n\nWhen someone chooses to be a priest, it is their decision. Some religions allow their leaders to be married, but it does not prevent pedophilia. A person's sexuality is based on genetics. It is not something they become due to their upbringing. Genetics are something you are born with. You cannot hide it by getting married.\n\nThe church cannot prevent pedophilia. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they were always aware of these problems.\n\nI have no other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

One of their advisors said that the younger Bush wanted to get revenge against Saddam Hussein because of a problem from the past.\n\nNow, the war has been going on for a long time.

I think we use guns to show our power and to prove we are strong. \n\nI do not think it is fair to call it a war because it was not declared by Congress. We have to declare war to Congress to make it official.\n\nI think it is a good idea to stay in Iraq and help them, but it is also a waste of resources. It is making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war, and it was a waste of time.

            "The war in Iraq was a complicated situation. Some people think the government was not honest with Americans about why the war started. Before the war, the government suggested a connection between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 attacks. However, the two events are not closely related.\n\nThe United States invaded Iraq in 2003. I do not support war. I think the war was a mistake. It is like the Vietnam War. The US government learned from its mistakes in Vietnam, but it did not use this knowledge in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad. The US government took out the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for what happened after that. There was a power vacuum and chaos. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was a difficult process.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be hard to win. It was not a clear victory. We were fighting against the Iraqi people, not a regular army. Many people in Iraq did not want the US to be there. It's hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the US government should not have gone to war. If it did, it should have planned carefully for all possible outcomes. The government was not well prepared for what happened after the Iraqi government was removed. We are still in Iraq and many American soldiers are still dying. The US is trying to train Iraqi soldiers and police, but this takes a long time.\n\nThe US government tried to make the American people believe that the war would be easy and successful. But democracy is not easy to create. It took the US many years to develop its own democratic government. The government should have been honest with the American people about the difficulties of creating a new government in Iraq.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in Iraq. We have been there for a long time, and we cannot just leave now. We took away the Iraqi government and their way of life. But we must also consider the many American soldiers who have died. We should try to finish what we started, but we must think about the cost.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic country. But why did we not do the same thing in other countries? The reason is often oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but these were never found. We did know that North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade that country.\n\nI just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace there.

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. I have always thought this. I believe it is a personal preference. Many scientists now think that a person's sexual preference is not because of their family or society, but because of their biology. I think this is a good reason to give them equal rights.\n\nI do not think the government should say who can get married. Marriage is a personal thing, not something the government should decide. I have friends who are gay but not married. They behave just like any other family. They walk their dogs and live like everyone else.\n\nI do not think it is right for someone like President Bush to tell us what marriage means. I think this is too much power for one person. I have read and heard that some scientists think that being gay is because of a chemical in the brain that is not normal in most people.\n\nI think there are many reasons why people are gay. It is not just because of how they were raised. If two people love each other, they should be able to get married without anyone bothering them.\n\nIt is not fair that gay couples have to get married in secret, like in Las Vegas. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big deal. I think marriage should be a private thing, not something the whole country talks about.",

It could be a test gone wrong, like one we did in school for our sociology class. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nIn our situation, someone overheard someone talking and called the school. We found the person and looked at their Facebook page. They had some things on there that might be funny, but now they are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. If you don't want people to see something, don't put it there. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their personal pages. But if something is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously.\n\nFor example, if a teacher makes a fake account and friends students, that's not right. It's the same as spying. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal pictures or know what they are doing. It's not my job.\n\nThe school must take care of problems they find. But they should not be looking at students' private information.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. The purpose was good at the start. We wanted to help a country with no fair government. But now I am not sure we are doing this for the right reasons. We may be fighting just to show that we are strong.\n\nI think our motives were once good. We wanted to help a country with no freedom. But now I think we are fighting for other things. It started with a good reason, but now I am not sure. It makes me think of the past when we had problems with other leaders, like Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we made our point early on. Starting the war was a strong statement. But it has gone on for many years. I think that is too long. We should have stopped a long time ago.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country with a bad leader, that is a good reason to fight. But I do not think that is why we are fighting now. I think we are fighting just to fight. We want to win, but we do not have a clear victory.\n\nI think it is time to stop the war. The country we are fighting for will soon have to take care of itself. We should be spending our money on our own problems, like poverty and poor schools. We have many problems that need our help.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. This money could be used for better things, like building roads or helping people get health care. We should be using our money to improve our own country, not to fight a war that we are not winning.\n\nI think that is all I want to say about this.",
            "I have a question. It is about online privacy. On the internet, it is easy to see information that people put on websites like Myspace. If you post something on the internet, it is likely that many people will see it.\n\nMyspace is a website where you can list your friends. You need to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you add someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put something on the internet, you should understand that many people will see it.\n\nIt is hard to have someone check all students' online profiles to prevent problems. But if someone finds something bad by accident, is that good or bad? It depends on the situation. If someone is looking for something bad, it is not good. But if they just happened to see it by chance, it might be good that they did.\n\nI have a Facebook account. It bothers me that people can see things about me. There was a TV show about a man who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. I wouldn't meet someone like that.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information online. You put your class schedule and photos, and people can know a lot about you. I limit what I put on my Facebook, but I also want to be able to talk to my friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned Myspace. I am not sure if that was right. I don't know if they had the power to tell students they couldn't have Myspace.",
            "I have thoughts about the war in Iraq. I want to talk about it. But I feel strange saying it now. Many people already said they were against the war from the start. I also said I was against it. However, I think it's not as important now.\n\nI looked at many polls. People from the United States, Iraq, and all over the world said the war was a bad idea. More than 75% of the world's population thinks so. Most Iraqis, American soldiers, and even people from the United States agree with them.\n\nThe war started as a bad situation. It became worse. Now, pulling out is a difficult problem. The US and the Middle East have big cultural differences. It's hard to understand each other.\n\nThe US government thought they could bring democracy to Iraq easily. But Iraqis want to make their own decisions. They don't want democracy forced on them. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but that's no reason to go to war.\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the advantages and disadvantages. We should not invade a country and make it a disaster. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The Iraqi people want us to leave. They even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know better.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help them later, we can be seen as the good guys. But, unfortunately, it's hard to be the good guys in the Middle East.",
            "I think the United States still has a problem with gender discrimination. This problem exists in many areas, but it is worse in some jobs than others. The issue is not just with women. Men can also face discrimination in certain jobs.\n\nFor example, some men have trouble getting promoted to higher positions because they work for women. This is because society has always seen men as the leaders. As a result, people have a hard time accepting men working for women.\n\nIn other areas like fashion, men who like fashion are often looked down upon. People think it's not a typical job for men. And if a man is a stay-at-home parent, society sees it as strange. They think he should be working and bringing home the money.\n\nIn some industries, people don't take men seriously if they are into fashion. They think that men who like fashion are different. This can make it hard for men to succeed in these jobs.\n\nGender discrimination is a problem in the United States. It will take a lot of time to change. But we can see some progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in the business world. More men are staying home to raise their children, and people are starting to see this as a good thing.\n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different. We should not force people to accept these qualities, but instead, let them see the good things about these people. If we do this slowly, people will start to accept them.\n\nIt's not just about men and women. People from different places and with different backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm who doesn't have perfect grammar can still be a great leader. But other people might look down on him because of his grammar.\n\nIn conclusion, the United States still has a problem with gender and social discrimination. But we can make progress if we do things slowly and promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a criminal offense. This means people who use it will get a ticket, not arrested. This is a good idea because it saves money for the government. They do not have to pay for court cases and jails. In a place like Denver, where people are open-minded, this is a good idea. The city can use the saved money for important things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some people are concerned about the effects of marijuana. They think it should not be everywhere. Some people worry that if it is legalized, people will smoke it and drive, which is not safe. Many people still do not like the idea of smoking marijuana in public.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana both have bad effects. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can affect how people live their lives. But people react differently to these substances. Some people can use them and be fine, while others have problems.\n\nIt is hard to say how people will react to marijuana because everyone is different. But one thing is true: both alcohol and marijuana have bad effects.",
            "I agree with you. Here's why: Many things they do are traditional. They have done them for a long time. This is good. It's also important to change and adapt. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, they look down on people who do not follow their rules. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents were not married in a Catholic church. My mom was a Catholic, and my dad was not. This was not because of my dad's religion, but because the church did not accept him.\n\nCatholic teaching says to love others. But some Catholic practices go against this teaching. This is because they are out of date. They continue to follow these practices anyway.\n\nI do not think this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could marry. But I do not think this would stop them from hurting children. It is a different situation. They would probably still do bad things.\n\nSome people who hurt children will do it no matter what. They will do it because they are hurting a child, not a partner. If they want to do something bad, they will do it. Getting married or not will not stop them.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop these bad things from happening. They would probably still happen.",
            "I am not sure about this problem. I do not have enough information to say who is right or wrong. This is a difficult issue. \n\nIt is about the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage. It is hard to do this without hurting anyone's feelings. I think civil unions are a good idea. But I do not know if marriage should be a civil union.\n\nMarriage is a very important thing. It is when two people join together. The government should not care about the type of marriage. It should just be a union of two people. \n\nSome people want to get married because of their church. But the government should not care about this. It is not fair to say some people can get married and others cannot.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is similar. Two people who love each other should be able to join together. I do not think it is right to say no to this.\n\nIf many states agree on this, they should try to make it a law for the whole country. But making a change to the constitution to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution. It should only be changed for very big reasons. \n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This is why I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have many gay friends, and I think being gay is a personal choice. However, I do not agree with this lifestyle. I do think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national issue. Instead, I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some states are more democratic and some are more republican. Democratic states will probably support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you probably know how the people feel about gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there, so you should be willing to accept the laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I believe each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage. This way, each state can make its own choice.\n\nI already said that I believe each state should decide. I do not think the president should make a decision for the whole country. President Bush wants to ban gay marriage nationwide. I disagree with this. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president does not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state runs itself. He will be out of office soon, and a new president may change the law. This decision should be left to each state, so it is clear what the people want.\n\nNo, I do not want a national ban on gay marriage.",
            "I don't agree with school officials looking at what students post on the internet. \nHowever, if they are searching for things that might make the school safer, that's okay. \nIf school officials want to know if students are doing something bad, they can find it on the internet, even if it's not on the school's website. \nSo, it's not really private.\n\nWhen people post things on the internet, they have to know that others will see them. \nThis includes school officials. \nIf school officials find something that might make the school safer, they can use that information. \n\nSchools have a job to keep students safe. \nThey can look at things on the internet to do this. \nFor example, they might want to know if students are drinking or smoking. \nIf they find out about this, they can get the students in trouble.\n\nSome people might think it's an invasion of privacy for school officials to look at things on the internet. \nHowever, if it makes the school safer, it's okay. \nSchool officials are just trying to keep students safe.\n\nWhen students post things on the internet, they should be careful. \nIt's easy to get in trouble if something they post is not good. \nIt's like writing a letter that someone else can read. \nIf you post something on the internet, it will stay there forever. \n\nSchool officials looked at things on the internet to keep the school safe. \nThey wanted to make sure nothing bad would happen, like a school shooting. \nThis is like practicing for emergencies. \nThey want to be ready to keep students safe.\n\nSchool officials are doing their job by looking at things on the internet. \nThey want to make sure the school is a safe place for students. \nThis is what they are supposed to do.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. I think it was a big mistake. I was upset after nine eleven happened. I wanted to help. But now I think we went into the situation unprepared. We did not think about the results. We were angry and wanted revenge. \n\nWe did not think about what would happen next. This caused problems. The people over there were already fighting with each other. We going there did not help. They could not fight with us because they were busy fighting with themselves.\n\nI do not care about what happens over there now. I think they are not very organized. They do not think about making their country better. They just want us to leave. We should leave.\n\nWe went to war without a plan. We did not know what we were doing. We thought we could change their country. But we cannot change people. They will always be the same. We made a mistake by staying in that country.\n\nWe are not making progress. We are just making things worse. If we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should go home."
