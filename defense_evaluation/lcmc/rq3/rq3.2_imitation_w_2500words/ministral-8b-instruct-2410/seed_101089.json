            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. They have been grappling with a decline in followers, and I believe this is due to their lack of acceptance on numerous issues. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control can be quite rigid. I think if they were to evolve their thinking a bit, they might not face such a loss in their following.\n\nI've heard that many are starting to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these topics. People are no longer aligned with their stances on these issues, which is causing them to feel uncomfortable within the church. For example, if you support abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if you're for gay marriage, you might struggle in a following that doesn't agree with it.\n\nI don't understand why the Catholic Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. The church claims that priests are married to God, yet everyone else in the world has both a job and a family life. I'm not sure why priests can't have both as well.",
            "In my opinion, I’m not against gay marriage. I honestly don’t see it as a conscious choice that gay people make. It just seems like they are born that way, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. I don’t think it’s right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can’t. I haven’t given it much thought, but I would definitely say that’s wrong. It’s not like they have a say in how they are born. I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this. It’s not a legal or moral issue, and I don’t think they have a right to interfere in people’s lives. It’s just who they are, and they shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s all.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, and here’s why. There's really no solid reason to oppose it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's actually quite different. It’s like comparing two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, yet it's essentially the same thing. Let’s talk about the practical aspects. Many civil rights are tied to marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in a hospital or visit you because they're not technically family. That seems silly if you're spending your life with someone. Plus, scientific studies show that homosexual couples have the same relationship success rates and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main issue is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to marry in a church, they just want a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no religious involvement, it shouldn't be an issue. Some people, like Catholics, argue that it’s against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It’s like segregation: separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, like relationship roles played by partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, but again, the main concern is how children are treated. In New York City, for instance, children of gay parents have special schools because they face bullying in public schools. But parenting skills don't differ between gay and straight couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should be changed to reflect that.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, largely based on his religion, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of his reasons are moral, which vary from person to person. It’s unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It’s hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on an entire country, considering the recent controversy over \"under God” in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged. But the American Psychological Association says this is untrue. If we listened to institutions that do research and studies, society might see things differently.",
            "Let me start by sharing my experience working as a pharmacy intern over the summer. Now, it's important to note that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. I strongly believe that while we should not make it widely available to the public just yet, utilizing it for medicinal purposes is a different story. For instance, there are controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin that are often used in a clinical setting because they provide genuine benefits. Denying these benefits just because of marijuana's taboo status is not productive in my opinion.\n\nI must also emphasize that while marijuana and alcohol are both subject to abuse, marijuana is generally considered less harmful. Integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could be a viable solution. First, we should remove the stigma associated with marijuana to encourage responsible use. If we can achieve this, people might be better equipped to use marijuana responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, I contend that the benefits of marijuana should not be dismissed solely based on its illegal status. By embracing its medicinal properties and addressing the taboo surrounding it, we can pave the way for a more responsible and regulated future for marijuana.",
            "I believe the church has made adjustments to adapt to the twenty-first century. It isn't as rigid as it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends, but now, as I've aged, they've introduced a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer when you'll see folks in beach clothes, and families often arrive late. Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. The church I know has also seen a shift in its political landscape, but I'm not privy to the intricacies. Overall, I think it has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Married men can still become pedophiles due to their genetics, and it's not always a lifestyle choice. Many religions allow their clergy to marry, but if a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I believe pedophilia is primarily genetic rather than environmental, and marriage wouldn't change that. If the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, it's shameful, but I believe in many cases, they may not have been aware. I have no other significant thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but as we were still recovering from the September 11th attacks, everyone was quite shaken. The Bush administration used various pretexts to justify going into Iraq, claiming connections to Osama Bin Laden and linking the war to the attacks. They also alleged that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know were never proven true. This really grates on me, and the Iraq war has always made my blood boil.\n\nI believe the Bush administration straightforwardly lied to the American people and has not taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who gave a major presentation at the UN, later admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. They have shown complete disregard for the Constitution and have been trying to undermine it ever since, especially since September 11th. I think they entered office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t recall the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made this allegation in his book after being forced out, but it seems like the younger Bush was driven by a sense of blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. He also had long-term plans to expand our energy supply, which was quite underhanded. However, I believe the situation has dragged on long enough.\n\nIf we withdraw now, there’s a high risk of civil war and even more deaths. The alternative being considered by the UN and the US is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. However, I'm not sure this is a good idea in the long term because it will bring up issues of Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, as the news reports suggest the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister seems to lack control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting against less than a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in the Iraqi Parliament. The political process is quite tumultuous due to these radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this can be articulated in polite company.",
            "I guess I don't really know how I feel about the War in Iraq. I mean, it's like, what's the point? It wasn't even declared a war. It's more like a big get-back-at-Iraq thing, right? I mean, who do we think did 9/11? So, I don't really follow the details of it, but I know we're kind of just over there trying to build democracy and get oil. But it's not making anyone happy, and if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up again. It's so confusing! I mean, it's like, why are we still there? I don't know! I'm not really for the war, but I don't know if I'm against it either. It's hard to say. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it doesn't feel like one. We just have all these big guns and stuff to show we're powerful. But I don't think it's fair. It's like the Vietnam War, it was never declared, and now it's called a meaningless war. And I don't want Bush to be remembered as the worst president ever. It's just so unfair. And there are so many families with kids in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. But if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into something they're not. And that could make things worse. I mean, who knows what's going to happen in the end? It's just so hard to say. I guess it's going to go on for years.",
            "I strongly feel it's not appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to even consider it. I believe it's a matter that should be left to the churches, as the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any regulations over it would be a breach of what's already established in the constitution. I find it hypocritical for those who are pushing for its illegality to impose their beliefs on others, particularly when most Catholics and Christians oppose it. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of our constitution, promoting religious tolerance. I don't see why making an amendment about this issue would be necessary or beneficial, as it would only restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this at all. The president's push for this amendment is clearly driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it's not justified by any logical or economic reasons. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece on this topic.",
            "Ok, let's talk about the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to get started, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, they had very little to do with each other. The government used the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the terrorist attacks, to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nNow, I'm generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the government should have learned from the Vietnam War. The Iraq War was, in many ways, similar to Vietnam. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic government, just like they did in Vietnam. But they were not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and more importantly, they were not prepared for the insurgents who fought against them.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes. The war in Iraq has been going on for years, and many American troops have died. The U.S. is still there today, trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I don't think the government was prepared for it.\n\nThe U.S. government also made it seem like the invasion would be a short, successful mission, which was naïve. It's not an easy thing to implement a new form of government, especially after a long war. It took our own country a long time to become the powerful democracy it is today, with a lot of tension and civil war along the way.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to let him finish what he started, because it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping. But at the same time, we need to consider the staggering number of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the main reason is oil. The U.S. is getting its oil from Iraq, and it's usually all about money and controlling resources. Before the invasion, there were claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Yet, places like North Korea, which we know have these weapons, are not being attacked. I don't think the U.S. government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's been proven to have biological roots rather than sociological ones. This means that denying people the right to marry someone they love based on something they can't control is inhumane. I've always advocated for gay marriage and I believe that politics and government should stay out of people's personal lives. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who don't have the same rights as straight couples, but they function just like any other family. I think it's ridiculous for politicians to try and interpret marriage in a way that suits them. It's a personal matter, not a national or federal concern. I've heard from many sources that being homosexual can be influenced by biology, not upbringing. For example, a chemical reaction in the brain might predispose someone to be homosexual, rather than societal factors. It's unfair that two people can get married in secret without anyone knowing, but two gay people wanting to do the same gets front-page news. I believe marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal, and now it appears we're simply continuing the conflict to assert our status as a global superpower. Perhaps there were personal interests at play, like the previous feud between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While spreading democracy was a valid motivation, any hint of personal gain would have been unfair. I believe our initial goal was achieved in the first few months, as the war's start itself was a significant statement. Still, the prolonged conflict has left the original purpose diluted and misconceived, as it seems we're still at war for the sake of being at war, aiming for a decisive end that may never come.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on far too long. If our main objective was to install democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a just cause. However, I don't think our reasons have stayed true to this original intent. It seems we're still waging war just to wage war, without a clear end goal in sight. It's high time we let the local government take the reins and step back, as they will eventually have to handle their own affairs anyway. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, which could be better spent addressing our own pressing issues like poverty and infrastructure. It's a drain on our economy to keep funding a war that has lost its purpose over time.",
            "I wanted to clarify something. It seems that the situation you're referring to was prevented because someone went online and found some information. Anyway, I think it's okay. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much accessible to everyone. You have to understand that when you give someone access to your profile, you're allowing them to see it. So, if someone spotted something and prevented a situation, that's not an invasion of privacy. However, it might be difficult to monitor every profile to ensure safety, but it becomes discriminatory if they only target the \"bad kids.\" It depends on the context—whether they were actively searching for something specific or just stumbled upon it. I don't know, it's a tricky issue. I use Facebook, and I'm always aware that there are creepy people out there. I saw a TV show where a man easily found someone's information and convinced her to meet him. It's scary. Sometimes, people I don't recognize on my class list IM me, and I wonder if they know too much about me. It's a dangerous game balancing privacy and communication. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can see what. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seems a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or if they had the right to do that. It's a complex situation.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it\nNot only with women though\nI feel it has to do with the specific field of work that you’re engaged in\nUm\nI mean, for the most part, I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s this glass ceiling where, even though there’s supposed to be equality, many people struggle to work under a woman if they are a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, a lot of times in the workplace, women might see a job they’re qualified for\nBut the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd um\nI guess the same goes for men too\nAnd like other industries like fashion or\nUm being a parent at home\nIt’s really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male\nAnd um\nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you’re the male, you should be out working\nYou should be the money maker of your family\nWhy are you staying at home?\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them and maybe the wife has the better job\nAnd like it’s working out fine for them\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd then in the fashion industry\nUm\nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight\nI don’t know if that really makes sense\nBut I guess it’s because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nLike I guess have different lifestyles\nAnd so if you have the typical lifestyle and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry\nPeople will be like, well wait, how do I really know if you know anything about fashion if you’re a woman?\nLike you don’t really know what our case is like\nLike these other guys\nAnd so\nDepending on the field of work you’re in\nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds\nBut change is really slow so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process\nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works\nAnd um\nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nAnd so they do know what I’m talking about\nSo I guess you kind of have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, by not being too pushy\nBut um saying like the qualities of them\nBecause if you force it, people are going to resist\nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist\nAnd we’ve come a long way and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go on to become a CEO\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don’t know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "I understand that they didn’t outright legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means that getting caught with it is treated more like getting a traffic ticket than a criminal offense. While a decriminalized charge can still have serious future ramifications, such as making it difficult to pass a job interview, it does reduce the immediate consequences of being arrested and booked. On the other hand, there are costs involved in arresting, housing, and bringing individuals to court, especially in financially struggling communities. In a place like Denver, where the community tends to be more open-minded and liberal, decriminalizing marijuana might be a good decision. This could potentially free up funds for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. However, it's important to consider that widespread legalization could lead to marijuana being sold in gas stations and smoked in public, which might not be desirable. Additionally, while alcohol may have more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more enduring impact on an individual's lifestyle. I don't think that either substance should be generalized, as people react differently based on their personalities and behaviors.",
            "In my opinion, yes, there are some things that the Catholic Church has done traditionally that are quite old-fashioned. They've maintained these customs for long periods, which is good for grounding and maintaining traditions. However, it's also crucial to be open-minded to change. Many Catholics feel that they must attend Church weekly and adhere strictly to the Church's rules. This strictness sometimes makes it seem like the Church doesn't accept those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or aren't Catholic. For instance, my parents faced difficulties when it came to getting married in the Church because my father was an Episcopalian. This isn't really tolerant of other religions, which goes against the Church's teachings on loving others. I believe many Catholic doctrines tell us what to do, but the Church's practices don't always align with these teachings due to their outdated nature. I think it's a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't believe it would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. I think priests would act that way whether they're married or not, as the act involves children, not spouses. Therefore, I don't think allowing priests to marry would deter them from these behaviors. In my view, it wouldn't make a difference.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't declare one side as right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most complex topics we're dealing with today. The debate lies between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage, which is tricky without offending anyone. I think civil unions, regardless of the ceremony's religious context, should be treated equally by the government. After all, they're unions between two people, and the government shouldn't concern itself with the type of ceremony or religious significance. But if states can come to a logical consensus, they should push for federal recognition of civil unions. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd; it's not a cause large enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's simply not that important to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "You know, I was brought up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I've got a lot of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each state. I mean, there are so many democratic and republican states, and you can't deny that democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you're choosing to live there, so you should accept that state's position on the issue. I believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think the decision should be up to each state.\n\nI also think Bush shouldn't have a say in whether or not the whole country should be against gay marriage. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't dictate how each state wants to run. Plus, he'll be out of office soon enough, so it doesn't matter what he decides. I think some things are better left up to the individual states, as they'll be the ones to live with the decision. Let's just leave it at that.",
            "So, no, I don't think they should do that at all. Let me explain why. Myspace, it's a public platform, right? If you look at the definition, it's basically for people to see whatever you post. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it. It could be school officials or anyone else. They might see something you didn't intend for them to see. But, if something on the internet could potentially prevent a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. It's the school officials' responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and this might help them do just that. Now, if they're just using the internet to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it for the greater good, to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all. I mean, if you're a student posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's crazy. Everything you post on the internet is for the world to see, and it can come back to bite you later. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. And if they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place, then it's fine. But if they're just doing it to catch students, that's not good. It's like they're dropping their kids off at school and expecting it to be a safe place, and the school officials are doing their duty to ensure that. That's why they do drills and practice for emergencies. They're just trying to make the school safer and prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's all I have to say.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. They have been grappling with a decline in followers, and I believe this is due to their lack of acceptance on numerous issues. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control can be quite rigid. I think if they were to evolve their thinking a bit, they might not face such a loss in their following.\n\nI've heard that many are starting to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these topics. People are no longer aligned with their stances on these issues, which is causing them to feel uncomfortable within the church. For example, if you support abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if you're for gay marriage, you might struggle in a following that doesn't agree with it.\n\nI don't understand why the Catholic Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. The church claims that priests are married to God, yet everyone else in the world has both a job and a family life. I'm not sure why priests can't have both as well.",
            "In my opinion, I’m not against gay marriage. I honestly don’t see it as a conscious choice that gay people make. It just seems like they are born that way, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. I don’t think it’s right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can’t. I haven’t given it much thought, but I would definitely say that’s wrong. It’s not like they have a say in how they are born. I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this. It’s not a legal or moral issue, and I don’t think they have a right to interfere in people’s lives. It’s just who they are, and they shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s all.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, and here’s why. There's really no solid reason to oppose it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's actually quite different. It’s like comparing two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, yet it's essentially the same thing. Let’s talk about the practical aspects. Many civil rights are tied to marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in a hospital or visit you because they're not technically family. That seems silly if you're spending your life with someone. Plus, scientific studies show that homosexual couples have the same relationship success rates and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main issue is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to marry in a church, they just want a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no religious involvement, it shouldn't be an issue. Some people, like Catholics, argue that it’s against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It’s like segregation: separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, like relationship roles played by partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, but again, the main concern is how children are treated. In New York City, for instance, children of gay parents have special schools because they face bullying in public schools. But parenting skills don't differ between gay and straight couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should be changed to reflect that.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, largely based on his religion, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of his reasons are moral, which vary from person to person. It’s unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It’s hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on an entire country, considering the recent controversy over \"under God” in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged. But the American Psychological Association says this is untrue. If we listened to institutions that do research and studies, society might see things differently.",
            "Let me start by sharing my experience working as a pharmacy intern over the summer. Now, it's important to note that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. I strongly believe that while we should not make it widely available to the public just yet, utilizing it for medicinal purposes is a different story. For instance, there are controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin that are often used in a clinical setting because they provide genuine benefits. Denying these benefits just because of marijuana's taboo status is not productive in my opinion.\n\nI must also emphasize that while marijuana and alcohol are both subject to abuse, marijuana is generally considered less harmful. Integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could be a viable solution. First, we should remove the stigma associated with marijuana to encourage responsible use. If we can achieve this, people might be better equipped to use marijuana responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, I contend that the benefits of marijuana should not be dismissed solely based on its illegal status. By embracing its medicinal properties and addressing the taboo surrounding it, we can pave the way for a more responsible and regulated future for marijuana.",
            "I believe the church has made adjustments to adapt to the twenty-first century. It isn't as rigid as it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends, but now, as I've aged, they've introduced a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer when you'll see folks in beach clothes, and families often arrive late. Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. The church I know has also seen a shift in its political landscape, but I'm not privy to the intricacies. Overall, I think it has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Married men can still become pedophiles due to their genetics, and it's not always a lifestyle choice. Many religions allow their clergy to marry, but if a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I believe pedophilia is primarily genetic rather than environmental, and marriage wouldn't change that. If the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, it's shameful, but I believe in many cases, they may not have been aware. I have no other significant thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but as we were still recovering from the September 11th attacks, everyone was quite shaken. The Bush administration used various pretexts to justify going into Iraq, claiming connections to Osama Bin Laden and linking the war to the attacks. They also alleged that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know were never proven true. This really grates on me, and the Iraq war has always made my blood boil.\n\nI believe the Bush administration straightforwardly lied to the American people and has not taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who gave a major presentation at the UN, later admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. They have shown complete disregard for the Constitution and have been trying to undermine it ever since, especially since September 11th. I think they entered office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t recall the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made this allegation in his book after being forced out, but it seems like the younger Bush was driven by a sense of blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. He also had long-term plans to expand our energy supply, which was quite underhanded. However, I believe the situation has dragged on long enough.\n\nIf we withdraw now, there’s a high risk of civil war and even more deaths. The alternative being considered by the UN and the US is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. However, I'm not sure this is a good idea in the long term because it will bring up issues of Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, as the news reports suggest the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister seems to lack control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting against less than a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in the Iraqi Parliament. The political process is quite tumultuous due to these radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this can be articulated in polite company.",
            "I guess I don't really know how I feel about the War in Iraq. I mean, it's like, what's the point? It wasn't even declared a war. It's more like a big get-back-at-Iraq thing, right? I mean, who do we think did 9/11? So, I don't really follow the details of it, but I know we're kind of just over there trying to build democracy and get oil. But it's not making anyone happy, and if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up again. It's so confusing! I mean, it's like, why are we still there? I don't know! I'm not really for the war, but I don't know if I'm against it either. It's hard to say. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it doesn't feel like one. We just have all these big guns and stuff to show we're powerful. But I don't think it's fair. It's like the Vietnam War, it was never declared, and now it's called a meaningless war. And I don't want Bush to be remembered as the worst president ever. It's just so unfair. And there are so many families with kids in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. But if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into something they're not. And that could make things worse. I mean, who knows what's going to happen in the end? It's just so hard to say. I guess it's going to go on for years.",
            "I strongly feel it's not appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to even consider it. I believe it's a matter that should be left to the churches, as the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any regulations over it would be a breach of what's already established in the constitution. I find it hypocritical for those who are pushing for its illegality to impose their beliefs on others, particularly when most Catholics and Christians oppose it. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of our constitution, promoting religious tolerance. I don't see why making an amendment about this issue would be necessary or beneficial, as it would only restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this at all. The president's push for this amendment is clearly driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it's not justified by any logical or economic reasons. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece on this topic.",
            "Ok, let's talk about the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to get started, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, they had very little to do with each other. The government used the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the terrorist attacks, to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nNow, I'm generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the government should have learned from the Vietnam War. The Iraq War was, in many ways, similar to Vietnam. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic government, just like they did in Vietnam. But they were not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and more importantly, they were not prepared for the insurgents who fought against them.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes. The war in Iraq has been going on for years, and many American troops have died. The U.S. is still there today, trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I don't think the government was prepared for it.\n\nThe U.S. government also made it seem like the invasion would be a short, successful mission, which was naïve. It's not an easy thing to implement a new form of government, especially after a long war. It took our own country a long time to become the powerful democracy it is today, with a lot of tension and civil war along the way.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to let him finish what he started, because it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping. But at the same time, we need to consider the staggering number of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the main reason is oil. The U.S. is getting its oil from Iraq, and it's usually all about money and controlling resources. Before the invasion, there were claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Yet, places like North Korea, which we know have these weapons, are not being attacked. I don't think the U.S. government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's been proven to have biological roots rather than sociological ones. This means that denying people the right to marry someone they love based on something they can't control is inhumane. I've always advocated for gay marriage and I believe that politics and government should stay out of people's personal lives. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who don't have the same rights as straight couples, but they function just like any other family. I think it's ridiculous for politicians to try and interpret marriage in a way that suits them. It's a personal matter, not a national or federal concern. I've heard from many sources that being homosexual can be influenced by biology, not upbringing. For example, a chemical reaction in the brain might predispose someone to be homosexual, rather than societal factors. It's unfair that two people can get married in secret without anyone knowing, but two gay people wanting to do the same gets front-page news. I believe marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal, and now it appears we're simply continuing the conflict to assert our status as a global superpower. Perhaps there were personal interests at play, like the previous feud between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While spreading democracy was a valid motivation, any hint of personal gain would have been unfair. I believe our initial goal was achieved in the first few months, as the war's start itself was a significant statement. Still, the prolonged conflict has left the original purpose diluted and misconceived, as it seems we're still at war for the sake of being at war, aiming for a decisive end that may never come.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on far too long. If our main objective was to install democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a just cause. However, I don't think our reasons have stayed true to this original intent. It seems we're still waging war just to wage war, without a clear end goal in sight. It's high time we let the local government take the reins and step back, as they will eventually have to handle their own affairs anyway. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, which could be better spent addressing our own pressing issues like poverty and infrastructure. It's a drain on our economy to keep funding a war that has lost its purpose over time.",
            "I wanted to clarify something. It seems that the situation you're referring to was prevented because someone went online and found some information. Anyway, I think it's okay. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much accessible to everyone. You have to understand that when you give someone access to your profile, you're allowing them to see it. So, if someone spotted something and prevented a situation, that's not an invasion of privacy. However, it might be difficult to monitor every profile to ensure safety, but it becomes discriminatory if they only target the \"bad kids.\" It depends on the context—whether they were actively searching for something specific or just stumbled upon it. I don't know, it's a tricky issue. I use Facebook, and I'm always aware that there are creepy people out there. I saw a TV show where a man easily found someone's information and convinced her to meet him. It's scary. Sometimes, people I don't recognize on my class list IM me, and I wonder if they know too much about me. It's a dangerous game balancing privacy and communication. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can see what. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seems a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or if they had the right to do that. It's a complex situation.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it\nNot only with women though\nI feel it has to do with the specific field of work that you’re engaged in\nUm\nI mean, for the most part, I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s this glass ceiling where, even though there’s supposed to be equality, many people struggle to work under a woman if they are a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, a lot of times in the workplace, women might see a job they’re qualified for\nBut the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd um\nI guess the same goes for men too\nAnd like other industries like fashion or\nUm being a parent at home\nIt’s really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male\nAnd um\nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you’re the male, you should be out working\nYou should be the money maker of your family\nWhy are you staying at home?\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them and maybe the wife has the better job\nAnd like it’s working out fine for them\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd then in the fashion industry\nUm\nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight\nI don’t know if that really makes sense\nBut I guess it’s because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nLike I guess have different lifestyles\nAnd so if you have the typical lifestyle and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry\nPeople will be like, well wait, how do I really know if you know anything about fashion if you’re a woman?\nLike you don’t really know what our case is like\nLike these other guys\nAnd so\nDepending on the field of work you’re in\nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds\nBut change is really slow so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process\nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works\nAnd um\nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nAnd so they do know what I’m talking about\nSo I guess you kind of have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, by not being too pushy\nBut um saying like the qualities of them\nBecause if you force it, people are going to resist\nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist\nAnd we’ve come a long way and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go on to become a CEO\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don’t know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "I understand that they didn’t outright legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means that getting caught with it is treated more like getting a traffic ticket than a criminal offense. While a decriminalized charge can still have serious future ramifications, such as making it difficult to pass a job interview, it does reduce the immediate consequences of being arrested and booked. On the other hand, there are costs involved in arresting, housing, and bringing individuals to court, especially in financially struggling communities. In a place like Denver, where the community tends to be more open-minded and liberal, decriminalizing marijuana might be a good decision. This could potentially free up funds for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. However, it's important to consider that widespread legalization could lead to marijuana being sold in gas stations and smoked in public, which might not be desirable. Additionally, while alcohol may have more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more enduring impact on an individual's lifestyle. I don't think that either substance should be generalized, as people react differently based on their personalities and behaviors.",
            "In my opinion, yes, there are some things that the Catholic Church has done traditionally that are quite old-fashioned. They've maintained these customs for long periods, which is good for grounding and maintaining traditions. However, it's also crucial to be open-minded to change. Many Catholics feel that they must attend Church weekly and adhere strictly to the Church's rules. This strictness sometimes makes it seem like the Church doesn't accept those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or aren't Catholic. For instance, my parents faced difficulties when it came to getting married in the Church because my father was an Episcopalian. This isn't really tolerant of other religions, which goes against the Church's teachings on loving others. I believe many Catholic doctrines tell us what to do, but the Church's practices don't always align with these teachings due to their outdated nature. I think it's a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't believe it would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. I think priests would act that way whether they're married or not, as the act involves children, not spouses. Therefore, I don't think allowing priests to marry would deter them from these behaviors. In my view, it wouldn't make a difference.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't declare one side as right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most complex topics we're dealing with today. The debate lies between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage, which is tricky without offending anyone. I think civil unions, regardless of the ceremony's religious context, should be treated equally by the government. After all, they're unions between two people, and the government shouldn't concern itself with the type of ceremony or religious significance. But if states can come to a logical consensus, they should push for federal recognition of civil unions. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd; it's not a cause large enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's simply not that important to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "You know, I was brought up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I've got a lot of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each state. I mean, there are so many democratic and republican states, and you can't deny that democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you're choosing to live there, so you should accept that state's position on the issue. I believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think the decision should be up to each state.\n\nI also think Bush shouldn't have a say in whether or not the whole country should be against gay marriage. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't dictate how each state wants to run. Plus, he'll be out of office soon enough, so it doesn't matter what he decides. I think some things are better left up to the individual states, as they'll be the ones to live with the decision. Let's just leave it at that.",
            "So, no, I don't think they should do that at all. Let me explain why. Myspace, it's a public platform, right? If you look at the definition, it's basically for people to see whatever you post. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it. It could be school officials or anyone else. They might see something you didn't intend for them to see. But, if something on the internet could potentially prevent a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. It's the school officials' responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and this might help them do just that. Now, if they're just using the internet to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it for the greater good, to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all. I mean, if you're a student posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's crazy. Everything you post on the internet is for the world to see, and it can come back to bite you later. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. And if they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place, then it's fine. But if they're just doing it to catch students, that's not good. It's like they're dropping their kids off at school and expecting it to be a safe place, and the school officials are doing their duty to ensure that. That's why they do drills and practice for emergencies. They're just trying to make the school safer and prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's all I have to say.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. They have been grappling with a decline in followers, and I believe this is due to their lack of acceptance on numerous issues. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control can be quite rigid. I think if they were to evolve their thinking a bit, they might not face such a loss in their following.\n\nI've heard that many are starting to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these topics. People are no longer aligned with their stances on these issues, which is causing them to feel uncomfortable within the church. For example, if you support abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if you're for gay marriage, you might struggle in a following that doesn't agree with it.\n\nI don't understand why the Catholic Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. The church claims that priests are married to God, yet everyone else in the world has both a job and a family life. I'm not sure why priests can't have both as well.",
            "In my opinion, I’m not against gay marriage. I honestly don’t see it as a conscious choice that gay people make. It just seems like they are born that way, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. I don’t think it’s right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can’t. I haven’t given it much thought, but I would definitely say that’s wrong. It’s not like they have a say in how they are born. I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this. It’s not a legal or moral issue, and I don’t think they have a right to interfere in people’s lives. It’s just who they are, and they shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s all.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, and here’s why. There's really no solid reason to oppose it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's actually quite different. It’s like comparing two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, yet it's essentially the same thing. Let’s talk about the practical aspects. Many civil rights are tied to marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in a hospital or visit you because they're not technically family. That seems silly if you're spending your life with someone. Plus, scientific studies show that homosexual couples have the same relationship success rates and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main issue is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to marry in a church, they just want a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no religious involvement, it shouldn't be an issue. Some people, like Catholics, argue that it’s against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It’s like segregation: separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, like relationship roles played by partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, but again, the main concern is how children are treated. In New York City, for instance, children of gay parents have special schools because they face bullying in public schools. But parenting skills don't differ between gay and straight couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should be changed to reflect that.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, largely based on his religion, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of his reasons are moral, which vary from person to person. It’s unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It’s hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on an entire country, considering the recent controversy over \"under God” in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged. But the American Psychological Association says this is untrue. If we listened to institutions that do research and studies, society might see things differently.",
            "Let me start by sharing my experience working as a pharmacy intern over the summer. Now, it's important to note that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. I strongly believe that while we should not make it widely available to the public just yet, utilizing it for medicinal purposes is a different story. For instance, there are controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin that are often used in a clinical setting because they provide genuine benefits. Denying these benefits just because of marijuana's taboo status is not productive in my opinion.\n\nI must also emphasize that while marijuana and alcohol are both subject to abuse, marijuana is generally considered less harmful. Integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could be a viable solution. First, we should remove the stigma associated with marijuana to encourage responsible use. If we can achieve this, people might be better equipped to use marijuana responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, I contend that the benefits of marijuana should not be dismissed solely based on its illegal status. By embracing its medicinal properties and addressing the taboo surrounding it, we can pave the way for a more responsible and regulated future for marijuana.",
            "I believe the church has made adjustments to adapt to the twenty-first century. It isn't as rigid as it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends, but now, as I've aged, they've introduced a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer when you'll see folks in beach clothes, and families often arrive late. Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. The church I know has also seen a shift in its political landscape, but I'm not privy to the intricacies. Overall, I think it has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Married men can still become pedophiles due to their genetics, and it's not always a lifestyle choice. Many religions allow their clergy to marry, but if a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I believe pedophilia is primarily genetic rather than environmental, and marriage wouldn't change that. If the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, it's shameful, but I believe in many cases, they may not have been aware. I have no other significant thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but as we were still recovering from the September 11th attacks, everyone was quite shaken. The Bush administration used various pretexts to justify going into Iraq, claiming connections to Osama Bin Laden and linking the war to the attacks. They also alleged that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know were never proven true. This really grates on me, and the Iraq war has always made my blood boil.\n\nI believe the Bush administration straightforwardly lied to the American people and has not taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who gave a major presentation at the UN, later admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. They have shown complete disregard for the Constitution and have been trying to undermine it ever since, especially since September 11th. I think they entered office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t recall the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made this allegation in his book after being forced out, but it seems like the younger Bush was driven by a sense of blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. He also had long-term plans to expand our energy supply, which was quite underhanded. However, I believe the situation has dragged on long enough.\n\nIf we withdraw now, there’s a high risk of civil war and even more deaths. The alternative being considered by the UN and the US is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. However, I'm not sure this is a good idea in the long term because it will bring up issues of Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, as the news reports suggest the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister seems to lack control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting against less than a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in the Iraqi Parliament. The political process is quite tumultuous due to these radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this can be articulated in polite company.",
            "I guess I don't really know how I feel about the War in Iraq. I mean, it's like, what's the point? It wasn't even declared a war. It's more like a big get-back-at-Iraq thing, right? I mean, who do we think did 9/11? So, I don't really follow the details of it, but I know we're kind of just over there trying to build democracy and get oil. But it's not making anyone happy, and if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up again. It's so confusing! I mean, it's like, why are we still there? I don't know! I'm not really for the war, but I don't know if I'm against it either. It's hard to say. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it doesn't feel like one. We just have all these big guns and stuff to show we're powerful. But I don't think it's fair. It's like the Vietnam War, it was never declared, and now it's called a meaningless war. And I don't want Bush to be remembered as the worst president ever. It's just so unfair. And there are so many families with kids in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. But if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into something they're not. And that could make things worse. I mean, who knows what's going to happen in the end? It's just so hard to say. I guess it's going to go on for years.",
            "I strongly feel it's not appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to even consider it. I believe it's a matter that should be left to the churches, as the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any regulations over it would be a breach of what's already established in the constitution. I find it hypocritical for those who are pushing for its illegality to impose their beliefs on others, particularly when most Catholics and Christians oppose it. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of our constitution, promoting religious tolerance. I don't see why making an amendment about this issue would be necessary or beneficial, as it would only restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this at all. The president's push for this amendment is clearly driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it's not justified by any logical or economic reasons. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece on this topic.",
            "Ok, let's talk about the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to get started, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, they had very little to do with each other. The government used the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the terrorist attacks, to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nNow, I'm generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the government should have learned from the Vietnam War. The Iraq War was, in many ways, similar to Vietnam. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic government, just like they did in Vietnam. But they were not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and more importantly, they were not prepared for the insurgents who fought against them.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes. The war in Iraq has been going on for years, and many American troops have died. The U.S. is still there today, trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I don't think the government was prepared for it.\n\nThe U.S. government also made it seem like the invasion would be a short, successful mission, which was naïve. It's not an easy thing to implement a new form of government, especially after a long war. It took our own country a long time to become the powerful democracy it is today, with a lot of tension and civil war along the way.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to let him finish what he started, because it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping. But at the same time, we need to consider the staggering number of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the main reason is oil. The U.S. is getting its oil from Iraq, and it's usually all about money and controlling resources. Before the invasion, there were claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Yet, places like North Korea, which we know have these weapons, are not being attacked. I don't think the U.S. government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's been proven to have biological roots rather than sociological ones. This means that denying people the right to marry someone they love based on something they can't control is inhumane. I've always advocated for gay marriage and I believe that politics and government should stay out of people's personal lives. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who don't have the same rights as straight couples, but they function just like any other family. I think it's ridiculous for politicians to try and interpret marriage in a way that suits them. It's a personal matter, not a national or federal concern. I've heard from many sources that being homosexual can be influenced by biology, not upbringing. For example, a chemical reaction in the brain might predispose someone to be homosexual, rather than societal factors. It's unfair that two people can get married in secret without anyone knowing, but two gay people wanting to do the same gets front-page news. I believe marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal, and now it appears we're simply continuing the conflict to assert our status as a global superpower. Perhaps there were personal interests at play, like the previous feud between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While spreading democracy was a valid motivation, any hint of personal gain would have been unfair. I believe our initial goal was achieved in the first few months, as the war's start itself was a significant statement. Still, the prolonged conflict has left the original purpose diluted and misconceived, as it seems we're still at war for the sake of being at war, aiming for a decisive end that may never come.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on far too long. If our main objective was to install democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a just cause. However, I don't think our reasons have stayed true to this original intent. It seems we're still waging war just to wage war, without a clear end goal in sight. It's high time we let the local government take the reins and step back, as they will eventually have to handle their own affairs anyway. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, which could be better spent addressing our own pressing issues like poverty and infrastructure. It's a drain on our economy to keep funding a war that has lost its purpose over time.",
            "I wanted to clarify something. It seems that the situation you're referring to was prevented because someone went online and found some information. Anyway, I think it's okay. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much accessible to everyone. You have to understand that when you give someone access to your profile, you're allowing them to see it. So, if someone spotted something and prevented a situation, that's not an invasion of privacy. However, it might be difficult to monitor every profile to ensure safety, but it becomes discriminatory if they only target the \"bad kids.\" It depends on the context—whether they were actively searching for something specific or just stumbled upon it. I don't know, it's a tricky issue. I use Facebook, and I'm always aware that there are creepy people out there. I saw a TV show where a man easily found someone's information and convinced her to meet him. It's scary. Sometimes, people I don't recognize on my class list IM me, and I wonder if they know too much about me. It's a dangerous game balancing privacy and communication. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can see what. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seems a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or if they had the right to do that. It's a complex situation.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it\nNot only with women though\nI feel it has to do with the specific field of work that you’re engaged in\nUm\nI mean, for the most part, I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s this glass ceiling where, even though there’s supposed to be equality, many people struggle to work under a woman if they are a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, a lot of times in the workplace, women might see a job they’re qualified for\nBut the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd um\nI guess the same goes for men too\nAnd like other industries like fashion or\nUm being a parent at home\nIt’s really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male\nAnd um\nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you’re the male, you should be out working\nYou should be the money maker of your family\nWhy are you staying at home?\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them and maybe the wife has the better job\nAnd like it’s working out fine for them\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd then in the fashion industry\nUm\nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight\nI don’t know if that really makes sense\nBut I guess it’s because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nLike I guess have different lifestyles\nAnd so if you have the typical lifestyle and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry\nPeople will be like, well wait, how do I really know if you know anything about fashion if you’re a woman?\nLike you don’t really know what our case is like\nLike these other guys\nAnd so\nDepending on the field of work you’re in\nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds\nBut change is really slow so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process\nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works\nAnd um\nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nAnd so they do know what I’m talking about\nSo I guess you kind of have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, by not being too pushy\nBut um saying like the qualities of them\nBecause if you force it, people are going to resist\nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist\nAnd we’ve come a long way and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go on to become a CEO\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don’t know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "I understand that they didn’t outright legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means that getting caught with it is treated more like getting a traffic ticket than a criminal offense. While a decriminalized charge can still have serious future ramifications, such as making it difficult to pass a job interview, it does reduce the immediate consequences of being arrested and booked. On the other hand, there are costs involved in arresting, housing, and bringing individuals to court, especially in financially struggling communities. In a place like Denver, where the community tends to be more open-minded and liberal, decriminalizing marijuana might be a good decision. This could potentially free up funds for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. However, it's important to consider that widespread legalization could lead to marijuana being sold in gas stations and smoked in public, which might not be desirable. Additionally, while alcohol may have more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more enduring impact on an individual's lifestyle. I don't think that either substance should be generalized, as people react differently based on their personalities and behaviors.",
            "In my opinion, yes, there are some things that the Catholic Church has done traditionally that are quite old-fashioned. They've maintained these customs for long periods, which is good for grounding and maintaining traditions. However, it's also crucial to be open-minded to change. Many Catholics feel that they must attend Church weekly and adhere strictly to the Church's rules. This strictness sometimes makes it seem like the Church doesn't accept those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or aren't Catholic. For instance, my parents faced difficulties when it came to getting married in the Church because my father was an Episcopalian. This isn't really tolerant of other religions, which goes against the Church's teachings on loving others. I believe many Catholic doctrines tell us what to do, but the Church's practices don't always align with these teachings due to their outdated nature. I think it's a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't believe it would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. I think priests would act that way whether they're married or not, as the act involves children, not spouses. Therefore, I don't think allowing priests to marry would deter them from these behaviors. In my view, it wouldn't make a difference.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't declare one side as right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most complex topics we're dealing with today. The debate lies between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage, which is tricky without offending anyone. I think civil unions, regardless of the ceremony's religious context, should be treated equally by the government. After all, they're unions between two people, and the government shouldn't concern itself with the type of ceremony or religious significance. But if states can come to a logical consensus, they should push for federal recognition of civil unions. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd; it's not a cause large enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's simply not that important to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "You know, I was brought up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I've got a lot of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each state. I mean, there are so many democratic and republican states, and you can't deny that democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you're choosing to live there, so you should accept that state's position on the issue. I believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think the decision should be up to each state.\n\nI also think Bush shouldn't have a say in whether or not the whole country should be against gay marriage. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't dictate how each state wants to run. Plus, he'll be out of office soon enough, so it doesn't matter what he decides. I think some things are better left up to the individual states, as they'll be the ones to live with the decision. Let's just leave it at that.",
            "So, no, I don't think they should do that at all. Let me explain why. Myspace, it's a public platform, right? If you look at the definition, it's basically for people to see whatever you post. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it. It could be school officials or anyone else. They might see something you didn't intend for them to see. But, if something on the internet could potentially prevent a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. It's the school officials' responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and this might help them do just that. Now, if they're just using the internet to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it for the greater good, to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all. I mean, if you're a student posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's crazy. Everything you post on the internet is for the world to see, and it can come back to bite you later. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. And if they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place, then it's fine. But if they're just doing it to catch students, that's not good. It's like they're dropping their kids off at school and expecting it to be a safe place, and the school officials are doing their duty to ensure that. That's why they do drills and practice for emergencies. They're just trying to make the school safer and prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's all I have to say.",
