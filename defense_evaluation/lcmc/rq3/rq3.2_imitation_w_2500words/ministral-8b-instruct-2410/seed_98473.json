            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could stand to change in a few areas. They've been losing some of their followers, and I think it's due to their often steadfast views on certain topics. For instance, they have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can seem outdated in the modern world. If they were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, they might not face the same threat to their following.\n\nI've heard a lot of people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. For example, if someone is pro-abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a faith that views abortion as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they may not want to be part of a church that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI'm not sure why the Catholic Church can't ordain women as priests or allow priests to marry, but I think it would be beneficial for both the Church and its followers. It could help the Church appear more modern and relatable, while also giving priests a more balanced life. However, I'm not convinced that these changes would prevent the abuse scandals that have plagued the Church. It's hard to say if married priests or women priests would have made a difference in those situations. Ultimately, I believe that even with these changes, the Church might still face the same issues.",
            "Well, to be honest with you, I'm not one to argue against gay marriage. I mean, I think that whether someone is born with a certain sexual orientation or they choose it, it's not a conscious decision. Therefore, I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It's just wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I'd certainly say it's wrong to make such a distinction. It's not as if being gay is a choice, like being straight is for some people. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay, and I don't think that's something they should be held responsible for. I don't think it's a legal or moral issue that the federal government should be involved in. It's not about their security or moral concerns, it's just about being who they are. The federal government has no right to interfere with people's lives, especially if they haven't done anything wrong. That's just how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "It's my belief that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There really isn't a compelling reason not to. People often assert that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's just not that simple. There are so many variables involved that it's impossible to compare the two situations directly. It's like comparing heads and tails; they might look different, but they're both valid sides of the same coin. Furthermore, numerous civil rights are at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits where a partner can't be listed as next of kin if they're in a same-sex relationship. This seems unfair if you're committed to someone for life. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates in relationships as heterosexual couples. They just want the same legal document that any couple can receive from the government, a marriage certificate. Church and state involvement shouldn't be an issue when it comes to legalizing marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many people also worry about adoption issues and how children in same-sex families will be treated by society. I believe these concerns are overblown. Perhaps, in some cases, children in same-sex families may face challenges, but parenting skills and community involvement aren't affected by sexual orientation. The federal government should step in and legalize gay marriage across all states. The amendment should be reversed to reflect this. However, President Bush has strong religious views that influence his stance on the subject, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments against gay marriage are based on moral grounds, which vary greatly from person to person. It's unethical to impose the morality of one group on the entire country. Many people believe that gay people are psychologically damaged due to childhood trauma or personality defects, but the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. It's important to listen to institutions that conduct research rather than popular opinion.",
            "Well, first off, I'm working in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. I mean, we all know that. Having it available for the public? No, absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? I'd say yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. That's the thing. There are so many drugs that are illegal but are beneficial, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, things like that. Those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If you deny that just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then what's the point? You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI mean, it's not similar to alcohol. If you abuse it, alcohol can lead to bad things. But marijuana, if you abuse it, it's a tough one. I'd say, not that you could integrate it. You could let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. You gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. People have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. I mean, it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine. If we get rid of that image of marijuana as a horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe that the church has adapted to suit the twenty-first century, loosening its strictness. As I grew up, I'd attend church every Sunday, dressed to the nines in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, where I'd see friends at church on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that lasts just thirty minutes, and people wear more casual attire, especially during summer when they come straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, I see folks in jeans and khakis. I think the church has become more casual overall. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics, but the biggest thing I've noticed is the change in dress code and the introduction of a shorter mass. [OK, regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, like allowing female priests or priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided because there are men who become pedophiles even if they're married. It's more about individual predisposition than rules. If they really wanted to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer?] I think it's more about genetics influencing sexuality. People are born that way, not just from upbringing. I don't think marriage can change that. If the church knew about it and covered it up, that's shameful, but I don't think they always knew. [Do you have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church?] No.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was on board with the initial premise, but I believe everyone was still deeply affected by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. There were several reasons that led us into Iraq, including claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which have since been proven false.\nI find it utterly infuriating that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility.\nEven Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence he was presenting at the time.\nTo me, that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people, and I believe they've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution since the September 11th attacks.\nIt seems they came into office with an intent to go to war, perhaps driven by a desire to expand our energy supply.\nI think the Iraq war has gone on long enough, but I'm concerned that withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to try to restore order, but I'm not convinced that's a good idea in the long term.\nIraq's sovereignty could become a major issue, as the interim government appears to be dissolving.

            "Ok, let me see. I did just talk into it. Mm-hmm. How I feel about the War in Iraq? Well, at this point, it's kind of pointless, you know? I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? And it feels like it was just like, a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing because that's who we figured did the 9/11 attacks. So, I don't know. I'm not a big fan of the War on Iraq; I don't really keep up with the details. But I think at this point, we're over there to try and build democracy so it can become another U.S. kind of place and also to get oil from them. But it's not a reason to stay over there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up. Oh, this topic is so hard. The War in Iraq? Oh, man, it's so hard. I don't know what to say. Can you give me something else to go off of? Ok, thank you. Well, um, actually, I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is to show that we're big and American. But I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore because it never was declared by Congress. You have to declare a war by Congress, you know? I just don't think it's a real big point to stay over there and try. No, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also wasting our resources. And right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like he's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. because of what it's doing. Because remember, the Vietnam War was like undeclared, and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called that president forever because he started this meaningless war. Huh, you have to make this a half an hour, don't you? Uh, yeah. Well, I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there are so many families whose sons and daughters are in Iraq, and I want it to keep going because of that. But then again, it's hard to say we want them there because their culture is so different from ours. And if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into another United States, and it's going to be even worse for them. And it's going to make the Al-Qaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on the whole totalitarian thing for so long. That it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So, I think this whole thing is going to continue for years and years and years. Hmm, that's about it. Ok.",
            "I genuinely believe that it's not right to legalize it or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states our separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any rules or power over it would go against the principles already established in our constitution. I think those pushing for it are pitting one church's beliefs against others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in certain areas like Boston. It's not up to the government to decide what churches should or shouldn't make illegal. Our constitution already provides for religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been established. Plus, it's one of the few amendments that could be used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The person pushing for this amendment is doing so because it goes against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I truly believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no valid reason for an amendment banning it, as I don't see how it would impact the economy or society negatively. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nLet me start from the beginning. I don’t believe the government was completely honest with the American people about the war in Iraq. I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though there wasn't a strong connection. They played on the emotions of the American people, and the invasion started in 2003.\n\nI myself am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic one, a process that should have been carefully planned.\n\nI think the government didn't prepare well for the challenges that would follow, and they didn't account for the massive insurgency that would arise. They should have learned from the Vietnam War, where the US faced a similar challenge. The US government made it seem like victory would be swift and easy, which was naive and deceiving.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to finish what he started, but it's difficult to see how we can abandon Iraq now. We can't leave them without their government anymore. It's a tough decision because we’ve been there for so long and there are so many American casualties. But how much is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnother consideration is why we're not doing this in other countries. It seems to be about oil, and we get oil from Iraq. The government's justification for the war was about weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, North Korea has them, and we aren't making any attacks against them. I don't think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and brings peace, but I doubt it.",
            "Let's dive right in. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it should be a personal preference, not something that society or the government should interfere with. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they have no control over, especially when science shows it might be biological rather than sociological. In my neighborhood, I have a few openly gay couples who live together, and they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs on the street, and it's clear they're happy and loving. But the government, particularly with Bush trying to interpret marriage his way, is being ridiculous. It's like they're trying to play God. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that needs to be in the public's eye or dictated by the government. It's strange that a guy and a girl can get married in secret in Las Vegas, but if two gay people want to do the same, it makes the news. That's not fair.",

Obviously, the school isn't looking at these things, but someone in the community might notice and bring it to the school's attention.\n\nThere's no invasion of privacy when something is brought to the school's attention. If you don't want something to be seen, don't put it online. You can't tell people what to think or take seriously. The school officials aren't supposed to be monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IM's, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nFor example, a few months ago, someone overheard something in the school and got worried. They went through the person's Facebook and found something that was meant as a joke but became serious in light of the situation. If something is brought to the school's attention, there's no invasion of privacy, because the information was made public.\n\nTeachers shouldn't be creating accounts under different names and becoming friends with their students. I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook for the same reason. I don't want to see what they're doing or posting, like going out and drinking. If it's brought to their attention, though, the school has to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out far too long. I think the original intent was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we've strayed from that purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove our status as a superpower. The initial motivations were questionable, involving previous tensions between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to democratize a country with an unfair political system, that would be a valid reason for the war. However, I think our original objectives have become distorted, and we're now stuck in a conflict with an unclear endgame. We're still at war, not because we must, but because we don't want to retreat without a decisive victory. It's been drawn out for too long. The government there now needs to stand on its own, and we should focus on our own economic struggles. We're spending billions that could be better used on our own issues, like poverty and public infrastructure. The war is a long-term drain on our economy, and there are pressing domestic issues that need our attention. It's time to bring our troops home.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems like something was prevented because someone went online and found something, right? Like, maybe it was something on a site like Myspace? Well, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see, right? I understand that on Myspace, you usually have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, they have permission to see it. So, whenever you put information online, you have to understand that a lot of people might see it. In this case, I think it was actually good that someone found the information and prevented a life from being lost. It's a tough situation, though. How can you have one person looking at everyone's profiles all day to prevent that? That could lead to discrimination if they focus on the \"bad kids.\" I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at profiles. But maybe it depends on what they found and why. Were they looking for evidence of something? I don't know. I don't have a Myspace, but I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and talk to her within minutes. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who knew my screen name and sent me messages. They know my interests, what I look like, and even where I am during the day. It's hard because you think they know all about you. I try to limit what I put up there, but I want to communicate with my friends, so it's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might look at what.\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard my roommate mentioning that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and it struck me as a bit strange. How could school officials tell their students they weren't allowed to have it? I don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I'm not sure they had the right to tell people they couldn't have it. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have a couple more points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing this up\nI hate to admit it\nBut I was against the war from the start\nUm\nBut it's not as important now\nBecause the general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration\nAnd they don't want to admit they were wrong\nUm\nYou just have to look at the polls\nThey've done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls\nAnd about 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\n80 percent of Iraqis\nUm\n70 percent of the troops over there think it was a dumb idea, and they want us to pull out within the year\nUm\nI don't know\nIt's just been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a disaster before we even went in\nAnd now pulling out is going to be a disaster too\nThere's no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI think it's just the culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states\nThe gap is too big for the administration, or previous ones, to understand\nAnd they think they can just bring Democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist\nUm\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will just turn into a disaster\nLike quicksand\nUm\nI don't even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don't see a reason to stay\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas as to why we should stay\nBut I haven't heard a legitimate reason\nUm\nIf they want to do it gradually over a year or a bit longer\nI wouldn't really have a problem with that\nBut I just don't see a reason to stay any longer than that\nUm\nI mean, I read that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them think we should leave now\nUm\nThese are the people we're trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nYou know, I think they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out after that, we'll be the good guys\nWell, not really, no\nBut at least we won't be in the situation we're in now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I certainly believe that gender discrimination remains a significant issue in the United States. It’s not just about women; it extends to various fields of work. For instance, women often struggle to ascend to positions that they qualify for, as society is conditioned to view men as better suited for leadership roles in the business world. Similarly, men face challenges when they step into roles like stay-at-home dads or work in the fashion industry, where their expertise is often questioned. This isn’t confined to gender but extends to other factors like socioeconomic background. While we’ve made progress, change is slow. We can continue to promote acceptance by highlighting the positive attributes of those who defy societal norms without being too forceful. I believe we’re at a good balance where these changes are starting to be accepted. It’s a slow process, but we’re making progress. Discrimination isn’t just about gender; it also involves factors like where you come from and your background.",
            "Understood, they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. It's like going from a criminal offense to getting a traffic ticket. Catching someone with a drug charge could lead to job interview ramifications, but the worst ones usually don't disappear when it's decriminalized. There's an argument that arresting and processing people is expensive. It costs a lot to book, house, and process them, and even more to go through court and appoint a public defender. Municipalities might not make these concessions, even if it could free up money for other programs. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal, it's okay. They have more money now for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Marijuana isn't something you want to be everywhere, but there's a financial element to it. If it were totally legal, it could be sold in gas stations, leading to more people smoking and driving under its influence—something that's still taboo in many places. I think marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyle than just motor skills. Everyone reacts differently, and some people exercise moderation while others don't. Both substances have their adverse effects, and it's hard to generalize due to differing reactions.",
            "I would say yes, for sure. A lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing them for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week and they're quite strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So it might be a different realm, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, I guess people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's about children, which is different than a spouse. If you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "Well, I'm still on the fence about this whole debate on marriage. I haven't formed a solid opinion yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. But I must admit, this is one of the trickiest topics we're facing today, especially when it comes to the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. It's so sensitive that it's hard to discuss without offending someone.\n\nI think all civil unions should be looked at the same way by the government, just like a civil union. If you're married, I believe they should just treat it as a civil union, because that's essentially what it is - two people united. They shouldn't differentiate it based on the type of ceremony or belief system involved.\n\nAnd as for gay marriage, it's just another form of a civil union, really. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion about this, then it makes sense to push for federal recognition. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit nuanced for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not fully agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized and that it shouldn't be a national issue. I think the decision should be left to each state rather than the president dictating it for the entire country.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican, and it's clear which side of the issue they lean towards. If you live in a democratic state, you're well aware of its stance on gay marriage. So, if a state decides to legalize it, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and as such, I think gay marriage should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI don't feel as though former President Bush should have decided that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think he should have the power to dictate how each state runs itself, as he doesn't live in every single state. Plus, he's leaving office soon, and if a democratic president decides to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. I believe that some things should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will be most affected by their decision.",
            "Um, no, I don't think so.\nUm, let me see, I guess the thing is...\nMyspace is a public space, you know?\nLike, if you look at the definition of a bulletin board, it's basically for public display.\nUm, so if you post something on the internet, you have to understand that people, especially school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not.\nUm, and even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could still access it through their own homes, you know?\nBut, with something like trying to prevent a school shooting, well, as long as it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I think that's perfectly fine.\nI mean, if they're just going on there to catch students for doing something they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, then I feel like that's an invasion of privacy.\nBut if they're doing it to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all.\nUm, I mean, it's a public space, so you have to expect that people will see what you post.\nUm, like, if you're posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of ridiculous.\nUm, I mean, everything you post on the internet can come back to haunt you, you know?\nUm, like, if you're a college student and you post something that you don't want to be seen by the public later on, that can come back to bite you in the butt, you know?\nUm, like, once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\nUm, so you have to be careful about what you put out there.\nUm, like, I've had discussions with teachers about this, especially when I was in high school.\nUm, they said they have to make sure stuff like this is safe, you know?\nLike, they have to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the terrorist attacks.\nUm, and even though that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's still important to be safe about it.\nUm, so, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, you know?\nUm, like, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that.\nUm, so, that's basically what I was trying to say, you know?",
            "In the beginning, the war seemed like a good idea to me, especially considering the personal impact of nine eleven. I was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they did for us. However, I think we overlooked many things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared and without a clear plan, and I believe it backfired on us. Now, I'm very much against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. The people over there, they're fighting with each other, and I don't think us being there will stop that. They're just looking to get us out of there, and I think that should be fine. We just need to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. We didn't consider what this could lead to or how they would react to our presence. The president, at the time, was driven by public sentiment and his own desire to act. I understand that, but I think we could have had a better plan. We really didn't know what we were supposed to do to create order. There was no unity or clear purpose. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always going to be like that. We're not making enough progress, and I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it will collapse. We can't stay there forever. I don't think we're doing ourselves any good by staying there."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could stand to change in a few areas. They've been losing some of their followers, and I think it's due to their often steadfast views on certain topics. For instance, they have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can seem outdated in the modern world. If they were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, they might not face the same threat to their following.\n\nI've heard a lot of people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. For example, if someone is pro-abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a faith that views abortion as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they may not want to be part of a church that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI'm not sure why the Catholic Church can't ordain women as priests or allow priests to marry, but I think it would be beneficial for both the Church and its followers. It could help the Church appear more modern and relatable, while also giving priests a more balanced life. However, I'm not convinced that these changes would prevent the abuse scandals that have plagued the Church. It's hard to say if married priests or women priests would have made a difference in those situations. Ultimately, I believe that even with these changes, the Church might still face the same issues.",
            "Well, to be honest with you, I'm not one to argue against gay marriage. I mean, I think that whether someone is born with a certain sexual orientation or they choose it, it's not a conscious decision. Therefore, I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It's just wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I'd certainly say it's wrong to make such a distinction. It's not as if being gay is a choice, like being straight is for some people. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay, and I don't think that's something they should be held responsible for. I don't think it's a legal or moral issue that the federal government should be involved in. It's not about their security or moral concerns, it's just about being who they are. The federal government has no right to interfere with people's lives, especially if they haven't done anything wrong. That's just how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "It's my belief that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There really isn't a compelling reason not to. People often assert that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's just not that simple. There are so many variables involved that it's impossible to compare the two situations directly. It's like comparing heads and tails; they might look different, but they're both valid sides of the same coin. Furthermore, numerous civil rights are at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits where a partner can't be listed as next of kin if they're in a same-sex relationship. This seems unfair if you're committed to someone for life. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates in relationships as heterosexual couples. They just want the same legal document that any couple can receive from the government, a marriage certificate. Church and state involvement shouldn't be an issue when it comes to legalizing marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many people also worry about adoption issues and how children in same-sex families will be treated by society. I believe these concerns are overblown. Perhaps, in some cases, children in same-sex families may face challenges, but parenting skills and community involvement aren't affected by sexual orientation. The federal government should step in and legalize gay marriage across all states. The amendment should be reversed to reflect this. However, President Bush has strong religious views that influence his stance on the subject, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments against gay marriage are based on moral grounds, which vary greatly from person to person. It's unethical to impose the morality of one group on the entire country. Many people believe that gay people are psychologically damaged due to childhood trauma or personality defects, but the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. It's important to listen to institutions that conduct research rather than popular opinion.",
            "Well, first off, I'm working in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. I mean, we all know that. Having it available for the public? No, absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? I'd say yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. That's the thing. There are so many drugs that are illegal but are beneficial, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, things like that. Those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If you deny that just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then what's the point? You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI mean, it's not similar to alcohol. If you abuse it, alcohol can lead to bad things. But marijuana, if you abuse it, it's a tough one. I'd say, not that you could integrate it. You could let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. You gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. People have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. I mean, it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine. If we get rid of that image of marijuana as a horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe that the church has adapted to suit the twenty-first century, loosening its strictness. As I grew up, I'd attend church every Sunday, dressed to the nines in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, where I'd see friends at church on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that lasts just thirty minutes, and people wear more casual attire, especially during summer when they come straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, I see folks in jeans and khakis. I think the church has become more casual overall. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics, but the biggest thing I've noticed is the change in dress code and the introduction of a shorter mass. [OK, regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, like allowing female priests or priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided because there are men who become pedophiles even if they're married. It's more about individual predisposition than rules. If they really wanted to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer?] I think it's more about genetics influencing sexuality. People are born that way, not just from upbringing. I don't think marriage can change that. If the church knew about it and covered it up, that's shameful, but I don't think they always knew. [Do you have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church?] No.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was on board with the initial premise, but I believe everyone was still deeply affected by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. There were several reasons that led us into Iraq, including claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which have since been proven false.\nI find it utterly infuriating that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility.\nEven Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence he was presenting at the time.\nTo me, that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people, and I believe they've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution since the September 11th attacks.\nIt seems they came into office with an intent to go to war, perhaps driven by a desire to expand our energy supply.\nI think the Iraq war has gone on long enough, but I'm concerned that withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to try to restore order, but I'm not convinced that's a good idea in the long term.\nIraq's sovereignty could become a major issue, as the interim government appears to be dissolving.

            "Ok, let me see. I did just talk into it. Mm-hmm. How I feel about the War in Iraq? Well, at this point, it's kind of pointless, you know? I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? And it feels like it was just like, a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing because that's who we figured did the 9/11 attacks. So, I don't know. I'm not a big fan of the War on Iraq; I don't really keep up with the details. But I think at this point, we're over there to try and build democracy so it can become another U.S. kind of place and also to get oil from them. But it's not a reason to stay over there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up. Oh, this topic is so hard. The War in Iraq? Oh, man, it's so hard. I don't know what to say. Can you give me something else to go off of? Ok, thank you. Well, um, actually, I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is to show that we're big and American. But I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore because it never was declared by Congress. You have to declare a war by Congress, you know? I just don't think it's a real big point to stay over there and try. No, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also wasting our resources. And right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like he's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. because of what it's doing. Because remember, the Vietnam War was like undeclared, and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called that president forever because he started this meaningless war. Huh, you have to make this a half an hour, don't you? Uh, yeah. Well, I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there are so many families whose sons and daughters are in Iraq, and I want it to keep going because of that. But then again, it's hard to say we want them there because their culture is so different from ours. And if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into another United States, and it's going to be even worse for them. And it's going to make the Al-Qaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on the whole totalitarian thing for so long. That it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So, I think this whole thing is going to continue for years and years and years. Hmm, that's about it. Ok.",
            "I genuinely believe that it's not right to legalize it or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states our separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any rules or power over it would go against the principles already established in our constitution. I think those pushing for it are pitting one church's beliefs against others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in certain areas like Boston. It's not up to the government to decide what churches should or shouldn't make illegal. Our constitution already provides for religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been established. Plus, it's one of the few amendments that could be used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The person pushing for this amendment is doing so because it goes against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I truly believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no valid reason for an amendment banning it, as I don't see how it would impact the economy or society negatively. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nLet me start from the beginning. I don’t believe the government was completely honest with the American people about the war in Iraq. I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though there wasn't a strong connection. They played on the emotions of the American people, and the invasion started in 2003.\n\nI myself am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic one, a process that should have been carefully planned.\n\nI think the government didn't prepare well for the challenges that would follow, and they didn't account for the massive insurgency that would arise. They should have learned from the Vietnam War, where the US faced a similar challenge. The US government made it seem like victory would be swift and easy, which was naive and deceiving.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to finish what he started, but it's difficult to see how we can abandon Iraq now. We can't leave them without their government anymore. It's a tough decision because we’ve been there for so long and there are so many American casualties. But how much is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnother consideration is why we're not doing this in other countries. It seems to be about oil, and we get oil from Iraq. The government's justification for the war was about weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, North Korea has them, and we aren't making any attacks against them. I don't think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and brings peace, but I doubt it.",
            "Let's dive right in. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it should be a personal preference, not something that society or the government should interfere with. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they have no control over, especially when science shows it might be biological rather than sociological. In my neighborhood, I have a few openly gay couples who live together, and they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs on the street, and it's clear they're happy and loving. But the government, particularly with Bush trying to interpret marriage his way, is being ridiculous. It's like they're trying to play God. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that needs to be in the public's eye or dictated by the government. It's strange that a guy and a girl can get married in secret in Las Vegas, but if two gay people want to do the same, it makes the news. That's not fair.",

Obviously, the school isn't looking at these things, but someone in the community might notice and bring it to the school's attention.\n\nThere's no invasion of privacy when something is brought to the school's attention. If you don't want something to be seen, don't put it online. You can't tell people what to think or take seriously. The school officials aren't supposed to be monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IM's, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nFor example, a few months ago, someone overheard something in the school and got worried. They went through the person's Facebook and found something that was meant as a joke but became serious in light of the situation. If something is brought to the school's attention, there's no invasion of privacy, because the information was made public.\n\nTeachers shouldn't be creating accounts under different names and becoming friends with their students. I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook for the same reason. I don't want to see what they're doing or posting, like going out and drinking. If it's brought to their attention, though, the school has to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out far too long. I think the original intent was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we've strayed from that purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove our status as a superpower. The initial motivations were questionable, involving previous tensions between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to democratize a country with an unfair political system, that would be a valid reason for the war. However, I think our original objectives have become distorted, and we're now stuck in a conflict with an unclear endgame. We're still at war, not because we must, but because we don't want to retreat without a decisive victory. It's been drawn out for too long. The government there now needs to stand on its own, and we should focus on our own economic struggles. We're spending billions that could be better used on our own issues, like poverty and public infrastructure. The war is a long-term drain on our economy, and there are pressing domestic issues that need our attention. It's time to bring our troops home.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems like something was prevented because someone went online and found something, right? Like, maybe it was something on a site like Myspace? Well, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see, right? I understand that on Myspace, you usually have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, they have permission to see it. So, whenever you put information online, you have to understand that a lot of people might see it. In this case, I think it was actually good that someone found the information and prevented a life from being lost. It's a tough situation, though. How can you have one person looking at everyone's profiles all day to prevent that? That could lead to discrimination if they focus on the \"bad kids.\" I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at profiles. But maybe it depends on what they found and why. Were they looking for evidence of something? I don't know. I don't have a Myspace, but I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and talk to her within minutes. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who knew my screen name and sent me messages. They know my interests, what I look like, and even where I am during the day. It's hard because you think they know all about you. I try to limit what I put up there, but I want to communicate with my friends, so it's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might look at what.\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard my roommate mentioning that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and it struck me as a bit strange. How could school officials tell their students they weren't allowed to have it? I don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I'm not sure they had the right to tell people they couldn't have it. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have a couple more points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing this up\nI hate to admit it\nBut I was against the war from the start\nUm\nBut it's not as important now\nBecause the general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration\nAnd they don't want to admit they were wrong\nUm\nYou just have to look at the polls\nThey've done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls\nAnd about 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\n80 percent of Iraqis\nUm\n70 percent of the troops over there think it was a dumb idea, and they want us to pull out within the year\nUm\nI don't know\nIt's just been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a disaster before we even went in\nAnd now pulling out is going to be a disaster too\nThere's no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI think it's just the culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states\nThe gap is too big for the administration, or previous ones, to understand\nAnd they think they can just bring Democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist\nUm\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will just turn into a disaster\nLike quicksand\nUm\nI don't even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don't see a reason to stay\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas as to why we should stay\nBut I haven't heard a legitimate reason\nUm\nIf they want to do it gradually over a year or a bit longer\nI wouldn't really have a problem with that\nBut I just don't see a reason to stay any longer than that\nUm\nI mean, I read that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them think we should leave now\nUm\nThese are the people we're trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nYou know, I think they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out after that, we'll be the good guys\nWell, not really, no\nBut at least we won't be in the situation we're in now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I certainly believe that gender discrimination remains a significant issue in the United States. It’s not just about women; it extends to various fields of work. For instance, women often struggle to ascend to positions that they qualify for, as society is conditioned to view men as better suited for leadership roles in the business world. Similarly, men face challenges when they step into roles like stay-at-home dads or work in the fashion industry, where their expertise is often questioned. This isn’t confined to gender but extends to other factors like socioeconomic background. While we’ve made progress, change is slow. We can continue to promote acceptance by highlighting the positive attributes of those who defy societal norms without being too forceful. I believe we’re at a good balance where these changes are starting to be accepted. It’s a slow process, but we’re making progress. Discrimination isn’t just about gender; it also involves factors like where you come from and your background.",
            "Understood, they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. It's like going from a criminal offense to getting a traffic ticket. Catching someone with a drug charge could lead to job interview ramifications, but the worst ones usually don't disappear when it's decriminalized. There's an argument that arresting and processing people is expensive. It costs a lot to book, house, and process them, and even more to go through court and appoint a public defender. Municipalities might not make these concessions, even if it could free up money for other programs. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal, it's okay. They have more money now for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Marijuana isn't something you want to be everywhere, but there's a financial element to it. If it were totally legal, it could be sold in gas stations, leading to more people smoking and driving under its influence—something that's still taboo in many places. I think marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyle than just motor skills. Everyone reacts differently, and some people exercise moderation while others don't. Both substances have their adverse effects, and it's hard to generalize due to differing reactions.",
            "I would say yes, for sure. A lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing them for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week and they're quite strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So it might be a different realm, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, I guess people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's about children, which is different than a spouse. If you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "Well, I'm still on the fence about this whole debate on marriage. I haven't formed a solid opinion yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. But I must admit, this is one of the trickiest topics we're facing today, especially when it comes to the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. It's so sensitive that it's hard to discuss without offending someone.\n\nI think all civil unions should be looked at the same way by the government, just like a civil union. If you're married, I believe they should just treat it as a civil union, because that's essentially what it is - two people united. They shouldn't differentiate it based on the type of ceremony or belief system involved.\n\nAnd as for gay marriage, it's just another form of a civil union, really. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion about this, then it makes sense to push for federal recognition. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit nuanced for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not fully agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized and that it shouldn't be a national issue. I think the decision should be left to each state rather than the president dictating it for the entire country.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican, and it's clear which side of the issue they lean towards. If you live in a democratic state, you're well aware of its stance on gay marriage. So, if a state decides to legalize it, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and as such, I think gay marriage should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI don't feel as though former President Bush should have decided that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think he should have the power to dictate how each state runs itself, as he doesn't live in every single state. Plus, he's leaving office soon, and if a democratic president decides to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. I believe that some things should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will be most affected by their decision.",
            "Um, no, I don't think so.\nUm, let me see, I guess the thing is...\nMyspace is a public space, you know?\nLike, if you look at the definition of a bulletin board, it's basically for public display.\nUm, so if you post something on the internet, you have to understand that people, especially school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not.\nUm, and even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could still access it through their own homes, you know?\nBut, with something like trying to prevent a school shooting, well, as long as it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I think that's perfectly fine.\nI mean, if they're just going on there to catch students for doing something they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, then I feel like that's an invasion of privacy.\nBut if they're doing it to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all.\nUm, I mean, it's a public space, so you have to expect that people will see what you post.\nUm, like, if you're posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of ridiculous.\nUm, I mean, everything you post on the internet can come back to haunt you, you know?\nUm, like, if you're a college student and you post something that you don't want to be seen by the public later on, that can come back to bite you in the butt, you know?\nUm, like, once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\nUm, so you have to be careful about what you put out there.\nUm, like, I've had discussions with teachers about this, especially when I was in high school.\nUm, they said they have to make sure stuff like this is safe, you know?\nLike, they have to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the terrorist attacks.\nUm, and even though that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's still important to be safe about it.\nUm, so, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, you know?\nUm, like, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that.\nUm, so, that's basically what I was trying to say, you know?",
            "In the beginning, the war seemed like a good idea to me, especially considering the personal impact of nine eleven. I was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they did for us. However, I think we overlooked many things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared and without a clear plan, and I believe it backfired on us. Now, I'm very much against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. The people over there, they're fighting with each other, and I don't think us being there will stop that. They're just looking to get us out of there, and I think that should be fine. We just need to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. We didn't consider what this could lead to or how they would react to our presence. The president, at the time, was driven by public sentiment and his own desire to act. I understand that, but I think we could have had a better plan. We really didn't know what we were supposed to do to create order. There was no unity or clear purpose. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always going to be like that. We're not making enough progress, and I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it will collapse. We can't stay there forever. I don't think we're doing ourselves any good by staying there."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could stand to change in a few areas. They've been losing some of their followers, and I think it's due to their often steadfast views on certain topics. For instance, they have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can seem outdated in the modern world. If they were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, they might not face the same threat to their following.\n\nI've heard a lot of people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. For example, if someone is pro-abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a faith that views abortion as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they may not want to be part of a church that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI'm not sure why the Catholic Church can't ordain women as priests or allow priests to marry, but I think it would be beneficial for both the Church and its followers. It could help the Church appear more modern and relatable, while also giving priests a more balanced life. However, I'm not convinced that these changes would prevent the abuse scandals that have plagued the Church. It's hard to say if married priests or women priests would have made a difference in those situations. Ultimately, I believe that even with these changes, the Church might still face the same issues.",
            "Well, to be honest with you, I'm not one to argue against gay marriage. I mean, I think that whether someone is born with a certain sexual orientation or they choose it, it's not a conscious decision. Therefore, I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It's just wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I'd certainly say it's wrong to make such a distinction. It's not as if being gay is a choice, like being straight is for some people. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay, and I don't think that's something they should be held responsible for. I don't think it's a legal or moral issue that the federal government should be involved in. It's not about their security or moral concerns, it's just about being who they are. The federal government has no right to interfere with people's lives, especially if they haven't done anything wrong. That's just how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "It's my belief that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There really isn't a compelling reason not to. People often assert that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's just not that simple. There are so many variables involved that it's impossible to compare the two situations directly. It's like comparing heads and tails; they might look different, but they're both valid sides of the same coin. Furthermore, numerous civil rights are at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits where a partner can't be listed as next of kin if they're in a same-sex relationship. This seems unfair if you're committed to someone for life. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates in relationships as heterosexual couples. They just want the same legal document that any couple can receive from the government, a marriage certificate. Church and state involvement shouldn't be an issue when it comes to legalizing marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many people also worry about adoption issues and how children in same-sex families will be treated by society. I believe these concerns are overblown. Perhaps, in some cases, children in same-sex families may face challenges, but parenting skills and community involvement aren't affected by sexual orientation. The federal government should step in and legalize gay marriage across all states. The amendment should be reversed to reflect this. However, President Bush has strong religious views that influence his stance on the subject, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments against gay marriage are based on moral grounds, which vary greatly from person to person. It's unethical to impose the morality of one group on the entire country. Many people believe that gay people are psychologically damaged due to childhood trauma or personality defects, but the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. It's important to listen to institutions that conduct research rather than popular opinion.",
            "Well, first off, I'm working in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. I mean, we all know that. Having it available for the public? No, absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? I'd say yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. That's the thing. There are so many drugs that are illegal but are beneficial, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, things like that. Those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If you deny that just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then what's the point? You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI mean, it's not similar to alcohol. If you abuse it, alcohol can lead to bad things. But marijuana, if you abuse it, it's a tough one. I'd say, not that you could integrate it. You could let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. You gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. People have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. I mean, it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine. If we get rid of that image of marijuana as a horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe that the church has adapted to suit the twenty-first century, loosening its strictness. As I grew up, I'd attend church every Sunday, dressed to the nines in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, where I'd see friends at church on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that lasts just thirty minutes, and people wear more casual attire, especially during summer when they come straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, I see folks in jeans and khakis. I think the church has become more casual overall. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics, but the biggest thing I've noticed is the change in dress code and the introduction of a shorter mass. [OK, regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, like allowing female priests or priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided because there are men who become pedophiles even if they're married. It's more about individual predisposition than rules. If they really wanted to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer?] I think it's more about genetics influencing sexuality. People are born that way, not just from upbringing. I don't think marriage can change that. If the church knew about it and covered it up, that's shameful, but I don't think they always knew. [Do you have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church?] No.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was on board with the initial premise, but I believe everyone was still deeply affected by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. There were several reasons that led us into Iraq, including claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which have since been proven false.\nI find it utterly infuriating that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility.\nEven Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence he was presenting at the time.\nTo me, that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people, and I believe they've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution since the September 11th attacks.\nIt seems they came into office with an intent to go to war, perhaps driven by a desire to expand our energy supply.\nI think the Iraq war has gone on long enough, but I'm concerned that withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to try to restore order, but I'm not convinced that's a good idea in the long term.\nIraq's sovereignty could become a major issue, as the interim government appears to be dissolving.

            "Ok, let me see. I did just talk into it. Mm-hmm. How I feel about the War in Iraq? Well, at this point, it's kind of pointless, you know? I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? And it feels like it was just like, a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing because that's who we figured did the 9/11 attacks. So, I don't know. I'm not a big fan of the War on Iraq; I don't really keep up with the details. But I think at this point, we're over there to try and build democracy so it can become another U.S. kind of place and also to get oil from them. But it's not a reason to stay over there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up. Oh, this topic is so hard. The War in Iraq? Oh, man, it's so hard. I don't know what to say. Can you give me something else to go off of? Ok, thank you. Well, um, actually, I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is to show that we're big and American. But I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore because it never was declared by Congress. You have to declare a war by Congress, you know? I just don't think it's a real big point to stay over there and try. No, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also wasting our resources. And right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like he's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. because of what it's doing. Because remember, the Vietnam War was like undeclared, and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called that president forever because he started this meaningless war. Huh, you have to make this a half an hour, don't you? Uh, yeah. Well, I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there are so many families whose sons and daughters are in Iraq, and I want it to keep going because of that. But then again, it's hard to say we want them there because their culture is so different from ours. And if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into another United States, and it's going to be even worse for them. And it's going to make the Al-Qaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on the whole totalitarian thing for so long. That it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So, I think this whole thing is going to continue for years and years and years. Hmm, that's about it. Ok.",
            "I genuinely believe that it's not right to legalize it or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states our separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any rules or power over it would go against the principles already established in our constitution. I think those pushing for it are pitting one church's beliefs against others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in certain areas like Boston. It's not up to the government to decide what churches should or shouldn't make illegal. Our constitution already provides for religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been established. Plus, it's one of the few amendments that could be used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The person pushing for this amendment is doing so because it goes against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I truly believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no valid reason for an amendment banning it, as I don't see how it would impact the economy or society negatively. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nLet me start from the beginning. I don’t believe the government was completely honest with the American people about the war in Iraq. I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though there wasn't a strong connection. They played on the emotions of the American people, and the invasion started in 2003.\n\nI myself am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic one, a process that should have been carefully planned.\n\nI think the government didn't prepare well for the challenges that would follow, and they didn't account for the massive insurgency that would arise. They should have learned from the Vietnam War, where the US faced a similar challenge. The US government made it seem like victory would be swift and easy, which was naive and deceiving.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to finish what he started, but it's difficult to see how we can abandon Iraq now. We can't leave them without their government anymore. It's a tough decision because we’ve been there for so long and there are so many American casualties. But how much is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnother consideration is why we're not doing this in other countries. It seems to be about oil, and we get oil from Iraq. The government's justification for the war was about weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, North Korea has them, and we aren't making any attacks against them. I don't think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and brings peace, but I doubt it.",
            "Let's dive right in. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it should be a personal preference, not something that society or the government should interfere with. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they have no control over, especially when science shows it might be biological rather than sociological. In my neighborhood, I have a few openly gay couples who live together, and they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs on the street, and it's clear they're happy and loving. But the government, particularly with Bush trying to interpret marriage his way, is being ridiculous. It's like they're trying to play God. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that needs to be in the public's eye or dictated by the government. It's strange that a guy and a girl can get married in secret in Las Vegas, but if two gay people want to do the same, it makes the news. That's not fair.",

Obviously, the school isn't looking at these things, but someone in the community might notice and bring it to the school's attention.\n\nThere's no invasion of privacy when something is brought to the school's attention. If you don't want something to be seen, don't put it online. You can't tell people what to think or take seriously. The school officials aren't supposed to be monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IM's, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nFor example, a few months ago, someone overheard something in the school and got worried. They went through the person's Facebook and found something that was meant as a joke but became serious in light of the situation. If something is brought to the school's attention, there's no invasion of privacy, because the information was made public.\n\nTeachers shouldn't be creating accounts under different names and becoming friends with their students. I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook for the same reason. I don't want to see what they're doing or posting, like going out and drinking. If it's brought to their attention, though, the school has to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out far too long. I think the original intent was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we've strayed from that purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove our status as a superpower. The initial motivations were questionable, involving previous tensions between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to democratize a country with an unfair political system, that would be a valid reason for the war. However, I think our original objectives have become distorted, and we're now stuck in a conflict with an unclear endgame. We're still at war, not because we must, but because we don't want to retreat without a decisive victory. It's been drawn out for too long. The government there now needs to stand on its own, and we should focus on our own economic struggles. We're spending billions that could be better used on our own issues, like poverty and public infrastructure. The war is a long-term drain on our economy, and there are pressing domestic issues that need our attention. It's time to bring our troops home.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems like something was prevented because someone went online and found something, right? Like, maybe it was something on a site like Myspace? Well, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see, right? I understand that on Myspace, you usually have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, they have permission to see it. So, whenever you put information online, you have to understand that a lot of people might see it. In this case, I think it was actually good that someone found the information and prevented a life from being lost. It's a tough situation, though. How can you have one person looking at everyone's profiles all day to prevent that? That could lead to discrimination if they focus on the \"bad kids.\" I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at profiles. But maybe it depends on what they found and why. Were they looking for evidence of something? I don't know. I don't have a Myspace, but I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and talk to her within minutes. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who knew my screen name and sent me messages. They know my interests, what I look like, and even where I am during the day. It's hard because you think they know all about you. I try to limit what I put up there, but I want to communicate with my friends, so it's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might look at what.\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard my roommate mentioning that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and it struck me as a bit strange. How could school officials tell their students they weren't allowed to have it? I don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I'm not sure they had the right to tell people they couldn't have it. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have a couple more points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing this up\nI hate to admit it\nBut I was against the war from the start\nUm\nBut it's not as important now\nBecause the general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration\nAnd they don't want to admit they were wrong\nUm\nYou just have to look at the polls\nThey've done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls\nAnd about 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\n80 percent of Iraqis\nUm\n70 percent of the troops over there think it was a dumb idea, and they want us to pull out within the year\nUm\nI don't know\nIt's just been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a disaster before we even went in\nAnd now pulling out is going to be a disaster too\nThere's no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI think it's just the culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states\nThe gap is too big for the administration, or previous ones, to understand\nAnd they think they can just bring Democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist\nUm\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will just turn into a disaster\nLike quicksand\nUm\nI don't even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don't see a reason to stay\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas as to why we should stay\nBut I haven't heard a legitimate reason\nUm\nIf they want to do it gradually over a year or a bit longer\nI wouldn't really have a problem with that\nBut I just don't see a reason to stay any longer than that\nUm\nI mean, I read that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them think we should leave now\nUm\nThese are the people we're trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nYou know, I think they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out after that, we'll be the good guys\nWell, not really, no\nBut at least we won't be in the situation we're in now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I certainly believe that gender discrimination remains a significant issue in the United States. It’s not just about women; it extends to various fields of work. For instance, women often struggle to ascend to positions that they qualify for, as society is conditioned to view men as better suited for leadership roles in the business world. Similarly, men face challenges when they step into roles like stay-at-home dads or work in the fashion industry, where their expertise is often questioned. This isn’t confined to gender but extends to other factors like socioeconomic background. While we’ve made progress, change is slow. We can continue to promote acceptance by highlighting the positive attributes of those who defy societal norms without being too forceful. I believe we’re at a good balance where these changes are starting to be accepted. It’s a slow process, but we’re making progress. Discrimination isn’t just about gender; it also involves factors like where you come from and your background.",
            "Understood, they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. It's like going from a criminal offense to getting a traffic ticket. Catching someone with a drug charge could lead to job interview ramifications, but the worst ones usually don't disappear when it's decriminalized. There's an argument that arresting and processing people is expensive. It costs a lot to book, house, and process them, and even more to go through court and appoint a public defender. Municipalities might not make these concessions, even if it could free up money for other programs. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal, it's okay. They have more money now for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Marijuana isn't something you want to be everywhere, but there's a financial element to it. If it were totally legal, it could be sold in gas stations, leading to more people smoking and driving under its influence—something that's still taboo in many places. I think marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyle than just motor skills. Everyone reacts differently, and some people exercise moderation while others don't. Both substances have their adverse effects, and it's hard to generalize due to differing reactions.",
            "I would say yes, for sure. A lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing them for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week and they're quite strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So it might be a different realm, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, I guess people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's about children, which is different than a spouse. If you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "Well, I'm still on the fence about this whole debate on marriage. I haven't formed a solid opinion yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. But I must admit, this is one of the trickiest topics we're facing today, especially when it comes to the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. It's so sensitive that it's hard to discuss without offending someone.\n\nI think all civil unions should be looked at the same way by the government, just like a civil union. If you're married, I believe they should just treat it as a civil union, because that's essentially what it is - two people united. They shouldn't differentiate it based on the type of ceremony or belief system involved.\n\nAnd as for gay marriage, it's just another form of a civil union, really. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion about this, then it makes sense to push for federal recognition. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit nuanced for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not fully agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized and that it shouldn't be a national issue. I think the decision should be left to each state rather than the president dictating it for the entire country.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican, and it's clear which side of the issue they lean towards. If you live in a democratic state, you're well aware of its stance on gay marriage. So, if a state decides to legalize it, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and as such, I think gay marriage should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI don't feel as though former President Bush should have decided that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think he should have the power to dictate how each state runs itself, as he doesn't live in every single state. Plus, he's leaving office soon, and if a democratic president decides to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. I believe that some things should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will be most affected by their decision.",
            "Um, no, I don't think so.\nUm, let me see, I guess the thing is...\nMyspace is a public space, you know?\nLike, if you look at the definition of a bulletin board, it's basically for public display.\nUm, so if you post something on the internet, you have to understand that people, especially school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not.\nUm, and even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could still access it through their own homes, you know?\nBut, with something like trying to prevent a school shooting, well, as long as it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I think that's perfectly fine.\nI mean, if they're just going on there to catch students for doing something they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, then I feel like that's an invasion of privacy.\nBut if they're doing it to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all.\nUm, I mean, it's a public space, so you have to expect that people will see what you post.\nUm, like, if you're posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of ridiculous.\nUm, I mean, everything you post on the internet can come back to haunt you, you know?\nUm, like, if you're a college student and you post something that you don't want to be seen by the public later on, that can come back to bite you in the butt, you know?\nUm, like, once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\nUm, so you have to be careful about what you put out there.\nUm, like, I've had discussions with teachers about this, especially when I was in high school.\nUm, they said they have to make sure stuff like this is safe, you know?\nLike, they have to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the terrorist attacks.\nUm, and even though that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's still important to be safe about it.\nUm, so, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, you know?\nUm, like, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that.\nUm, so, that's basically what I was trying to say, you know?",
            "In the beginning, the war seemed like a good idea to me, especially considering the personal impact of nine eleven. I was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they did for us. However, I think we overlooked many things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared and without a clear plan, and I believe it backfired on us. Now, I'm very much against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. The people over there, they're fighting with each other, and I don't think us being there will stop that. They're just looking to get us out of there, and I think that should be fine. We just need to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. We didn't consider what this could lead to or how they would react to our presence. The president, at the time, was driven by public sentiment and his own desire to act. I understand that, but I think we could have had a better plan. We really didn't know what we were supposed to do to create order. There was no unity or clear purpose. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always going to be like that. We're not making enough progress, and I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it will collapse. We can't stay there forever. I don't think we're doing ourselves any good by staying there."
