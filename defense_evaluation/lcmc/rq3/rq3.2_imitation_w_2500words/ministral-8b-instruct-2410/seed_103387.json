            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that in several ways, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. They have been discussing how their following is declining, and I believe it's because they are often quite rigid in their views on various topics. For instance, they're strongly opposed to gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can make it difficult for those with differing opinions to feel welcomed. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, I think they could maintain a strong base of followers. I've also heard that more people are turning against the Church due to their stance on these issues, and it's causing a bit of a division. While the Church is against abortion, if someone is for it, they might not want to be part of a community that sees it as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they might not want to follow a Church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see a reason why priests couldn't be married or why women couldn't be priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the declining following. After all, the Church did something that might not have been affected by these changes. If priests were allowed to marry, would they have done things differently? It's hard to say. However, I don't see why priests can't have both their religious devotion and their family life, just like everyone else.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that whether someone is gay or not is not a conscious choice they make. So I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's not right to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice like they don't have a say in how they are born. I mean, I was born straight, and I didn't choose that either. It doesn't seem like they can be held accountable for something they can't change. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It's not about national security or anything like that. They shouldn't interfere in people's lives because being gay is just how they were born. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Here are some reasons why:\n\nMany people argue that allowing same-sex couples to marry would pose a threat to traditional families, but I think it’s a misconception. The dynamics of a relationship are so varied and complex that comparing it to something as simple as a coin isn’t quite accurate. Heterosexual and homosexual couples have the same basic elements that contribute to a successful and satisfying relationship, like love, commitment, and shared values.\n\nMoreover, many civil rights protections are tied to marriage, such as property rights and healthcare benefits. For instance, a partner in a same-sex relationship might not be allowed to visit their spouse in the hospital, and they might not be able to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This can be unfair if you’re spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It’s a relationship, plain and simple. Many people seem to get hung up on the idea that homosexuals are asking for the right to get married in a church, but what they’re really asking for is a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement from the church, I don’t see why there should be an issue.\n\nLegalizing gay marriage is similar to the segregation but separate issue. It’s unfair and unequal. Just like heterosexual couples, homosexual couples can take on different roles in the relationship, and they have the same potential for community involvement. The concern about children of gay couples is a valid one, but it’s too early to say how they’ll be affected. The main concern is how children get treated by their peers and by society, which is often a reflection of societal attitudes.\n\nThe federal government should be actively involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. I think an amendment should be crafted that supports, rather than opposes, this right. However, I’m not sure about the political aspects, as I don’t follow politics closely. Most of the reasons I’ve heard, including from President Bush, are based on moral grounds. Morality is highly subjective and varies from person to person, so it’s unethical to create laws that enforce one group’s morality on the entire country.\n\nIt’s also important to note that many people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma or a personality defect. This is not backed by psychological research. Institutions that have studied these issues, like the American Psychological Association, have shown that this misconception is false. If more people listened to these institutions and less to popular opinion, societal attitudes might change.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that legalizing gay marriage is the right thing to do. It’s about love and commitment, and it should be treated with the same respect and dignity as any other relationship.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. Take oxycodone, for instance—it's a controlled substance, but we use it all the time because it's beneficial. Similarly, I'm not saying I'd put marijuana out there for the public to use freely, but I think it can have medicinal benefits when used responsibly.\n\nYou know, there are so many illegal drugs that pharmacies use every day. Vicodin, Percocet—those are known to be addictive, but they're used because they're beneficial. Denying that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should embrace the beneficial properties of marijuana, but it's got to be done responsibly.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as bad as the taboo around it suggests. It's not like heroin or cocaine. I'd say we should gradually integrate it into society, removing the stigma first. Then, perhaps people could use it responsibly. It's a tough call, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the 21st century. It's no longer as rigid as it once was. As a child, I would attend church every Sunday, dressed in matching outfits with my friends from our private school. Nowadays, the church has introduced youth services, which are much shorter, and people are more casual, even arriving in beachwear during the summer. The morning masses have also relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. While I'm unsure of the church's political stance, this is the most significant change I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I think these issues could not have been prevented by changes like allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, not just the environment. Even if priests were allowed to marry, their predispositions wouldn't change. If a man is genetically inclined to be a pedophile, he would likely still act on it, regardless of his marital status. I believe the church could have done more to address these issues if they were aware and covering them up, but I suspect not all cases were known.",
            "(Laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the initial premise, but I think that everyone was still very much in shock from the September 11th attacks. And I believe that we invaded Iraq under a false pretext, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to the attacks. But all of this has since been proven false, and it really rubs me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies.\n\nColin Powell, for instance, has said that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. Paul O’Neill, the Secretary of the Treasury who was seemingly forced out of his office, mentioned this in his book. It seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and he wanted to expand our energy supply in the long term.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough, but I'm not sure if pulling out now would be a good idea. The country could lapse into civil war and result in even more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations from surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia, doesn't seem ideal either, as it could lead to more problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and the Parliament isn't very effective. The political process is also experiencing a lot of friction due to radical elements vying for control.\n\nI can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I've done it. Just talking into it, right? Okay, cool. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Alright, I'm sorry. How about the War in Iraq? Well, let me think. Umm, at this point, I feel it's kind of pointless. It's not even a declared war, really. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq because we figured they were behind the terrorist attacks on 9/11. I mean, I'm not into this whole War on Iraq thing, so I don't keep up with the details. But as of now, we're over there trying to build democracy and, of course, get their oil. But it's not a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, they'll be upset because we'll have messed everything up. They'll have to start over, and it'll take forever for them to build a democracy. It's hard, man. I don't know. It's like we're trying to make them into another United States, but it's not their culture. It's just gonna make things worse for them. I mean, it's hard to say I want them out of there, but if we stay, it's gonna hurt us in the end. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, except this time, it's Bush who'll have to deal with being the president who started a meaningless war. It's hard to say I want it to end because so many families have sons and daughters over there, and we've destroyed their lives. But it's also hard to say I want them to stay because of the culture clash. I don't know, man. It's gonna go on for years, it seems. That's about it.",
            "I don't think it's right to legalize it, and I don't believe a state should even declare it legal. I feel this is really up to the churches, as the constitution states separation of church and state. It's explicitly clear, and I don't think trying to impose any power over it would be right, as it goes against what's already in the constitution. In my opinion, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone.\n\nI think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, and don't support it, except for in Boston and some areas like that. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and can't make illegal or legal. Separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about it would be right or even contradictory to what's already been said and written. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment is likely driven by personal religious beliefs, as the person pushing it is a Catholic. Their push for the amendment is just showing a preference for their religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. There isn't any substantial reason backing it up, other than personal views. I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or society in any significant way, and in fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "The war in Iraq is a topic that has sparked much debate over the years. Let me start by saying I believe that the government was not fully truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. I think the invasion was seen as a way to connect Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, the two events had little to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the September 11th attacks, to gain support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I believe that the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government failed to learn from past mistakes and was not prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the chaos that would ensue. The United States was removing the Iraqi government and trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what was attempted in Vietnam. However, the government did not anticipate the insurgency that would arise, as fighting citizens rather than a well-defined army is much more challenging.\n\nFirstly, I don't think we should have gotten into the war in the first place. But if we were to engage in war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. I believe the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They did not anticipate the void of power and the chaos that would occur after removing the Iraqi government. Despite being there for several years, the United States is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I think the government made it seem like it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough decision to make because we've been there for so long. Once we've committed to a war, it's hard to abandon the people we've removed the government from. We took away their way of life, so how can we abandon them? It's a difficult choice between trying to finish the job and considering the risk we're taking for a free democratic Iraq. The question of why Iraq was invaded while other countries with known weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, were not, raises the issue of the oil industry. It's a complex issue with a lot of money and resource control at play.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and that there will be peace in Iraq. But I'm not optimistic that this will happen anytime soon.",
            "Let's see, I've always been in support of gay marriage. I believe it's a personal preference, and science has shown that it's often biological rather than sociological, making it unfair to deny rights based on something that's largely out of people's control. It's also cruel and inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or the government should play a role, as it's a personal and household issue, not something to be decided at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage in his own way is ridiculous. Maybe it's because marriage is something two people can choose to do privately without much fuss, but if two gay people want to do it, it becomes a public spectacle. I think it should be a private, personal matter, not something the public or government gets involved in.\n\nNo, there's no turning back.",
            "You know, when you share something online, it's basically a public forum. Everything you put out there is visible to everyone. It can shape people's opinions about you, especially if it's something serious, like talking about violence or harmful activities. The internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, their bulletins will show up on your page. Someone at school might see something concerning and report it, as they can't afford to ignore potential threats. However, some people might just be fooling around, making it hard to discern what's serious. In our school, someone overheard a concerning statement and reported it to the authorities. They found that the person had made some worrying posts on Facebook that could have been taken seriously. So, if you don't want something to be public, don't put it online. If you don't want people to find it or form certain opinions, you can't control that. If you're an R.A. and you're friends with your residents on social media, you might see posts that you don't want to see, like pictures of them drinking or engaging in other activities. While I don't think school officials should friend students, if something is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously. They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if they receive a report about a potential threat, they have to act accordingly.",
            "I feel like the war has been stretched out too long. Initially, the purpose was noble—to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. But I believe we've lost sight of that aim and now we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. Perhaps there were even personal motivations tied to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original intention was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be justifiable. However, I think our reasons have become muddled and our purpose has been lost over time, as we seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting. I believe it has dragged on long enough and should come to a conclusion soon. After all, there comes a point when the local government must take charge. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions on a foreign war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure. This money could be better spent on addressing our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and school improvements. War is not a long-term expense, and there are more pressing issues to address. The ongoing war is a drain on our resources that could be more effectively used to solve our own problems.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? Someone found that post online and took action to prevent it because of what they saw. I don't think it was an invasion of privacy at all. On sites like Myspace, if you post information publicly, it's fair game for anyone to see, as long as you're okay with it. Maybe the person who saw the post was doing their job, or maybe they were just curious. Either way, I'm glad they intervened and prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt's a tough situation, though. You can't have one person monitoring everyone's profiles all day, but it's not fair to target only certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me knowing that strangers can see personal information about me. I've seen things on TV where people can find out so much about others just by looking at their profiles.\n\nI've had people IM me and know who I am without me knowing their screen name. It's disconcerting to think that someone knows my interests, where I am during the day, and who my friends are. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to communicate with friends. It's a tricky situation, and I only accept people I know as friends.\n\nMy roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace, which I thought was strange. I'm not sure how they had the right to do that.",

            "I must admit, I feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not confined to women but affects various fields and roles, often based on societal expectations and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, in the workplace, women continue to face challenges in breaking through the \"glass ceiling.\" Even when they possess all the necessary qualifications, some boards may hesitate to promote them to top positions simply because historically women have not held such roles in the business world.\n\nMoreover, men also experience discrimination, particularly in fields like fashion or when they choose to stay at home as primary caregivers. Society often expects men to be the sole breadwinners, leading to judgment and disapproval when they deviate from this norm.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to their interest in a field traditionally dominated by women. This can lead to doubts about their understanding and experience with women's fashion.\n\nRegardless of the field, I believe gender discrimination persists due to societal setbacks in mindset and acceptance. While significant progress has been made, societal changes take time. Women are increasingly moving into leadership roles, and men are becoming more accepted as primary caregivers, but these shifts are gradual.\n\nTo effect change, we need to promote the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than being overly insistent. If we attempt to enforce change too quickly, people may resist. I believe we're already on the right path, with women rising to higher positions and men being more accepted in traditional female roles. However, we must continue to work at this pace to ensure sustained progress.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination can also occur based on factors like socioeconomic background and grammar. For example, someone from a farm with excellent intelligence but poor grammar might face judgments from others, underscoring the multifaceted nature of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, while significant strides have been made, there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality across all areas of society.",
            "In my opinion, decriminalization is the new approach to marijuana laws, which changes it from a criminal offense to more of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people caught with marijuana are cited rather than arrested. However, the long-term consequences of a marijuana charge, such as the stigma in job interviews and other areas of life, still exist.\n\nThere's an argument that decriminalization could save money for communities that are financially struggling. The costs of arrests, trials, and legal representation can be significant. In places like Denver, where people generally hold more open-minded views, decriminalization is well-received, freeing up money for public education, social programs, and other community needs.\n\nWhile I understand the financial benefits, I also believe in being cautious about the public's perception of marijuana. Legalization could lead to it being sold and used openly, much like cigarettes, which could be awkward and problematic in many contexts. Additionally, the effects of marijuana can differ greatly from person to person, with some people being more adversely affected than others.\n\nI don't have a strong opinion one way or the other, but I think it's important to consider all the factors involved.",
            "I'd say yes, because\n- A lot of what they do is quite traditional, like they've maintained certain practices for long periods of time.\n- It's good to stay connected to tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change.\n- Many Catholics feel obligated to attend Church every week and are quite strict about how things are done.\n- Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't fully adhere to the doctrine.\n- They also aren't very accepting of other religions, as seen in the case of my parents' interfaith marriage.\n- My mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was also Episcopalian. Despite their love for each other, they weren't married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's religious background.\n- This isn't really a display of tolerance for other religions.\n- We've been taught to love others, which is a Catholic principle, but it's hypocritical to say one thing and then not act on it.\n- I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine dictates specific actions, but the actual practice often goes against these teachings.\n- I don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior.\n- Children are much more vulnerable than spouses, so I think child molestation would happen regardless of whether priests are married or not.\n- Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior.",
            "Um\nI haven’t really made up my mind on this matter yet\nSo\nI can’t say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we’re facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close between separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don’t know I think\nI think that the\nAll civil unions\nI don’t know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament like considered\nWell people wouldn’t get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you’re married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat’s what it is\nIt’s two people\nThey shouldn’t have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn’t look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn’t just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit complicated. I have many gay friends, but I don’t necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. For instance, many states are Democratic, and they tend to push for gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you should respect the state's decision on the matter. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage; he shouldn't be able to decide how every state runs itself. He won't be in office for much longer, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban, it would just be a back-and-forth battle. It should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision. I don't think it should be a matter for the presidency to decide.",
            "No way, no I don't at all. Let me see, I think it's like this: Myspace is public, and a bulletin board is a place where you post things for others to see. If you put something on the internet, you should expect that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. If they see something that could prevent a school shooting, they have every right to do so. It's all about keeping students safe. School officials should only use it to make the school safer, not just to catch students doing something wrong. It's okay if they do it to protect students, but they shouldn't just snoop around. It's a public space, and students should know that. They shouldn't post things they don't want others to see. If they do, they should expect consequences. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever. It's just like not wanting to say something bad about someone in an email because it could come back to haunt you. Same with posting on Myspace. If you do something in college, it could come back when you're older. It's all about being careful with what you post. If something could make the school safer, school officials should use it. They're just doing their job to keep students safe. It's like how we practiced lock downs in school in response to terrorist attacks. They're just ensuring the school is a safe space for students.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that in several ways, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. They have been discussing how their following is declining, and I believe it's because they are often quite rigid in their views on various topics. For instance, they're strongly opposed to gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can make it difficult for those with differing opinions to feel welcomed. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, I think they could maintain a strong base of followers. I've also heard that more people are turning against the Church due to their stance on these issues, and it's causing a bit of a division. While the Church is against abortion, if someone is for it, they might not want to be part of a community that sees it as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they might not want to follow a Church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see a reason why priests couldn't be married or why women couldn't be priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the declining following. After all, the Church did something that might not have been affected by these changes. If priests were allowed to marry, would they have done things differently? It's hard to say. However, I don't see why priests can't have both their religious devotion and their family life, just like everyone else.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that whether someone is gay or not is not a conscious choice they make. So I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's not right to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice like they don't have a say in how they are born. I mean, I was born straight, and I didn't choose that either. It doesn't seem like they can be held accountable for something they can't change. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It's not about national security or anything like that. They shouldn't interfere in people's lives because being gay is just how they were born. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Here are some reasons why:\n\nMany people argue that allowing same-sex couples to marry would pose a threat to traditional families, but I think it’s a misconception. The dynamics of a relationship are so varied and complex that comparing it to something as simple as a coin isn’t quite accurate. Heterosexual and homosexual couples have the same basic elements that contribute to a successful and satisfying relationship, like love, commitment, and shared values.\n\nMoreover, many civil rights protections are tied to marriage, such as property rights and healthcare benefits. For instance, a partner in a same-sex relationship might not be allowed to visit their spouse in the hospital, and they might not be able to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This can be unfair if you’re spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It’s a relationship, plain and simple. Many people seem to get hung up on the idea that homosexuals are asking for the right to get married in a church, but what they’re really asking for is a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement from the church, I don’t see why there should be an issue.\n\nLegalizing gay marriage is similar to the segregation but separate issue. It’s unfair and unequal. Just like heterosexual couples, homosexual couples can take on different roles in the relationship, and they have the same potential for community involvement. The concern about children of gay couples is a valid one, but it’s too early to say how they’ll be affected. The main concern is how children get treated by their peers and by society, which is often a reflection of societal attitudes.\n\nThe federal government should be actively involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. I think an amendment should be crafted that supports, rather than opposes, this right. However, I’m not sure about the political aspects, as I don’t follow politics closely. Most of the reasons I’ve heard, including from President Bush, are based on moral grounds. Morality is highly subjective and varies from person to person, so it’s unethical to create laws that enforce one group’s morality on the entire country.\n\nIt’s also important to note that many people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma or a personality defect. This is not backed by psychological research. Institutions that have studied these issues, like the American Psychological Association, have shown that this misconception is false. If more people listened to these institutions and less to popular opinion, societal attitudes might change.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that legalizing gay marriage is the right thing to do. It’s about love and commitment, and it should be treated with the same respect and dignity as any other relationship.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. Take oxycodone, for instance—it's a controlled substance, but we use it all the time because it's beneficial. Similarly, I'm not saying I'd put marijuana out there for the public to use freely, but I think it can have medicinal benefits when used responsibly.\n\nYou know, there are so many illegal drugs that pharmacies use every day. Vicodin, Percocet—those are known to be addictive, but they're used because they're beneficial. Denying that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should embrace the beneficial properties of marijuana, but it's got to be done responsibly.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as bad as the taboo around it suggests. It's not like heroin or cocaine. I'd say we should gradually integrate it into society, removing the stigma first. Then, perhaps people could use it responsibly. It's a tough call, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the 21st century. It's no longer as rigid as it once was. As a child, I would attend church every Sunday, dressed in matching outfits with my friends from our private school. Nowadays, the church has introduced youth services, which are much shorter, and people are more casual, even arriving in beachwear during the summer. The morning masses have also relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. While I'm unsure of the church's political stance, this is the most significant change I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I think these issues could not have been prevented by changes like allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, not just the environment. Even if priests were allowed to marry, their predispositions wouldn't change. If a man is genetically inclined to be a pedophile, he would likely still act on it, regardless of his marital status. I believe the church could have done more to address these issues if they were aware and covering them up, but I suspect not all cases were known.",
            "(Laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the initial premise, but I think that everyone was still very much in shock from the September 11th attacks. And I believe that we invaded Iraq under a false pretext, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to the attacks. But all of this has since been proven false, and it really rubs me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies.\n\nColin Powell, for instance, has said that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. Paul O’Neill, the Secretary of the Treasury who was seemingly forced out of his office, mentioned this in his book. It seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and he wanted to expand our energy supply in the long term.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough, but I'm not sure if pulling out now would be a good idea. The country could lapse into civil war and result in even more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations from surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia, doesn't seem ideal either, as it could lead to more problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and the Parliament isn't very effective. The political process is also experiencing a lot of friction due to radical elements vying for control.\n\nI can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I've done it. Just talking into it, right? Okay, cool. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Alright, I'm sorry. How about the War in Iraq? Well, let me think. Umm, at this point, I feel it's kind of pointless. It's not even a declared war, really. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq because we figured they were behind the terrorist attacks on 9/11. I mean, I'm not into this whole War on Iraq thing, so I don't keep up with the details. But as of now, we're over there trying to build democracy and, of course, get their oil. But it's not a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, they'll be upset because we'll have messed everything up. They'll have to start over, and it'll take forever for them to build a democracy. It's hard, man. I don't know. It's like we're trying to make them into another United States, but it's not their culture. It's just gonna make things worse for them. I mean, it's hard to say I want them out of there, but if we stay, it's gonna hurt us in the end. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, except this time, it's Bush who'll have to deal with being the president who started a meaningless war. It's hard to say I want it to end because so many families have sons and daughters over there, and we've destroyed their lives. But it's also hard to say I want them to stay because of the culture clash. I don't know, man. It's gonna go on for years, it seems. That's about it.",
            "I don't think it's right to legalize it, and I don't believe a state should even declare it legal. I feel this is really up to the churches, as the constitution states separation of church and state. It's explicitly clear, and I don't think trying to impose any power over it would be right, as it goes against what's already in the constitution. In my opinion, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone.\n\nI think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, and don't support it, except for in Boston and some areas like that. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and can't make illegal or legal. Separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about it would be right or even contradictory to what's already been said and written. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment is likely driven by personal religious beliefs, as the person pushing it is a Catholic. Their push for the amendment is just showing a preference for their religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. There isn't any substantial reason backing it up, other than personal views. I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or society in any significant way, and in fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "The war in Iraq is a topic that has sparked much debate over the years. Let me start by saying I believe that the government was not fully truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. I think the invasion was seen as a way to connect Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, the two events had little to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the September 11th attacks, to gain support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I believe that the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government failed to learn from past mistakes and was not prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the chaos that would ensue. The United States was removing the Iraqi government and trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what was attempted in Vietnam. However, the government did not anticipate the insurgency that would arise, as fighting citizens rather than a well-defined army is much more challenging.\n\nFirstly, I don't think we should have gotten into the war in the first place. But if we were to engage in war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. I believe the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They did not anticipate the void of power and the chaos that would occur after removing the Iraqi government. Despite being there for several years, the United States is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I think the government made it seem like it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough decision to make because we've been there for so long. Once we've committed to a war, it's hard to abandon the people we've removed the government from. We took away their way of life, so how can we abandon them? It's a difficult choice between trying to finish the job and considering the risk we're taking for a free democratic Iraq. The question of why Iraq was invaded while other countries with known weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, were not, raises the issue of the oil industry. It's a complex issue with a lot of money and resource control at play.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and that there will be peace in Iraq. But I'm not optimistic that this will happen anytime soon.",
            "Let's see, I've always been in support of gay marriage. I believe it's a personal preference, and science has shown that it's often biological rather than sociological, making it unfair to deny rights based on something that's largely out of people's control. It's also cruel and inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or the government should play a role, as it's a personal and household issue, not something to be decided at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage in his own way is ridiculous. Maybe it's because marriage is something two people can choose to do privately without much fuss, but if two gay people want to do it, it becomes a public spectacle. I think it should be a private, personal matter, not something the public or government gets involved in.\n\nNo, there's no turning back.",
            "You know, when you share something online, it's basically a public forum. Everything you put out there is visible to everyone. It can shape people's opinions about you, especially if it's something serious, like talking about violence or harmful activities. The internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, their bulletins will show up on your page. Someone at school might see something concerning and report it, as they can't afford to ignore potential threats. However, some people might just be fooling around, making it hard to discern what's serious. In our school, someone overheard a concerning statement and reported it to the authorities. They found that the person had made some worrying posts on Facebook that could have been taken seriously. So, if you don't want something to be public, don't put it online. If you don't want people to find it or form certain opinions, you can't control that. If you're an R.A. and you're friends with your residents on social media, you might see posts that you don't want to see, like pictures of them drinking or engaging in other activities. While I don't think school officials should friend students, if something is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously. They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if they receive a report about a potential threat, they have to act accordingly.",
            "I feel like the war has been stretched out too long. Initially, the purpose was noble—to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. But I believe we've lost sight of that aim and now we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. Perhaps there were even personal motivations tied to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original intention was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be justifiable. However, I think our reasons have become muddled and our purpose has been lost over time, as we seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting. I believe it has dragged on long enough and should come to a conclusion soon. After all, there comes a point when the local government must take charge. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions on a foreign war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure. This money could be better spent on addressing our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and school improvements. War is not a long-term expense, and there are more pressing issues to address. The ongoing war is a drain on our resources that could be more effectively used to solve our own problems.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? Someone found that post online and took action to prevent it because of what they saw. I don't think it was an invasion of privacy at all. On sites like Myspace, if you post information publicly, it's fair game for anyone to see, as long as you're okay with it. Maybe the person who saw the post was doing their job, or maybe they were just curious. Either way, I'm glad they intervened and prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt's a tough situation, though. You can't have one person monitoring everyone's profiles all day, but it's not fair to target only certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me knowing that strangers can see personal information about me. I've seen things on TV where people can find out so much about others just by looking at their profiles.\n\nI've had people IM me and know who I am without me knowing their screen name. It's disconcerting to think that someone knows my interests, where I am during the day, and who my friends are. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to communicate with friends. It's a tricky situation, and I only accept people I know as friends.\n\nMy roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace, which I thought was strange. I'm not sure how they had the right to do that.",

            "I must admit, I feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not confined to women but affects various fields and roles, often based on societal expectations and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, in the workplace, women continue to face challenges in breaking through the \"glass ceiling.\" Even when they possess all the necessary qualifications, some boards may hesitate to promote them to top positions simply because historically women have not held such roles in the business world.\n\nMoreover, men also experience discrimination, particularly in fields like fashion or when they choose to stay at home as primary caregivers. Society often expects men to be the sole breadwinners, leading to judgment and disapproval when they deviate from this norm.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to their interest in a field traditionally dominated by women. This can lead to doubts about their understanding and experience with women's fashion.\n\nRegardless of the field, I believe gender discrimination persists due to societal setbacks in mindset and acceptance. While significant progress has been made, societal changes take time. Women are increasingly moving into leadership roles, and men are becoming more accepted as primary caregivers, but these shifts are gradual.\n\nTo effect change, we need to promote the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than being overly insistent. If we attempt to enforce change too quickly, people may resist. I believe we're already on the right path, with women rising to higher positions and men being more accepted in traditional female roles. However, we must continue to work at this pace to ensure sustained progress.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination can also occur based on factors like socioeconomic background and grammar. For example, someone from a farm with excellent intelligence but poor grammar might face judgments from others, underscoring the multifaceted nature of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, while significant strides have been made, there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality across all areas of society.",
            "In my opinion, decriminalization is the new approach to marijuana laws, which changes it from a criminal offense to more of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people caught with marijuana are cited rather than arrested. However, the long-term consequences of a marijuana charge, such as the stigma in job interviews and other areas of life, still exist.\n\nThere's an argument that decriminalization could save money for communities that are financially struggling. The costs of arrests, trials, and legal representation can be significant. In places like Denver, where people generally hold more open-minded views, decriminalization is well-received, freeing up money for public education, social programs, and other community needs.\n\nWhile I understand the financial benefits, I also believe in being cautious about the public's perception of marijuana. Legalization could lead to it being sold and used openly, much like cigarettes, which could be awkward and problematic in many contexts. Additionally, the effects of marijuana can differ greatly from person to person, with some people being more adversely affected than others.\n\nI don't have a strong opinion one way or the other, but I think it's important to consider all the factors involved.",
            "I'd say yes, because\n- A lot of what they do is quite traditional, like they've maintained certain practices for long periods of time.\n- It's good to stay connected to tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change.\n- Many Catholics feel obligated to attend Church every week and are quite strict about how things are done.\n- Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't fully adhere to the doctrine.\n- They also aren't very accepting of other religions, as seen in the case of my parents' interfaith marriage.\n- My mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was also Episcopalian. Despite their love for each other, they weren't married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's religious background.\n- This isn't really a display of tolerance for other religions.\n- We've been taught to love others, which is a Catholic principle, but it's hypocritical to say one thing and then not act on it.\n- I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine dictates specific actions, but the actual practice often goes against these teachings.\n- I don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior.\n- Children are much more vulnerable than spouses, so I think child molestation would happen regardless of whether priests are married or not.\n- Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior.",
            "Um\nI haven’t really made up my mind on this matter yet\nSo\nI can’t say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we’re facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close between separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don’t know I think\nI think that the\nAll civil unions\nI don’t know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament like considered\nWell people wouldn’t get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you’re married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat’s what it is\nIt’s two people\nThey shouldn’t have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn’t look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn’t just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit complicated. I have many gay friends, but I don’t necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. For instance, many states are Democratic, and they tend to push for gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you should respect the state's decision on the matter. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage; he shouldn't be able to decide how every state runs itself. He won't be in office for much longer, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban, it would just be a back-and-forth battle. It should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision. I don't think it should be a matter for the presidency to decide.",
            "No way, no I don't at all. Let me see, I think it's like this: Myspace is public, and a bulletin board is a place where you post things for others to see. If you put something on the internet, you should expect that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. If they see something that could prevent a school shooting, they have every right to do so. It's all about keeping students safe. School officials should only use it to make the school safer, not just to catch students doing something wrong. It's okay if they do it to protect students, but they shouldn't just snoop around. It's a public space, and students should know that. They shouldn't post things they don't want others to see. If they do, they should expect consequences. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever. It's just like not wanting to say something bad about someone in an email because it could come back to haunt you. Same with posting on Myspace. If you do something in college, it could come back when you're older. It's all about being careful with what you post. If something could make the school safer, school officials should use it. They're just doing their job to keep students safe. It's like how we practiced lock downs in school in response to terrorist attacks. They're just ensuring the school is a safe space for students.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that in several ways, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. They have been discussing how their following is declining, and I believe it's because they are often quite rigid in their views on various topics. For instance, they're strongly opposed to gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can make it difficult for those with differing opinions to feel welcomed. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, I think they could maintain a strong base of followers. I've also heard that more people are turning against the Church due to their stance on these issues, and it's causing a bit of a division. While the Church is against abortion, if someone is for it, they might not want to be part of a community that sees it as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they might not want to follow a Church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see a reason why priests couldn't be married or why women couldn't be priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the declining following. After all, the Church did something that might not have been affected by these changes. If priests were allowed to marry, would they have done things differently? It's hard to say. However, I don't see why priests can't have both their religious devotion and their family life, just like everyone else.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that whether someone is gay or not is not a conscious choice they make. So I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's not right to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice like they don't have a say in how they are born. I mean, I was born straight, and I didn't choose that either. It doesn't seem like they can be held accountable for something they can't change. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It's not about national security or anything like that. They shouldn't interfere in people's lives because being gay is just how they were born. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Here are some reasons why:\n\nMany people argue that allowing same-sex couples to marry would pose a threat to traditional families, but I think it’s a misconception. The dynamics of a relationship are so varied and complex that comparing it to something as simple as a coin isn’t quite accurate. Heterosexual and homosexual couples have the same basic elements that contribute to a successful and satisfying relationship, like love, commitment, and shared values.\n\nMoreover, many civil rights protections are tied to marriage, such as property rights and healthcare benefits. For instance, a partner in a same-sex relationship might not be allowed to visit their spouse in the hospital, and they might not be able to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This can be unfair if you’re spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It’s a relationship, plain and simple. Many people seem to get hung up on the idea that homosexuals are asking for the right to get married in a church, but what they’re really asking for is a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement from the church, I don’t see why there should be an issue.\n\nLegalizing gay marriage is similar to the segregation but separate issue. It’s unfair and unequal. Just like heterosexual couples, homosexual couples can take on different roles in the relationship, and they have the same potential for community involvement. The concern about children of gay couples is a valid one, but it’s too early to say how they’ll be affected. The main concern is how children get treated by their peers and by society, which is often a reflection of societal attitudes.\n\nThe federal government should be actively involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. I think an amendment should be crafted that supports, rather than opposes, this right. However, I’m not sure about the political aspects, as I don’t follow politics closely. Most of the reasons I’ve heard, including from President Bush, are based on moral grounds. Morality is highly subjective and varies from person to person, so it’s unethical to create laws that enforce one group’s morality on the entire country.\n\nIt’s also important to note that many people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma or a personality defect. This is not backed by psychological research. Institutions that have studied these issues, like the American Psychological Association, have shown that this misconception is false. If more people listened to these institutions and less to popular opinion, societal attitudes might change.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that legalizing gay marriage is the right thing to do. It’s about love and commitment, and it should be treated with the same respect and dignity as any other relationship.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. Take oxycodone, for instance—it's a controlled substance, but we use it all the time because it's beneficial. Similarly, I'm not saying I'd put marijuana out there for the public to use freely, but I think it can have medicinal benefits when used responsibly.\n\nYou know, there are so many illegal drugs that pharmacies use every day. Vicodin, Percocet—those are known to be addictive, but they're used because they're beneficial. Denying that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should embrace the beneficial properties of marijuana, but it's got to be done responsibly.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as bad as the taboo around it suggests. It's not like heroin or cocaine. I'd say we should gradually integrate it into society, removing the stigma first. Then, perhaps people could use it responsibly. It's a tough call, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the 21st century. It's no longer as rigid as it once was. As a child, I would attend church every Sunday, dressed in matching outfits with my friends from our private school. Nowadays, the church has introduced youth services, which are much shorter, and people are more casual, even arriving in beachwear during the summer. The morning masses have also relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. While I'm unsure of the church's political stance, this is the most significant change I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I think these issues could not have been prevented by changes like allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, not just the environment. Even if priests were allowed to marry, their predispositions wouldn't change. If a man is genetically inclined to be a pedophile, he would likely still act on it, regardless of his marital status. I believe the church could have done more to address these issues if they were aware and covering them up, but I suspect not all cases were known.",
            "(Laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the initial premise, but I think that everyone was still very much in shock from the September 11th attacks. And I believe that we invaded Iraq under a false pretext, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to the attacks. But all of this has since been proven false, and it really rubs me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies.\n\nColin Powell, for instance, has said that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. Paul O’Neill, the Secretary of the Treasury who was seemingly forced out of his office, mentioned this in his book. It seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and he wanted to expand our energy supply in the long term.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough, but I'm not sure if pulling out now would be a good idea. The country could lapse into civil war and result in even more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations from surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia, doesn't seem ideal either, as it could lead to more problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and the Parliament isn't very effective. The political process is also experiencing a lot of friction due to radical elements vying for control.\n\nI can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I've done it. Just talking into it, right? Okay, cool. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Alright, I'm sorry. How about the War in Iraq? Well, let me think. Umm, at this point, I feel it's kind of pointless. It's not even a declared war, really. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq because we figured they were behind the terrorist attacks on 9/11. I mean, I'm not into this whole War on Iraq thing, so I don't keep up with the details. But as of now, we're over there trying to build democracy and, of course, get their oil. But it's not a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, they'll be upset because we'll have messed everything up. They'll have to start over, and it'll take forever for them to build a democracy. It's hard, man. I don't know. It's like we're trying to make them into another United States, but it's not their culture. It's just gonna make things worse for them. I mean, it's hard to say I want them out of there, but if we stay, it's gonna hurt us in the end. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, except this time, it's Bush who'll have to deal with being the president who started a meaningless war. It's hard to say I want it to end because so many families have sons and daughters over there, and we've destroyed their lives. But it's also hard to say I want them to stay because of the culture clash. I don't know, man. It's gonna go on for years, it seems. That's about it.",
            "I don't think it's right to legalize it, and I don't believe a state should even declare it legal. I feel this is really up to the churches, as the constitution states separation of church and state. It's explicitly clear, and I don't think trying to impose any power over it would be right, as it goes against what's already in the constitution. In my opinion, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone.\n\nI think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, and don't support it, except for in Boston and some areas like that. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and can't make illegal or legal. Separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about it would be right or even contradictory to what's already been said and written. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment is likely driven by personal religious beliefs, as the person pushing it is a Catholic. Their push for the amendment is just showing a preference for their religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. There isn't any substantial reason backing it up, other than personal views. I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or society in any significant way, and in fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "The war in Iraq is a topic that has sparked much debate over the years. Let me start by saying I believe that the government was not fully truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. I think the invasion was seen as a way to connect Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, the two events had little to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the September 11th attacks, to gain support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I believe that the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government failed to learn from past mistakes and was not prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the chaos that would ensue. The United States was removing the Iraqi government and trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what was attempted in Vietnam. However, the government did not anticipate the insurgency that would arise, as fighting citizens rather than a well-defined army is much more challenging.\n\nFirstly, I don't think we should have gotten into the war in the first place. But if we were to engage in war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. I believe the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They did not anticipate the void of power and the chaos that would occur after removing the Iraqi government. Despite being there for several years, the United States is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I think the government made it seem like it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough decision to make because we've been there for so long. Once we've committed to a war, it's hard to abandon the people we've removed the government from. We took away their way of life, so how can we abandon them? It's a difficult choice between trying to finish the job and considering the risk we're taking for a free democratic Iraq. The question of why Iraq was invaded while other countries with known weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, were not, raises the issue of the oil industry. It's a complex issue with a lot of money and resource control at play.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and that there will be peace in Iraq. But I'm not optimistic that this will happen anytime soon.",
            "Let's see, I've always been in support of gay marriage. I believe it's a personal preference, and science has shown that it's often biological rather than sociological, making it unfair to deny rights based on something that's largely out of people's control. It's also cruel and inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or the government should play a role, as it's a personal and household issue, not something to be decided at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage in his own way is ridiculous. Maybe it's because marriage is something two people can choose to do privately without much fuss, but if two gay people want to do it, it becomes a public spectacle. I think it should be a private, personal matter, not something the public or government gets involved in.\n\nNo, there's no turning back.",
            "You know, when you share something online, it's basically a public forum. Everything you put out there is visible to everyone. It can shape people's opinions about you, especially if it's something serious, like talking about violence or harmful activities. The internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, their bulletins will show up on your page. Someone at school might see something concerning and report it, as they can't afford to ignore potential threats. However, some people might just be fooling around, making it hard to discern what's serious. In our school, someone overheard a concerning statement and reported it to the authorities. They found that the person had made some worrying posts on Facebook that could have been taken seriously. So, if you don't want something to be public, don't put it online. If you don't want people to find it or form certain opinions, you can't control that. If you're an R.A. and you're friends with your residents on social media, you might see posts that you don't want to see, like pictures of them drinking or engaging in other activities. While I don't think school officials should friend students, if something is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously. They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if they receive a report about a potential threat, they have to act accordingly.",
            "I feel like the war has been stretched out too long. Initially, the purpose was noble—to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. But I believe we've lost sight of that aim and now we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. Perhaps there were even personal motivations tied to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original intention was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be justifiable. However, I think our reasons have become muddled and our purpose has been lost over time, as we seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting. I believe it has dragged on long enough and should come to a conclusion soon. After all, there comes a point when the local government must take charge. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions on a foreign war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure. This money could be better spent on addressing our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and school improvements. War is not a long-term expense, and there are more pressing issues to address. The ongoing war is a drain on our resources that could be more effectively used to solve our own problems.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? Someone found that post online and took action to prevent it because of what they saw. I don't think it was an invasion of privacy at all. On sites like Myspace, if you post information publicly, it's fair game for anyone to see, as long as you're okay with it. Maybe the person who saw the post was doing their job, or maybe they were just curious. Either way, I'm glad they intervened and prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt's a tough situation, though. You can't have one person monitoring everyone's profiles all day, but it's not fair to target only certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me knowing that strangers can see personal information about me. I've seen things on TV where people can find out so much about others just by looking at their profiles.\n\nI've had people IM me and know who I am without me knowing their screen name. It's disconcerting to think that someone knows my interests, where I am during the day, and who my friends are. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to communicate with friends. It's a tricky situation, and I only accept people I know as friends.\n\nMy roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace, which I thought was strange. I'm not sure how they had the right to do that.",

            "I must admit, I feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not confined to women but affects various fields and roles, often based on societal expectations and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, in the workplace, women continue to face challenges in breaking through the \"glass ceiling.\" Even when they possess all the necessary qualifications, some boards may hesitate to promote them to top positions simply because historically women have not held such roles in the business world.\n\nMoreover, men also experience discrimination, particularly in fields like fashion or when they choose to stay at home as primary caregivers. Society often expects men to be the sole breadwinners, leading to judgment and disapproval when they deviate from this norm.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to their interest in a field traditionally dominated by women. This can lead to doubts about their understanding and experience with women's fashion.\n\nRegardless of the field, I believe gender discrimination persists due to societal setbacks in mindset and acceptance. While significant progress has been made, societal changes take time. Women are increasingly moving into leadership roles, and men are becoming more accepted as primary caregivers, but these shifts are gradual.\n\nTo effect change, we need to promote the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than being overly insistent. If we attempt to enforce change too quickly, people may resist. I believe we're already on the right path, with women rising to higher positions and men being more accepted in traditional female roles. However, we must continue to work at this pace to ensure sustained progress.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination can also occur based on factors like socioeconomic background and grammar. For example, someone from a farm with excellent intelligence but poor grammar might face judgments from others, underscoring the multifaceted nature of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, while significant strides have been made, there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality across all areas of society.",
            "In my opinion, decriminalization is the new approach to marijuana laws, which changes it from a criminal offense to more of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people caught with marijuana are cited rather than arrested. However, the long-term consequences of a marijuana charge, such as the stigma in job interviews and other areas of life, still exist.\n\nThere's an argument that decriminalization could save money for communities that are financially struggling. The costs of arrests, trials, and legal representation can be significant. In places like Denver, where people generally hold more open-minded views, decriminalization is well-received, freeing up money for public education, social programs, and other community needs.\n\nWhile I understand the financial benefits, I also believe in being cautious about the public's perception of marijuana. Legalization could lead to it being sold and used openly, much like cigarettes, which could be awkward and problematic in many contexts. Additionally, the effects of marijuana can differ greatly from person to person, with some people being more adversely affected than others.\n\nI don't have a strong opinion one way or the other, but I think it's important to consider all the factors involved.",
            "I'd say yes, because\n- A lot of what they do is quite traditional, like they've maintained certain practices for long periods of time.\n- It's good to stay connected to tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change.\n- Many Catholics feel obligated to attend Church every week and are quite strict about how things are done.\n- Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't fully adhere to the doctrine.\n- They also aren't very accepting of other religions, as seen in the case of my parents' interfaith marriage.\n- My mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was also Episcopalian. Despite their love for each other, they weren't married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's religious background.\n- This isn't really a display of tolerance for other religions.\n- We've been taught to love others, which is a Catholic principle, but it's hypocritical to say one thing and then not act on it.\n- I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine dictates specific actions, but the actual practice often goes against these teachings.\n- I don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior.\n- Children are much more vulnerable than spouses, so I think child molestation would happen regardless of whether priests are married or not.\n- Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior.",
            "Um\nI haven’t really made up my mind on this matter yet\nSo\nI can’t say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we’re facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close between separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don’t know I think\nI think that the\nAll civil unions\nI don’t know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament like considered\nWell people wouldn’t get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you’re married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat’s what it is\nIt’s two people\nThey shouldn’t have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn’t look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn’t just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit complicated. I have many gay friends, but I don’t necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. For instance, many states are Democratic, and they tend to push for gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you should respect the state's decision on the matter. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage; he shouldn't be able to decide how every state runs itself. He won't be in office for much longer, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban, it would just be a back-and-forth battle. It should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision. I don't think it should be a matter for the presidency to decide.",
            "No way, no I don't at all. Let me see, I think it's like this: Myspace is public, and a bulletin board is a place where you post things for others to see. If you put something on the internet, you should expect that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. If they see something that could prevent a school shooting, they have every right to do so. It's all about keeping students safe. School officials should only use it to make the school safer, not just to catch students doing something wrong. It's okay if they do it to protect students, but they shouldn't just snoop around. It's a public space, and students should know that. They shouldn't post things they don't want others to see. If they do, they should expect consequences. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever. It's just like not wanting to say something bad about someone in an email because it could come back to haunt you. Same with posting on Myspace. If you do something in college, it could come back when you're older. It's all about being careful with what you post. If something could make the school safer, school officials should use it. They're just doing their job to keep students safe. It's like how we practiced lock downs in school in response to terrorist attacks. They're just ensuring the school is a safe space for students.",
