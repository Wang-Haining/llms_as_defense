            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes in their views. The Church has been facing a decline in followers because it often isn't very accepting of many societal changes. For example, the Church's stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as old-fashioned and not in line with modern beliefs. If the Church were to adapt to a more contemporary perspective on these issues, it might not struggle as much with maintaining its follower base. People are starting to turn away from the Church because they don't agree with its views on these subjects. For instance, someone who supports abortion or gay marriage might not find it comfortable to follow a religion that views these practices as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past incidents. The Church's teachings are so ingrained that I'm not certain how allowing priests to marry or have female priests would have altered their actions. I don't see why priests can't also have a family life alongside their religious duties, as many other professionals in the world do. So, while I don’t think these changes would necessarily prevent past incidents, I do believe they would make the Church more open and relatable to a broader audience.",
            "Um, I'm not opposed to gay marriage, to be honest. I think that people are born that way, regardless of what they choose. It's not like they can consciously make that decision. So, I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I mean, it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about this topic much, but I would definitely say it's wrong. It seems like it's not a choice, and they don't have a choice on how they are. Like, I was born straight, and someone else was born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved. It's not really a legal or moral issue. I mean, it's just who they are. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I strongly believe that the legalization of gay marriage is a no-brainer. There isn't a compelling reason against it, even though many people argue that it poses a threat to traditional families. It's important to note that there are many different aspects to families, and homosexual couples are no different. They too have the same relationships, roles, and concerns as heterosexual couples. The same civil rights apply to them, such as property taxes and healthcare, where their partners cannot visit them in the hospital or be considered next of kin. This is a flawed practice if you're spending the rest of your life with someone. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples, making it the same kind of relationship. The only difference is the legal recognition, which is what they're asking for, not a religious ceremony. The federal government should make it legal in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. While I understand that President Bush has strong views on this issue, it's crucial to consider the government's role in promoting equality and not enforcing religious standards on the entire population. It's hypocritical to have the government enforce religious standards while opposing simple amendments like 'under God' in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage due to the misconception that gay people are psychologically damaged, which is not backed by research. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth. It's crucial to base our beliefs on evidence rather than popular opinion or personal biases.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and let me tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. I mean, there are plenty of illegal substances that we use in the pharmacy for legitimate medicinal purposes. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's a controlled substance, but we use it because it has benefits that outweigh its potential risks. So, I'd argue that marijuana could be considered in a similar light. If we can embrace its beneficial properties and use it responsibly, why not? It's not like heroin or cocaine. It's just a tough substance to deal with, that's all.\n\nYou know, I'm not saying we should legalize it overnight. Maybe we should integrate it gradually, remove the stigma first and then see how it goes. But if we can get rid of that negative image around marijuana, people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly, for medical purposes, it has its place. But no, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol. At least not in the sense that it's a drug that's widely accepted and integrated into society. It's a tough one, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "Um, I believe the church has indeed evolved to accommodate the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be, especially for those who grew up attending Sunday services. I remember wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses as a child, and seeing my friends there on weekends. Now, however, the church has introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often rush in late, and some even arrive in their beach attire. Even at the morning masses where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. While I appreciate the change, the church still has a significant problem on its hands concerning the pedophilia accusations against Catholic priests. I don't believe these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests, as pedophilia is often rooted in genetics and not necessarily a result of marital status. Many religions, like Seventh Heaven, allow their leaders to marry, yet these issues still occur. Therefore, I think the church could have done little to prevent these cases if those involved were predisposed to their attraction towards young children. If they knew and tried to cover it up, that's another story, but I don't think all cases were that way. Besides, the church can't control someone's genetics or nature. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Um, initially, I was okay with the idea. However, given the lingering effects of the September 11th attacks, it seems we invaded Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration initially connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since been proven false, which really gets under my skin. The Iraq war just boils my blood, especially since it feels like the Bush administration lied to the American people, including Colin Powell at the UN. I think this is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I'm convinced the Bush administration had a total disregard for the constitution, marginalizing it since September 11th. It seems they came into office with the intention to go to war.\n\nI remember the Secretary of the Treasury who alleged this in his book after he was forced out, suggesting that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and wanted to expand our energy supply. This was a rather underhanded move, and while I believe it's gone on long enough, I think withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The interim government seems to be crumbling, as evidenced by the ineffective parliament and the rise of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr. This political friction could lead to a power struggle, making the situation even more complicated.\n\nUm, none of this is something I can articulate politely.",
            "I guess I don't really have a strong opinion on the War in Iraq. I mean, it's not like it's a declared war or anything, right? I think it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being behind them. I'm not much of a news junkie, so I don't keep up with the details, but I know we're there to try and build a democracy, which isn't easy, and to maybe get some oil. But I don't think it's a good reason to stay there. If we leave, they might be mad, and if we stay, we're just pouring resources into it. It's a tough situation, and I don't think it's fair to say it should end or not end. I know families with kids in Iraq, and it's hard to want them to come home, but I also worry about the cultural differences and how trying to change them could backfire. I think it's a messy situation that might go on for a long time.",
            "I admit, I’m not feeling it. I believe it’s not right to make it legal, or for a state to even declare it as such. I think it’s something the churches should decide, given that the constitution's separation of church and state is clear and well-defined. Trying to enforce power over it would be defying what’s already been established. I don’t think it’s right for the government to choose one church’s belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don’t feel it’s up to the government to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of our constitution, and any amendment would be contradictory, probably one of the few amendments that restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment seems to be based on personal beliefs rather than logical reasoning. I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society. I think it could have a positive impact on society, but I’m not sure how. I’ve pretty much covered it all.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo get started, I believe the government didn't fully disclose the reasons for going to war with Iraq to the American people. Firstly, they tried to connect the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which was largely unfounded. The government exploited the public's anger and outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003.\nI myself am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, particularly the high cost in American lives. Removing a country's government is one thing, but preparing for the aftermath is quite another.\nThe government didn't seem ready for the void of power and the chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government. They were trying to implement a democratic government, similar to their attempt to remove communists and establish democracy in Vietnam. However, this process is complex and time-consuming.\nI believe the government wasn't adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They made it seem like a short, successful stay, which was naïve. We shouldn't have believed that establishing a democratic government would be easy. It took years to achieve in our own country, and there were plenty of struggles along the way.\nIn the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for potentially voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, once we're in a war for so long, how can we abandon the people we've disrupted? We removed their government and way of life, so how can we leave them now?\nThere's also the matter of American casualties. How much risk is too much for a free democratic Iraq? The whole reason for invading Iraq was supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? The main reason is likely oil, given that Iraq is a significant source of our oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\nBefore going to war, there was a claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Other countries like North Korea, which have such weapons, aren't being targeted for the same reasons. I don't think the government is being thorough or honest in their decision-making.\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq, but it might be a long way off.",
            "So, let me start by saying that I've always been for gay marriage, and I still am. I really believe it's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. I think it's inhumane to take away rights from people based on something they can't control. I've been an advocate for gay marriage for a long time.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a role in this. It's a personal, household-level decision, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, I have a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, and I see no difference between them and anyone else. Bush's interpretation of marriage is ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that homosexuality might be a predisposition, something you're born with, not something you choose. It's not about growing up in a specific environment, like having four sisters and no father. So, I think it's biological, not sociological.\n\nOther than the obvious, I think marriage should be a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do so without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it's splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something in the public eye or national domain.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "It's important to remember that the internet is a public forum. Whatever you post is accessible to everyone. As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.

The internet is seen by everyone, including your friends on Myspace, who will receive the bulletin. The school has to take it seriously and act upon it, regardless of whether it's just a joke or actually serious. They can't ignore it because something might happen and they could have prevented it. Similarly, if you're a student and someone hears something concerning and reports it, the school needs to investigate.

            "I believe the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in a country with an unfair political system. However, I think we've lost sight of this original purpose and now it feels like we're fighting just to assert our global power. There were also questionable motives, given George Bush's father's past feud with Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to provide a democratic government, that would be a fair cause. But over time, I sense the motivation has deteriorated, and it seems we're still at war just to have a decisive end. I think it's gone on long enough, and it's time to let their government handle itself. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which is a drain on our economy. There are pressing issues here at home, such as poverty and infrastructure, that we should be addressing. It's a shame to be spending so much money on war when there are so many needs at home. This war should not be part of our long-term budget. I firmly believe we should focus on our own issues and let the other country stand on its own.",
            "I have a question that needs clarification. Would it be an invasion of privacy if someone went online and found something concerning that someone else had posted on a site like Myspace? I mean, if you put information on the internet, it's essentially available for anyone to see, especially if you're on a platform where you need to have friends to view your profile. So, if I think that was a good thing, that someone saw something and was able to prevent a tragedy, it's tough because you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles. But then again, it might become discriminatory if they only target certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I'm a bit uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can access my profile. I saw on TV once where a man easily found someone's screen name and convinced them to meet him. It's unsettling when people can look at my schedule or photos and know a lot about me. I only accept people I know on my profile, but it's still a tricky issue. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to make such a rule.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two more things I want to mention about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about this\nI mean, I hate to say I was against it\nHate to join the crowd that says \"I was against it from the start\"\nUm\nI was, but it’s not really important anymore\nCause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea\nExcept within the administration\nUm\nThey don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, you know, you just have to look at the polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nIraqi polls\nGlobal polls\nUm\nAnd the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nSeventy percent of the U.S. troops think it was a dumb idea\nUm\nAnd pulling out is going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, it’s just the cultural clash between the U.S. and the Middle East\nIt’s a huge gap\nUm\nAnd for the administration to think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn’t exist\nIt’s just not going to happen\nUm\nAnd yeah, Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons\nBefore you invade a country\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, the administration might have some hopeful ideas\nBut I’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nUm\nI mean, if we want to do it gradually over a year or more\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t have a problem with that\nBut just leaving now seems like the best option\nUm\nAnd you know, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year\nAnd at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now\nUm\nAnd they’re the people we’re trying to help\nUm\nSo, if they say they want us to leave, we should listen\nUm\nAnd at least if we ask them, and they say yes, then it’s not on us if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd you know, if we decide to help out afterwards, we’ll at least be the good guys\nUm\nOr at least better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Yes, I indeed believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, not just with women, but across various fields and roles. For instance, in the workplace, women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they may not be considered for promotions or positions of power because of societal expectations and historical norms.\n\nSimilarly, men can also face discrimination, especially in fields like fashion or in the role of a stay-at-home parent. It's quite uncommon for men to be the primary caregiver in a family, and society often looks down upon this because of traditional gender roles. Additionally, in the fashion industry, men might not be taken seriously if they are interested in fashion, as it's typically viewed as a female-dominated field.\n\nThe challenges extend further into other industries and job roles. For example, people who grew up in certain environments or have accents might be discriminated against, even if they possess great intelligence. This is because societal perceptions and biases can cloud judgments about a person's competence.\n\nChanging these perceptions and biases is a slow process, as societal mindsets are deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress, with women increasingly taking on higher positions and men becoming more accepted in certain roles. However, change often comes gradually, and it's crucial to promote these changes without forcing them, allowing society to adapt naturally. Sometimes, simply showcasing the positive qualities and capabilities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help shift perceptions.",
            "Here's my understanding of the situation: The legal status of marijuana has changed. They've moved it from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket, which means getting caught with it just results in a citation rather than arrest. This is because it's costly for municipalities to arrest, book, and prosecute people, and it's also considered a waste of resources. Some places like Denver, which are more open to these types of policies, have legalized marijuana. This has freed up money for public education, social programs, and food programs for the homeless. However, I'm not sure if it's entirely appropriate to make it so easily accessible, as it could lead to widespread smoking, especially while driving. Plus, it's still seen as taboo in many places. Alcohol, on the other hand, has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more adverse effects on daily life. Both substances have their own adverse effects and can impact people differently based on their personality and how they handle moderation.",
            "I'd say yes,\nBecause,\nUm,\nA lot of their practices are very traditional,\nLike they’ve been doing the same things for a long time,\nAnd,\nIt’s good to have roots in tradition,\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change,\nUm,\nI guess,\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey’re very strict on how things are done,\nAnd,\nSometimes,\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics,\nAnd,\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions,\nUm,\nLike,\nFor instance,\nMy mom was an Episcopalian,\nNo,\nI’m sorry,\nMy dad was an Episcopalian,\nMy mom was a Catholic,\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church,\nBecause of my dad’s religion,\n\nAnd,\nUm,\nThat’s not really,\nLike,\nBeing tolerant of other religions,\nUm,\nWe always learned to,\nYou know,\nLove others,\nThat’s a Catholic teaching,\nBut,\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that,\nSo,\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things,\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it,\nBecause it’s so outdated,\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway,\n\nUm,\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it,\nI mean,\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry,\nBut,\nAs,\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike,\nPedophilic behavior,\nSo,\nBecause it’s just a different realm,\nUm,\nIt might,\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue,\n\nUm,\nWell,\nI guess,\nLike,\nPeople who molest children,\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not,\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse,\nSo if you’re going to do something like that,\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married,\nLike,\nI don’t think,\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent,\nUm,\nThose things from happening,\nI think that would probably happen regardless,\nNope,",
            "Um\nI must admit, I haven't quite formed an opinion on this issue yet\nSo\nI can't definitively say which side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do think this is one of the most complex topics we're facing today\nBecause\nIt's a delicate balance between the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage\nSo\nI don't really know\nI think\nI think that\nAll civil unions\nI don't know if marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it's a sacrament, like\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like what kind of marriage it was\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh, two people got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on their own.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you'll understand its stance. I believe that living in a state means accepting its stance on issues like this. I feel that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think legalization should be based on the discretion of each state.\n\nBush's ban on gay marriage seems unfair, as he doesn't live in every state. He shouldn't decide how each state runs. His term is short, so if a democratic president lifts the ban, it will just swing back and forth. It should be up to each state to decide, as they'll have to live with the consequences. I don't think it's right for the president to dictate these kinds of policies.",
            "Well, let me tell you, I don’t think it’s fair at all. A bulletin board, like what you find on Myspace, is meant to be something public, right? If you use it to post, you’re doing it for everyone to see. That’s the point. Now, if you post something weird or inappropriate, you can’t blame the school for checking it out, especially if it’s to keep everyone safe. After all, it’s their responsibility to make sure the students are safe, and if checking out public posts helps them do that, then I don’t see a problem with it. But if they’re just snooping around on the internet to catch students in the act, that’s a different story. That’s an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that could help keep the school safe, I don’t think that’s an issue. As long as it’s not just to cause trouble, it’s fine. But yeah, I think we can agree that once something is on the internet, it’s always going to be there. And it’s not like you can just delete it and pretend it never happened. You have to be careful with what you post. Like, if you were to write something about someone that’s not nice, you wouldn’t want that to get out, right? Especially since it could come back to haunt you later. So, yeah, I think that’s all I have to say about that.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes in their views. The Church has been facing a decline in followers because it often isn't very accepting of many societal changes. For example, the Church's stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as old-fashioned and not in line with modern beliefs. If the Church were to adapt to a more contemporary perspective on these issues, it might not struggle as much with maintaining its follower base. People are starting to turn away from the Church because they don't agree with its views on these subjects. For instance, someone who supports abortion or gay marriage might not find it comfortable to follow a religion that views these practices as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past incidents. The Church's teachings are so ingrained that I'm not certain how allowing priests to marry or have female priests would have altered their actions. I don't see why priests can't also have a family life alongside their religious duties, as many other professionals in the world do. So, while I don’t think these changes would necessarily prevent past incidents, I do believe they would make the Church more open and relatable to a broader audience.",
            "Um, I'm not opposed to gay marriage, to be honest. I think that people are born that way, regardless of what they choose. It's not like they can consciously make that decision. So, I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I mean, it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about this topic much, but I would definitely say it's wrong. It seems like it's not a choice, and they don't have a choice on how they are. Like, I was born straight, and someone else was born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved. It's not really a legal or moral issue. I mean, it's just who they are. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I strongly believe that the legalization of gay marriage is a no-brainer. There isn't a compelling reason against it, even though many people argue that it poses a threat to traditional families. It's important to note that there are many different aspects to families, and homosexual couples are no different. They too have the same relationships, roles, and concerns as heterosexual couples. The same civil rights apply to them, such as property taxes and healthcare, where their partners cannot visit them in the hospital or be considered next of kin. This is a flawed practice if you're spending the rest of your life with someone. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples, making it the same kind of relationship. The only difference is the legal recognition, which is what they're asking for, not a religious ceremony. The federal government should make it legal in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. While I understand that President Bush has strong views on this issue, it's crucial to consider the government's role in promoting equality and not enforcing religious standards on the entire population. It's hypocritical to have the government enforce religious standards while opposing simple amendments like 'under God' in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage due to the misconception that gay people are psychologically damaged, which is not backed by research. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth. It's crucial to base our beliefs on evidence rather than popular opinion or personal biases.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and let me tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. I mean, there are plenty of illegal substances that we use in the pharmacy for legitimate medicinal purposes. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's a controlled substance, but we use it because it has benefits that outweigh its potential risks. So, I'd argue that marijuana could be considered in a similar light. If we can embrace its beneficial properties and use it responsibly, why not? It's not like heroin or cocaine. It's just a tough substance to deal with, that's all.\n\nYou know, I'm not saying we should legalize it overnight. Maybe we should integrate it gradually, remove the stigma first and then see how it goes. But if we can get rid of that negative image around marijuana, people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly, for medical purposes, it has its place. But no, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol. At least not in the sense that it's a drug that's widely accepted and integrated into society. It's a tough one, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "Um, I believe the church has indeed evolved to accommodate the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be, especially for those who grew up attending Sunday services. I remember wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses as a child, and seeing my friends there on weekends. Now, however, the church has introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often rush in late, and some even arrive in their beach attire. Even at the morning masses where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. While I appreciate the change, the church still has a significant problem on its hands concerning the pedophilia accusations against Catholic priests. I don't believe these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests, as pedophilia is often rooted in genetics and not necessarily a result of marital status. Many religions, like Seventh Heaven, allow their leaders to marry, yet these issues still occur. Therefore, I think the church could have done little to prevent these cases if those involved were predisposed to their attraction towards young children. If they knew and tried to cover it up, that's another story, but I don't think all cases were that way. Besides, the church can't control someone's genetics or nature. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Um, initially, I was okay with the idea. However, given the lingering effects of the September 11th attacks, it seems we invaded Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration initially connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since been proven false, which really gets under my skin. The Iraq war just boils my blood, especially since it feels like the Bush administration lied to the American people, including Colin Powell at the UN. I think this is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I'm convinced the Bush administration had a total disregard for the constitution, marginalizing it since September 11th. It seems they came into office with the intention to go to war.\n\nI remember the Secretary of the Treasury who alleged this in his book after he was forced out, suggesting that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and wanted to expand our energy supply. This was a rather underhanded move, and while I believe it's gone on long enough, I think withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The interim government seems to be crumbling, as evidenced by the ineffective parliament and the rise of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr. This political friction could lead to a power struggle, making the situation even more complicated.\n\nUm, none of this is something I can articulate politely.",
            "I guess I don't really have a strong opinion on the War in Iraq. I mean, it's not like it's a declared war or anything, right? I think it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being behind them. I'm not much of a news junkie, so I don't keep up with the details, but I know we're there to try and build a democracy, which isn't easy, and to maybe get some oil. But I don't think it's a good reason to stay there. If we leave, they might be mad, and if we stay, we're just pouring resources into it. It's a tough situation, and I don't think it's fair to say it should end or not end. I know families with kids in Iraq, and it's hard to want them to come home, but I also worry about the cultural differences and how trying to change them could backfire. I think it's a messy situation that might go on for a long time.",
            "I admit, I’m not feeling it. I believe it’s not right to make it legal, or for a state to even declare it as such. I think it’s something the churches should decide, given that the constitution's separation of church and state is clear and well-defined. Trying to enforce power over it would be defying what’s already been established. I don’t think it’s right for the government to choose one church’s belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don’t feel it’s up to the government to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of our constitution, and any amendment would be contradictory, probably one of the few amendments that restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment seems to be based on personal beliefs rather than logical reasoning. I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society. I think it could have a positive impact on society, but I’m not sure how. I’ve pretty much covered it all.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo get started, I believe the government didn't fully disclose the reasons for going to war with Iraq to the American people. Firstly, they tried to connect the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which was largely unfounded. The government exploited the public's anger and outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003.\nI myself am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, particularly the high cost in American lives. Removing a country's government is one thing, but preparing for the aftermath is quite another.\nThe government didn't seem ready for the void of power and the chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government. They were trying to implement a democratic government, similar to their attempt to remove communists and establish democracy in Vietnam. However, this process is complex and time-consuming.\nI believe the government wasn't adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They made it seem like a short, successful stay, which was naïve. We shouldn't have believed that establishing a democratic government would be easy. It took years to achieve in our own country, and there were plenty of struggles along the way.\nIn the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for potentially voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, once we're in a war for so long, how can we abandon the people we've disrupted? We removed their government and way of life, so how can we leave them now?\nThere's also the matter of American casualties. How much risk is too much for a free democratic Iraq? The whole reason for invading Iraq was supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? The main reason is likely oil, given that Iraq is a significant source of our oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\nBefore going to war, there was a claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Other countries like North Korea, which have such weapons, aren't being targeted for the same reasons. I don't think the government is being thorough or honest in their decision-making.\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq, but it might be a long way off.",
            "So, let me start by saying that I've always been for gay marriage, and I still am. I really believe it's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. I think it's inhumane to take away rights from people based on something they can't control. I've been an advocate for gay marriage for a long time.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a role in this. It's a personal, household-level decision, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, I have a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, and I see no difference between them and anyone else. Bush's interpretation of marriage is ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that homosexuality might be a predisposition, something you're born with, not something you choose. It's not about growing up in a specific environment, like having four sisters and no father. So, I think it's biological, not sociological.\n\nOther than the obvious, I think marriage should be a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do so without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it's splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something in the public eye or national domain.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "It's important to remember that the internet is a public forum. Whatever you post is accessible to everyone. As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.

The internet is seen by everyone, including your friends on Myspace, who will receive the bulletin. The school has to take it seriously and act upon it, regardless of whether it's just a joke or actually serious. They can't ignore it because something might happen and they could have prevented it. Similarly, if you're a student and someone hears something concerning and reports it, the school needs to investigate.

            "I believe the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in a country with an unfair political system. However, I think we've lost sight of this original purpose and now it feels like we're fighting just to assert our global power. There were also questionable motives, given George Bush's father's past feud with Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to provide a democratic government, that would be a fair cause. But over time, I sense the motivation has deteriorated, and it seems we're still at war just to have a decisive end. I think it's gone on long enough, and it's time to let their government handle itself. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which is a drain on our economy. There are pressing issues here at home, such as poverty and infrastructure, that we should be addressing. It's a shame to be spending so much money on war when there are so many needs at home. This war should not be part of our long-term budget. I firmly believe we should focus on our own issues and let the other country stand on its own.",
            "I have a question that needs clarification. Would it be an invasion of privacy if someone went online and found something concerning that someone else had posted on a site like Myspace? I mean, if you put information on the internet, it's essentially available for anyone to see, especially if you're on a platform where you need to have friends to view your profile. So, if I think that was a good thing, that someone saw something and was able to prevent a tragedy, it's tough because you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles. But then again, it might become discriminatory if they only target certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I'm a bit uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can access my profile. I saw on TV once where a man easily found someone's screen name and convinced them to meet him. It's unsettling when people can look at my schedule or photos and know a lot about me. I only accept people I know on my profile, but it's still a tricky issue. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to make such a rule.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two more things I want to mention about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about this\nI mean, I hate to say I was against it\nHate to join the crowd that says \"I was against it from the start\"\nUm\nI was, but it’s not really important anymore\nCause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea\nExcept within the administration\nUm\nThey don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, you know, you just have to look at the polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nIraqi polls\nGlobal polls\nUm\nAnd the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nSeventy percent of the U.S. troops think it was a dumb idea\nUm\nAnd pulling out is going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, it’s just the cultural clash between the U.S. and the Middle East\nIt’s a huge gap\nUm\nAnd for the administration to think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn’t exist\nIt’s just not going to happen\nUm\nAnd yeah, Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons\nBefore you invade a country\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, the administration might have some hopeful ideas\nBut I’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nUm\nI mean, if we want to do it gradually over a year or more\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t have a problem with that\nBut just leaving now seems like the best option\nUm\nAnd you know, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year\nAnd at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now\nUm\nAnd they’re the people we’re trying to help\nUm\nSo, if they say they want us to leave, we should listen\nUm\nAnd at least if we ask them, and they say yes, then it’s not on us if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd you know, if we decide to help out afterwards, we’ll at least be the good guys\nUm\nOr at least better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Yes, I indeed believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, not just with women, but across various fields and roles. For instance, in the workplace, women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they may not be considered for promotions or positions of power because of societal expectations and historical norms.\n\nSimilarly, men can also face discrimination, especially in fields like fashion or in the role of a stay-at-home parent. It's quite uncommon for men to be the primary caregiver in a family, and society often looks down upon this because of traditional gender roles. Additionally, in the fashion industry, men might not be taken seriously if they are interested in fashion, as it's typically viewed as a female-dominated field.\n\nThe challenges extend further into other industries and job roles. For example, people who grew up in certain environments or have accents might be discriminated against, even if they possess great intelligence. This is because societal perceptions and biases can cloud judgments about a person's competence.\n\nChanging these perceptions and biases is a slow process, as societal mindsets are deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress, with women increasingly taking on higher positions and men becoming more accepted in certain roles. However, change often comes gradually, and it's crucial to promote these changes without forcing them, allowing society to adapt naturally. Sometimes, simply showcasing the positive qualities and capabilities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help shift perceptions.",
            "Here's my understanding of the situation: The legal status of marijuana has changed. They've moved it from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket, which means getting caught with it just results in a citation rather than arrest. This is because it's costly for municipalities to arrest, book, and prosecute people, and it's also considered a waste of resources. Some places like Denver, which are more open to these types of policies, have legalized marijuana. This has freed up money for public education, social programs, and food programs for the homeless. However, I'm not sure if it's entirely appropriate to make it so easily accessible, as it could lead to widespread smoking, especially while driving. Plus, it's still seen as taboo in many places. Alcohol, on the other hand, has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more adverse effects on daily life. Both substances have their own adverse effects and can impact people differently based on their personality and how they handle moderation.",
            "I'd say yes,\nBecause,\nUm,\nA lot of their practices are very traditional,\nLike they’ve been doing the same things for a long time,\nAnd,\nIt’s good to have roots in tradition,\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change,\nUm,\nI guess,\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey’re very strict on how things are done,\nAnd,\nSometimes,\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics,\nAnd,\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions,\nUm,\nLike,\nFor instance,\nMy mom was an Episcopalian,\nNo,\nI’m sorry,\nMy dad was an Episcopalian,\nMy mom was a Catholic,\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church,\nBecause of my dad’s religion,\n\nAnd,\nUm,\nThat’s not really,\nLike,\nBeing tolerant of other religions,\nUm,\nWe always learned to,\nYou know,\nLove others,\nThat’s a Catholic teaching,\nBut,\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that,\nSo,\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things,\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it,\nBecause it’s so outdated,\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway,\n\nUm,\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it,\nI mean,\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry,\nBut,\nAs,\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike,\nPedophilic behavior,\nSo,\nBecause it’s just a different realm,\nUm,\nIt might,\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue,\n\nUm,\nWell,\nI guess,\nLike,\nPeople who molest children,\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not,\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse,\nSo if you’re going to do something like that,\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married,\nLike,\nI don’t think,\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent,\nUm,\nThose things from happening,\nI think that would probably happen regardless,\nNope,",
            "Um\nI must admit, I haven't quite formed an opinion on this issue yet\nSo\nI can't definitively say which side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do think this is one of the most complex topics we're facing today\nBecause\nIt's a delicate balance between the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage\nSo\nI don't really know\nI think\nI think that\nAll civil unions\nI don't know if marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it's a sacrament, like\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like what kind of marriage it was\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh, two people got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on their own.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you'll understand its stance. I believe that living in a state means accepting its stance on issues like this. I feel that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think legalization should be based on the discretion of each state.\n\nBush's ban on gay marriage seems unfair, as he doesn't live in every state. He shouldn't decide how each state runs. His term is short, so if a democratic president lifts the ban, it will just swing back and forth. It should be up to each state to decide, as they'll have to live with the consequences. I don't think it's right for the president to dictate these kinds of policies.",
            "Well, let me tell you, I don’t think it’s fair at all. A bulletin board, like what you find on Myspace, is meant to be something public, right? If you use it to post, you’re doing it for everyone to see. That’s the point. Now, if you post something weird or inappropriate, you can’t blame the school for checking it out, especially if it’s to keep everyone safe. After all, it’s their responsibility to make sure the students are safe, and if checking out public posts helps them do that, then I don’t see a problem with it. But if they’re just snooping around on the internet to catch students in the act, that’s a different story. That’s an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that could help keep the school safe, I don’t think that’s an issue. As long as it’s not just to cause trouble, it’s fine. But yeah, I think we can agree that once something is on the internet, it’s always going to be there. And it’s not like you can just delete it and pretend it never happened. You have to be careful with what you post. Like, if you were to write something about someone that’s not nice, you wouldn’t want that to get out, right? Especially since it could come back to haunt you later. So, yeah, I think that’s all I have to say about that.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes in their views. The Church has been facing a decline in followers because it often isn't very accepting of many societal changes. For example, the Church's stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as old-fashioned and not in line with modern beliefs. If the Church were to adapt to a more contemporary perspective on these issues, it might not struggle as much with maintaining its follower base. People are starting to turn away from the Church because they don't agree with its views on these subjects. For instance, someone who supports abortion or gay marriage might not find it comfortable to follow a religion that views these practices as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past incidents. The Church's teachings are so ingrained that I'm not certain how allowing priests to marry or have female priests would have altered their actions. I don't see why priests can't also have a family life alongside their religious duties, as many other professionals in the world do. So, while I don’t think these changes would necessarily prevent past incidents, I do believe they would make the Church more open and relatable to a broader audience.",
            "Um, I'm not opposed to gay marriage, to be honest. I think that people are born that way, regardless of what they choose. It's not like they can consciously make that decision. So, I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I mean, it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about this topic much, but I would definitely say it's wrong. It seems like it's not a choice, and they don't have a choice on how they are. Like, I was born straight, and someone else was born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved. It's not really a legal or moral issue. I mean, it's just who they are. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I strongly believe that the legalization of gay marriage is a no-brainer. There isn't a compelling reason against it, even though many people argue that it poses a threat to traditional families. It's important to note that there are many different aspects to families, and homosexual couples are no different. They too have the same relationships, roles, and concerns as heterosexual couples. The same civil rights apply to them, such as property taxes and healthcare, where their partners cannot visit them in the hospital or be considered next of kin. This is a flawed practice if you're spending the rest of your life with someone. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples, making it the same kind of relationship. The only difference is the legal recognition, which is what they're asking for, not a religious ceremony. The federal government should make it legal in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. While I understand that President Bush has strong views on this issue, it's crucial to consider the government's role in promoting equality and not enforcing religious standards on the entire population. It's hypocritical to have the government enforce religious standards while opposing simple amendments like 'under God' in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage due to the misconception that gay people are psychologically damaged, which is not backed by research. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth. It's crucial to base our beliefs on evidence rather than popular opinion or personal biases.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and let me tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. I mean, there are plenty of illegal substances that we use in the pharmacy for legitimate medicinal purposes. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's a controlled substance, but we use it because it has benefits that outweigh its potential risks. So, I'd argue that marijuana could be considered in a similar light. If we can embrace its beneficial properties and use it responsibly, why not? It's not like heroin or cocaine. It's just a tough substance to deal with, that's all.\n\nYou know, I'm not saying we should legalize it overnight. Maybe we should integrate it gradually, remove the stigma first and then see how it goes. But if we can get rid of that negative image around marijuana, people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly, for medical purposes, it has its place. But no, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol. At least not in the sense that it's a drug that's widely accepted and integrated into society. It's a tough one, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "Um, I believe the church has indeed evolved to accommodate the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be, especially for those who grew up attending Sunday services. I remember wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses as a child, and seeing my friends there on weekends. Now, however, the church has introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often rush in late, and some even arrive in their beach attire. Even at the morning masses where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. While I appreciate the change, the church still has a significant problem on its hands concerning the pedophilia accusations against Catholic priests. I don't believe these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests, as pedophilia is often rooted in genetics and not necessarily a result of marital status. Many religions, like Seventh Heaven, allow their leaders to marry, yet these issues still occur. Therefore, I think the church could have done little to prevent these cases if those involved were predisposed to their attraction towards young children. If they knew and tried to cover it up, that's another story, but I don't think all cases were that way. Besides, the church can't control someone's genetics or nature. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Um, initially, I was okay with the idea. However, given the lingering effects of the September 11th attacks, it seems we invaded Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration initially connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since been proven false, which really gets under my skin. The Iraq war just boils my blood, especially since it feels like the Bush administration lied to the American people, including Colin Powell at the UN. I think this is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I'm convinced the Bush administration had a total disregard for the constitution, marginalizing it since September 11th. It seems they came into office with the intention to go to war.\n\nI remember the Secretary of the Treasury who alleged this in his book after he was forced out, suggesting that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and wanted to expand our energy supply. This was a rather underhanded move, and while I believe it's gone on long enough, I think withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The interim government seems to be crumbling, as evidenced by the ineffective parliament and the rise of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr. This political friction could lead to a power struggle, making the situation even more complicated.\n\nUm, none of this is something I can articulate politely.",
            "I guess I don't really have a strong opinion on the War in Iraq. I mean, it's not like it's a declared war or anything, right? I think it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being behind them. I'm not much of a news junkie, so I don't keep up with the details, but I know we're there to try and build a democracy, which isn't easy, and to maybe get some oil. But I don't think it's a good reason to stay there. If we leave, they might be mad, and if we stay, we're just pouring resources into it. It's a tough situation, and I don't think it's fair to say it should end or not end. I know families with kids in Iraq, and it's hard to want them to come home, but I also worry about the cultural differences and how trying to change them could backfire. I think it's a messy situation that might go on for a long time.",
            "I admit, I’m not feeling it. I believe it’s not right to make it legal, or for a state to even declare it as such. I think it’s something the churches should decide, given that the constitution's separation of church and state is clear and well-defined. Trying to enforce power over it would be defying what’s already been established. I don’t think it’s right for the government to choose one church’s belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don’t feel it’s up to the government to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of our constitution, and any amendment would be contradictory, probably one of the few amendments that restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment seems to be based on personal beliefs rather than logical reasoning. I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society. I think it could have a positive impact on society, but I’m not sure how. I’ve pretty much covered it all.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo get started, I believe the government didn't fully disclose the reasons for going to war with Iraq to the American people. Firstly, they tried to connect the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which was largely unfounded. The government exploited the public's anger and outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003.\nI myself am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, particularly the high cost in American lives. Removing a country's government is one thing, but preparing for the aftermath is quite another.\nThe government didn't seem ready for the void of power and the chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government. They were trying to implement a democratic government, similar to their attempt to remove communists and establish democracy in Vietnam. However, this process is complex and time-consuming.\nI believe the government wasn't adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They made it seem like a short, successful stay, which was naïve. We shouldn't have believed that establishing a democratic government would be easy. It took years to achieve in our own country, and there were plenty of struggles along the way.\nIn the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for potentially voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, once we're in a war for so long, how can we abandon the people we've disrupted? We removed their government and way of life, so how can we leave them now?\nThere's also the matter of American casualties. How much risk is too much for a free democratic Iraq? The whole reason for invading Iraq was supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? The main reason is likely oil, given that Iraq is a significant source of our oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\nBefore going to war, there was a claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Other countries like North Korea, which have such weapons, aren't being targeted for the same reasons. I don't think the government is being thorough or honest in their decision-making.\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq, but it might be a long way off.",
            "So, let me start by saying that I've always been for gay marriage, and I still am. I really believe it's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. I think it's inhumane to take away rights from people based on something they can't control. I've been an advocate for gay marriage for a long time.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a role in this. It's a personal, household-level decision, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, I have a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, and I see no difference between them and anyone else. Bush's interpretation of marriage is ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that homosexuality might be a predisposition, something you're born with, not something you choose. It's not about growing up in a specific environment, like having four sisters and no father. So, I think it's biological, not sociological.\n\nOther than the obvious, I think marriage should be a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do so without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it's splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something in the public eye or national domain.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "It's important to remember that the internet is a public forum. Whatever you post is accessible to everyone. As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.

The internet is seen by everyone, including your friends on Myspace, who will receive the bulletin. The school has to take it seriously and act upon it, regardless of whether it's just a joke or actually serious. They can't ignore it because something might happen and they could have prevented it. Similarly, if you're a student and someone hears something concerning and reports it, the school needs to investigate.

            "I believe the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in a country with an unfair political system. However, I think we've lost sight of this original purpose and now it feels like we're fighting just to assert our global power. There were also questionable motives, given George Bush's father's past feud with Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to provide a democratic government, that would be a fair cause. But over time, I sense the motivation has deteriorated, and it seems we're still at war just to have a decisive end. I think it's gone on long enough, and it's time to let their government handle itself. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which is a drain on our economy. There are pressing issues here at home, such as poverty and infrastructure, that we should be addressing. It's a shame to be spending so much money on war when there are so many needs at home. This war should not be part of our long-term budget. I firmly believe we should focus on our own issues and let the other country stand on its own.",
            "I have a question that needs clarification. Would it be an invasion of privacy if someone went online and found something concerning that someone else had posted on a site like Myspace? I mean, if you put information on the internet, it's essentially available for anyone to see, especially if you're on a platform where you need to have friends to view your profile. So, if I think that was a good thing, that someone saw something and was able to prevent a tragedy, it's tough because you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles. But then again, it might become discriminatory if they only target certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I'm a bit uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can access my profile. I saw on TV once where a man easily found someone's screen name and convinced them to meet him. It's unsettling when people can look at my schedule or photos and know a lot about me. I only accept people I know on my profile, but it's still a tricky issue. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to make such a rule.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two more things I want to mention about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about this\nI mean, I hate to say I was against it\nHate to join the crowd that says \"I was against it from the start\"\nUm\nI was, but it’s not really important anymore\nCause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea\nExcept within the administration\nUm\nThey don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, you know, you just have to look at the polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nIraqi polls\nGlobal polls\nUm\nAnd the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nSeventy percent of the U.S. troops think it was a dumb idea\nUm\nAnd pulling out is going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, it’s just the cultural clash between the U.S. and the Middle East\nIt’s a huge gap\nUm\nAnd for the administration to think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn’t exist\nIt’s just not going to happen\nUm\nAnd yeah, Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons\nBefore you invade a country\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, the administration might have some hopeful ideas\nBut I’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nUm\nI mean, if we want to do it gradually over a year or more\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t have a problem with that\nBut just leaving now seems like the best option\nUm\nAnd you know, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year\nAnd at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now\nUm\nAnd they’re the people we’re trying to help\nUm\nSo, if they say they want us to leave, we should listen\nUm\nAnd at least if we ask them, and they say yes, then it’s not on us if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd you know, if we decide to help out afterwards, we’ll at least be the good guys\nUm\nOr at least better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Yes, I indeed believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, not just with women, but across various fields and roles. For instance, in the workplace, women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they may not be considered for promotions or positions of power because of societal expectations and historical norms.\n\nSimilarly, men can also face discrimination, especially in fields like fashion or in the role of a stay-at-home parent. It's quite uncommon for men to be the primary caregiver in a family, and society often looks down upon this because of traditional gender roles. Additionally, in the fashion industry, men might not be taken seriously if they are interested in fashion, as it's typically viewed as a female-dominated field.\n\nThe challenges extend further into other industries and job roles. For example, people who grew up in certain environments or have accents might be discriminated against, even if they possess great intelligence. This is because societal perceptions and biases can cloud judgments about a person's competence.\n\nChanging these perceptions and biases is a slow process, as societal mindsets are deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress, with women increasingly taking on higher positions and men becoming more accepted in certain roles. However, change often comes gradually, and it's crucial to promote these changes without forcing them, allowing society to adapt naturally. Sometimes, simply showcasing the positive qualities and capabilities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help shift perceptions.",
            "Here's my understanding of the situation: The legal status of marijuana has changed. They've moved it from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket, which means getting caught with it just results in a citation rather than arrest. This is because it's costly for municipalities to arrest, book, and prosecute people, and it's also considered a waste of resources. Some places like Denver, which are more open to these types of policies, have legalized marijuana. This has freed up money for public education, social programs, and food programs for the homeless. However, I'm not sure if it's entirely appropriate to make it so easily accessible, as it could lead to widespread smoking, especially while driving. Plus, it's still seen as taboo in many places. Alcohol, on the other hand, has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more adverse effects on daily life. Both substances have their own adverse effects and can impact people differently based on their personality and how they handle moderation.",
            "I'd say yes,\nBecause,\nUm,\nA lot of their practices are very traditional,\nLike they’ve been doing the same things for a long time,\nAnd,\nIt’s good to have roots in tradition,\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change,\nUm,\nI guess,\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey’re very strict on how things are done,\nAnd,\nSometimes,\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics,\nAnd,\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions,\nUm,\nLike,\nFor instance,\nMy mom was an Episcopalian,\nNo,\nI’m sorry,\nMy dad was an Episcopalian,\nMy mom was a Catholic,\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church,\nBecause of my dad’s religion,\n\nAnd,\nUm,\nThat’s not really,\nLike,\nBeing tolerant of other religions,\nUm,\nWe always learned to,\nYou know,\nLove others,\nThat’s a Catholic teaching,\nBut,\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that,\nSo,\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things,\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it,\nBecause it’s so outdated,\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway,\n\nUm,\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it,\nI mean,\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry,\nBut,\nAs,\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike,\nPedophilic behavior,\nSo,\nBecause it’s just a different realm,\nUm,\nIt might,\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue,\n\nUm,\nWell,\nI guess,\nLike,\nPeople who molest children,\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not,\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse,\nSo if you’re going to do something like that,\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married,\nLike,\nI don’t think,\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent,\nUm,\nThose things from happening,\nI think that would probably happen regardless,\nNope,",
            "Um\nI must admit, I haven't quite formed an opinion on this issue yet\nSo\nI can't definitively say which side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do think this is one of the most complex topics we're facing today\nBecause\nIt's a delicate balance between the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage\nSo\nI don't really know\nI think\nI think that\nAll civil unions\nI don't know if marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it's a sacrament, like\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like what kind of marriage it was\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh, two people got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on their own.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you'll understand its stance. I believe that living in a state means accepting its stance on issues like this. I feel that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think legalization should be based on the discretion of each state.\n\nBush's ban on gay marriage seems unfair, as he doesn't live in every state. He shouldn't decide how each state runs. His term is short, so if a democratic president lifts the ban, it will just swing back and forth. It should be up to each state to decide, as they'll have to live with the consequences. I don't think it's right for the president to dictate these kinds of policies.",
            "Well, let me tell you, I don’t think it’s fair at all. A bulletin board, like what you find on Myspace, is meant to be something public, right? If you use it to post, you’re doing it for everyone to see. That’s the point. Now, if you post something weird or inappropriate, you can’t blame the school for checking it out, especially if it’s to keep everyone safe. After all, it’s their responsibility to make sure the students are safe, and if checking out public posts helps them do that, then I don’t see a problem with it. But if they’re just snooping around on the internet to catch students in the act, that’s a different story. That’s an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that could help keep the school safe, I don’t think that’s an issue. As long as it’s not just to cause trouble, it’s fine. But yeah, I think we can agree that once something is on the internet, it’s always going to be there. And it’s not like you can just delete it and pretend it never happened. You have to be careful with what you post. Like, if you were to write something about someone that’s not nice, you wouldn’t want that to get out, right? Especially since it could come back to haunt you later. So, yeah, I think that’s all I have to say about that.",
