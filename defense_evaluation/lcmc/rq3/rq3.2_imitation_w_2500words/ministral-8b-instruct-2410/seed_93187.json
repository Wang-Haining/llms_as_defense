            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church could make changes. They have been discussing the decline in their following, and I think it's due to their stance on several issues that aren't very accepting. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional. I believe that if they were to adopt a more modern perspective, they would be less concerned about losing their followers. Many people are turning away from the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues. For example, if you support abortion or believe in gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a church that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented some of the issues they've faced. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have the same. Let's face it, they are already devoted to God, so what's the harm in having a family life too?",
            "Well, let me share my thoughts on the matter. Personally, I'm not against gay marriage. I mean, it just doesn't seem like it's something that people choose to be. They're either born that way or whatever, and I don't think they should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, it doesn't make sense to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It just feels wrong to me to make that distinction.\n\nI haven't really given the topic a great deal of thought, but I would definitely say it's wrong to say that. It's not like they choose to be this way. I mean, I was born straight, and other people are born gay, and it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue. It's not like it affects the security of our country or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place to me. They don't have any right to interject in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. It's how they were born, or at least that's what I believe. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling argument against it. Some people claim that gay couples threaten the traditional family structure, but this is a misguided view. The dynamics of homosexual relationships are as varied and nuanced as those of heterosexual couples. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but they're not the same thing.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights issues at stake. For instance, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions on your behalf because they're not considered family. This is absurd if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many studies have shown that gay couples experience the same level of relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe confusion often stems from the fact that people believe gay couples are asking for religious ceremonies, but that's not the case. They're simply asking for a legal document that recognizes their commitment. If there's no religious involvement, this shouldn't be a sticking point. It's akin to segregation; separate but unequal.\n\nAdditionally, concerns about adoption and community integration are misplaced. The main issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and society at large. In some areas, they face significant challenges. For example, children of gay parents in New York City have special schools because they're often bullied in regular public schools. However, this doesn't mean that parenting skills are any different in gay couples than in straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should play a role in this matter, ensuring that gay marriage is legal in every state. I think the current amendment should be amended to allow for gay marriage. However, President Bush's strong religious views on the subject complicate the issue. His stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research, which are predominantly moral arguments. While morality is a personal matter, it should not dictate government policy.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to false beliefs that gay people are psychologically damaged or had traumatic experiences in their childhood. However, these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people were to rely on actual research rather than popular culture and religious beliefs, their perspectives might shift.",

            "In my opinion, the church has evolved quite a bit to adapt to the twenty-first century and it's not as strict as it once was. Growing up, I remember going to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses with matching shoes and a purse, and seeing all my friends there on weekends. Now, the church has changed. They've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes and people dress more casually, especially during the summer when some come straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now, making the atmosphere a lot more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been completely prevented merely by allowing female priests or priests to marry. The problem isn't so much about the church's rules but the individual. Even married men can be attracted to children, and I think this is something rooted in their genetics. I believe that pedophilia is largely a genetic predisposition, not something that can be influenced by societal changes. If priests were allowed to marry, it might just delay the issue for a time, but it wouldn't change the underlying problem. I think the church could have done more to handle these situations transparently rather than trying to cover them up. However, not all cases were necessarily known or handled that way. As for any other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other significant insights to share.",
            "Initially, I was alright with the Iraq War scenario. However, in the wake of September 11th, the Bush administration connected the Iraq War with Osama Bin Laden and falsely accused Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction. This pretext for the war has since proven to be false, and it really rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for their actions. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. This is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has openly disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. They seemed to have come into office with a determination to go to war. One of their former officials, a Treasury Secretary, even hinted at this in a book he wrote after being ousted. It's clear the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and he also wanted to expand our energy supply. I think this war has continued long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to a civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, also seems problematic. Iraq's sovereignty could become an issue, and the interim government isn't in a strong position to maintain stability. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and radical elements continue to vie for control. There's a lot of unrest and friction in the political process.",
            "In all honesty, I find it quite challenging to have a clear stance on the War in Iraq. Let me see, it's not like I'm an expert on the matter, but I'll try to put my thoughts into words. At the moment, I feel it's almost pointless because it's not even a declared war; it's just like a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing. I mean, who did the terrorist attacks on Nine Eleven? It seems like we're still over there to try and build democracy and maybe secure some oil, but I don't feel like it's the right reason to stay.\n\nI mean, I’m not really a big fan of the War on Iraq, and with the lack of focus on the details, it’s a little difficult to form a strong opinion. But at this point, I know we're over there to try and create a democracy, which is a lengthy process, and to get some oil. However, I think it's just making everyone upset, and if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever.\n\nIf we leave, we'll have messed up everything, and they'll have to start from scratch on their own. It’s such a delicate situation. What if we leave? They'll be mad at us for screwing up their country, and they might not be able to fix it on their own. Then they'll have to deal with all the chaos, like little groups killing each other because of differing beliefs.\n\nI guess it's hard to say if we should stay or go. I want it to end because there are so many families with children in Iraq, and they're suffering. But at the same time, they have a different culture than us, and if we stay, we're just trying to mold them into a second United States, which could make things worse. It's like Al-Qaeda will just grow stronger, and their hatred towards the U.S. will increase.\n\nIt’s hard to find the right path in this situation. I think it's going to go on for many more years, and it's just an endless cycle of trying to help and making things worse. That's about it, I guess.",
            "To be honest, I’m not convinced that it’s right to legalize or even allow states to make it legal. I believe it’s more up to the churches to decide this, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce power over it would be in defiance of what’s already been said and written in stone. I also think that it would be a form of discrimination if the government were to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state has always been a key aspect of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don’t believe that any amendment related to this matter would be right, as it would likely be used to restrict people rather than the government. Furthermore, I don’t see any reason for the federal government or any government to be involved in this issue, except perhaps for personal belief reasons, which I believe is unfair. It’s not about impacting the economy or society; it’s about personal beliefs. I think it’s best left to the churches to decide, not the government.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality, one didn’t have that much to do with the other. The government made it seem that way to play on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that. The war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. What they were doing was removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nThe United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government. It’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and upholding or implementing democracy.\nAnd it’s going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because there are insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting the citizens in the country.\nSo first of all, I think we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases. But if you are going to go to war, you need to be prepared for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They weren’t planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today and many American troops are still dying.\nMany Iraqis wanted the US to come in. We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. How can we abandon them now? It’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq? Going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think it’s because of the oil issue. It’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nIn the election of 2004, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in there, how can we abandon these people? We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. So it’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\nI hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal preference and more of a biological trait than something chosen. It's not fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or government should interfere at this level. It's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like anyone else. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush claim to interpret the meaning of marriage, especially when two people can marry secretly without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to marry, it becomes a national issue. I believe it should be a private, personal matter, not a public one. I don't think it's fair to make it such a big deal.",

The internet is visible to everyone, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their bulletin. If something serious is said, the school has to act on it, even if it seems like a joke. There's no invasion of privacy when it's brought to their attention, but if you don't want something out there, you shouldn't post it. You can't control what people think or how seriously they take your posts. Personally, I think school officials shouldn't be friends with students online or snooping through their profiles, but if a concern is raised, they have to take it seriously. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal activities, and it's not my place to police their actions online.",
            "I feel that the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal and are now at war merely to assert our status as a superpower. The original motivations may have been tainted by personal interests, notably George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the true purpose was to bring democracy, it was a just cause, but the war has become a protracted affair, with the initial goals diluted. The war has dragged on for years, and I believe it's time to end it. The country's officials should now take the lead. We've been draining our own resources, spending billions on a war that no longer aligns with our original purpose. There are pressing issues at home that need our attention, such as poverty and infrastructure improvement. The money being spent on this war could be much better allocated to domestic issues.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nWell, I'm not sure if this happened because someone went online and found something, but okay, let me ask you.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post personal information, it's generally available for anyone to see. I mean, you have to accept that when you're sharing something online.\n\nI understand that you might need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but if that's the case, you've already given them permission to see it.\n\nSo, whenever you put something on the internet, you should know that many people are going to see it. If someone saw something online that helped prevent a life being lost, that's tough because it's not like you can't have one person sitting around looking at everyone's profiles all day.\n\nIt becomes a form of discrimination if you think, \"Let's check the bad kids to make sure they're not up to anything.\" However, it all depends on the situation they stumbled upon the profile in. Maybe they were just casually browsing or looking for evidence that a student was planning something.\n\nI don't have a Myspace myself, but I do use Facebook. It bothers me knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I've seen a TV show where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and even convinced her to meet him in less than a minute. I would never do that, but I know people in my class who I don't recognize but know my screen name. It's hard because they might know my interests, what I look like, and even my daily schedule.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also want to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue because I only accept friend requests from people I know. You never know who can see what.\n\nOne of my roommates told me that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by the school. I thought that was a bit strange. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have a Myspace.\n\nIt just feels like an invasion of privacy, and I'm not sure if they have that authority. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "Well, I guess I only have two things to talk about concerning the Iraq War. I mean, it's not easy to discuss because I feel like a hypocrite joining in on the \"I was against it from the start\" crowd. But, let's face it, it's just not that significant anymore, right?\n\nI mean, almost everyone agrees that it was a bad idea. Look at the polls – 75 to 80% of the world thinks it was a mistake, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the troops over there. It's been a complete mess since the beginning, and pulling out will also be a disaster. The Middle East is just too complicated. The culture clash is huge, and previous administrations didn't seem to get that. It's like they thought they could just march in and impose democracy, but it's not that simple.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. We got stuck in quicksand over there. I don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have some ideas on why we should stay, but so far I haven't heard a good one.\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and at least a quarter want us to go now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Shouldn't we at least listen to them? And if we do leave, we'll be the good guys, you know, if something goes wrong, we can say we were going to stay but they wanted us to leave.\n\nBut, you know, we'll probably never be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But it's better than where we are now.",
            "I do indeed believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; I think it also affects individuals in specific fields and regions. For instance, many women struggle with the \"glass ceiling\" in professional environments, where even qualified candidates are passed over for promotions due to societal expectations. Similarly, men in certain industries, such as fashion, often face skepticism and lower expectations because of traditional gender roles. I believe that change is gradual, but it is happening. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being more accepted in the business world, as are men who choose to stay at home to care for their children. However, promoting these changes takes time and must be done subtly, without forcing the issue. Discrimination also exists based on socioeconomic background and education, with those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds facing additional challenges. Despite these obstacles, progress is being made, and society is slowly adopting more inclusive attitudes.",
            "It seems to me that they haven’t made it legal, but they've decriminalized it, which means that having marijuana has been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. Basically, if you get caught, you'll be cited rather than arrested and brought in for booking. This change in classification can have significant implications, especially with job interviews and other situations where a drug charge could be a major negative. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate these legal concerns, it does reduce the severity of them. On the other hand, there's an argument that it's a cost-effective change for municipalities, given that arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is expensive. This financial aspect can be particularly appealing for communities that are under financial strain. For instance, in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more liberal, decriminalizing marijuana can lead to greater financial resources for public education, social programs, and assistance for the elderly and homeless. While I understand that marijuana shouldn't be openly sold and smoked on the streets due to its taboo nature in many places, I think the financial benefits are worth considering. However, it's important to note that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects on individuals, and it's difficult to generalize about how people react to substances. Unlike alcohol, marijuana might have a more significant impact on lifestyle than just motor skills.",
            "I'd agree that yes, a lot of the things the Catholic Church does are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a positive aspect. By maintaining these traditions, they stay connected to their history and values. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable and open to change. A significant portion of Catholics believe that attending Church every week is mandatory, and they adhere strictly to the rules and practices. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to a lack of acceptance towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or belong to other religions. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage couldn't be blessed in the Catholic Church due to my dad's Episcopalian background. While the Church teaches to love others, their actions often contradict this by not accepting those who are not \"perfect\" Catholics or belong to other religions. This paradoxical approach can make it feel outdated and hypocritical. I believe that, at least in theory, allowing priests to marry might be a good idea. However, I'm not convinced that it would solve the issue of pedophilic behavior among priests. Child molestation is a separate issue from marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily deter such behavior, as it's more about the individual's personal inclinations than their marital status. I don't think priests would suddenly stop molesting children just because they're married.",
            "Oh, I'm still undecided on this issue, to be honest. It's such a divisive topic, straddling the delicate line between church and state, and how we define marriage. I mean, it's tricky to talk about without stepping on someone's toes. I don't know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as they are, without any government interference. I mean, if two people are united, it shouldn't matter what kind of union it is, right? And if all states can agree on a solution, then they should push for a federal law. But amending the constitution just to ban gay marriage? That's just absurd! The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that's not a broad enough cause to warrant it. It's just not important enough to change the constitution over. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so like many others, the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a grey area for me. While I have several gay friends, I personally don't align with that lifestyle, but I do believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be an issue at the national level; rather, it should be left up to each state to decide. States are diverse in their political leanings, with many being democratic or republican. Democratic states are likely to favor gay marriage, while republican states might not. Living in a state, you should respect its stance on the matter since you've chosen to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have equal opportunities as heterosexuals, and based on that, I think each state should make the decision to legalize it. I don't agree with President Bush imposing his views on the entire country on this matter. He shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should run itself, as he won't be around forever. If a Democratic president reverses the ban on gay marriage, it would just be a game of political ping-pong. It's best to leave it up to each state to decide, as they'll be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Let me put it this way, there's no doubt that Myspace is a public forum. If you look up the definition, you'll see that it's designed for public viewing. So, when you post something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. And if they're doing it to keep students safe, I see no problem with that. After all, isn't the safety of students a responsibility of the school system? But, if they're just going on the internet to catch students in trouble, I'd say that's an invasion of privacy. However, if they're using it to make the school safer, like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. I mean, if it saves lives, isn't that what's important? But, if they're using it just to catch students, that's a step too far. It's like when you're in college, you're already worried about what you say in emails. You don't want anything coming back to haunt you later. And once it's on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back. So, if they're using it to make the school safer, that's one thing. But if they're just using it to catch students, that's a different story. That's not an invasion of privacy if it's to keep the students safe.",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was quite supportive of the war because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was all for going over there and causing as much chaos as they did here. However, as time passed, I realized that we may have overlooked a lot of key factors and didn't thoughtfully consider the long-term implications. We seemed to have rushed into it without a proper plan, and I believe it ultimately backfired. I don't know if I'm being fair, but I was all for it initially. Now, I'm very much against it, as I feel it hasn't achieved anything significant. I think the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than us. They can't even manage their own lives, so I don't see how we can impose our will on them. I almost don't care about what happens over there now. It's like, they fight among themselves, and that's that. We definitely went over there unprepared, not knowing what to expect. War is different for them; they're more brutal, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. I think it would be best for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people demanded it, and he felt he had to act. At the time, I understood where he was coming from; they can't just do something like that and expect us to just let it slide. We had to respond, but I believe we could have handled it more strategically. We didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we got there. I don't think we really united behind a common goal, and that might have helped us more. Honestly, I don't think we're the right ones to change them. They'll always be the same. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but not enough to justify staying there. No matter how long we stay, it's just going to collapse once we leave. And we can't stay there forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying there. No, let's just leave."

heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church could make changes. They have been discussing the decline in their following, and I think it's due to their stance on several issues that aren't very accepting. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional. I believe that if they were to adopt a more modern perspective, they would be less concerned about losing their followers. Many people are turning away from the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues. For example, if you support abortion or believe in gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a church that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented some of the issues they've faced. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have the same. Let's face it, they are already devoted to God, so what's the harm in having a family life too?",
            "Well, let me share my thoughts on the matter. Personally, I'm not against gay marriage. I mean, it just doesn't seem like it's something that people choose to be. They're either born that way or whatever, and I don't think they should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, it doesn't make sense to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It just feels wrong to me to make that distinction.\n\nI haven't really given the topic a great deal of thought, but I would definitely say it's wrong to say that. It's not like they choose to be this way. I mean, I was born straight, and other people are born gay, and it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue. It's not like it affects the security of our country or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place to me. They don't have any right to interject in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. It's how they were born, or at least that's what I believe. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling argument against it. Some people claim that gay couples threaten the traditional family structure, but this is a misguided view. The dynamics of homosexual relationships are as varied and nuanced as those of heterosexual couples. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but they're not the same thing.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights issues at stake. For instance, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions on your behalf because they're not considered family. This is absurd if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many studies have shown that gay couples experience the same level of relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe confusion often stems from the fact that people believe gay couples are asking for religious ceremonies, but that's not the case. They're simply asking for a legal document that recognizes their commitment. If there's no religious involvement, this shouldn't be a sticking point. It's akin to segregation; separate but unequal.\n\nAdditionally, concerns about adoption and community integration are misplaced. The main issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and society at large. In some areas, they face significant challenges. For example, children of gay parents in New York City have special schools because they're often bullied in regular public schools. However, this doesn't mean that parenting skills are any different in gay couples than in straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should play a role in this matter, ensuring that gay marriage is legal in every state. I think the current amendment should be amended to allow for gay marriage. However, President Bush's strong religious views on the subject complicate the issue. His stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research, which are predominantly moral arguments. While morality is a personal matter, it should not dictate government policy.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to false beliefs that gay people are psychologically damaged or had traumatic experiences in their childhood. However, these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people were to rely on actual research rather than popular culture and religious beliefs, their perspectives might shift.",

            "In my opinion, the church has evolved quite a bit to adapt to the twenty-first century and it's not as strict as it once was. Growing up, I remember going to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses with matching shoes and a purse, and seeing all my friends there on weekends. Now, the church has changed. They've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes and people dress more casually, especially during the summer when some come straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now, making the atmosphere a lot more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been completely prevented merely by allowing female priests or priests to marry. The problem isn't so much about the church's rules but the individual. Even married men can be attracted to children, and I think this is something rooted in their genetics. I believe that pedophilia is largely a genetic predisposition, not something that can be influenced by societal changes. If priests were allowed to marry, it might just delay the issue for a time, but it wouldn't change the underlying problem. I think the church could have done more to handle these situations transparently rather than trying to cover them up. However, not all cases were necessarily known or handled that way. As for any other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other significant insights to share.",
            "Initially, I was alright with the Iraq War scenario. However, in the wake of September 11th, the Bush administration connected the Iraq War with Osama Bin Laden and falsely accused Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction. This pretext for the war has since proven to be false, and it really rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for their actions. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. This is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has openly disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. They seemed to have come into office with a determination to go to war. One of their former officials, a Treasury Secretary, even hinted at this in a book he wrote after being ousted. It's clear the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and he also wanted to expand our energy supply. I think this war has continued long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to a civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, also seems problematic. Iraq's sovereignty could become an issue, and the interim government isn't in a strong position to maintain stability. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and radical elements continue to vie for control. There's a lot of unrest and friction in the political process.",
            "In all honesty, I find it quite challenging to have a clear stance on the War in Iraq. Let me see, it's not like I'm an expert on the matter, but I'll try to put my thoughts into words. At the moment, I feel it's almost pointless because it's not even a declared war; it's just like a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing. I mean, who did the terrorist attacks on Nine Eleven? It seems like we're still over there to try and build democracy and maybe secure some oil, but I don't feel like it's the right reason to stay.\n\nI mean, I’m not really a big fan of the War on Iraq, and with the lack of focus on the details, it’s a little difficult to form a strong opinion. But at this point, I know we're over there to try and create a democracy, which is a lengthy process, and to get some oil. However, I think it's just making everyone upset, and if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever.\n\nIf we leave, we'll have messed up everything, and they'll have to start from scratch on their own. It’s such a delicate situation. What if we leave? They'll be mad at us for screwing up their country, and they might not be able to fix it on their own. Then they'll have to deal with all the chaos, like little groups killing each other because of differing beliefs.\n\nI guess it's hard to say if we should stay or go. I want it to end because there are so many families with children in Iraq, and they're suffering. But at the same time, they have a different culture than us, and if we stay, we're just trying to mold them into a second United States, which could make things worse. It's like Al-Qaeda will just grow stronger, and their hatred towards the U.S. will increase.\n\nIt’s hard to find the right path in this situation. I think it's going to go on for many more years, and it's just an endless cycle of trying to help and making things worse. That's about it, I guess.",
            "To be honest, I’m not convinced that it’s right to legalize or even allow states to make it legal. I believe it’s more up to the churches to decide this, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce power over it would be in defiance of what’s already been said and written in stone. I also think that it would be a form of discrimination if the government were to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state has always been a key aspect of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don’t believe that any amendment related to this matter would be right, as it would likely be used to restrict people rather than the government. Furthermore, I don’t see any reason for the federal government or any government to be involved in this issue, except perhaps for personal belief reasons, which I believe is unfair. It’s not about impacting the economy or society; it’s about personal beliefs. I think it’s best left to the churches to decide, not the government.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality, one didn’t have that much to do with the other. The government made it seem that way to play on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that. The war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. What they were doing was removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nThe United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government. It’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and upholding or implementing democracy.\nAnd it’s going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because there are insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting the citizens in the country.\nSo first of all, I think we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases. But if you are going to go to war, you need to be prepared for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They weren’t planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today and many American troops are still dying.\nMany Iraqis wanted the US to come in. We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. How can we abandon them now? It’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq? Going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think it’s because of the oil issue. It’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nIn the election of 2004, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in there, how can we abandon these people? We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. So it’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\nI hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal preference and more of a biological trait than something chosen. It's not fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or government should interfere at this level. It's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like anyone else. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush claim to interpret the meaning of marriage, especially when two people can marry secretly without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to marry, it becomes a national issue. I believe it should be a private, personal matter, not a public one. I don't think it's fair to make it such a big deal.",
            "When you post something online, it's public knowledge. As an R.A., I've encountered this firsthand. Whatever you put out there is going to influence people's opinions of you, especially if it's about sensitive topics like shootings or bomb threats. The internet is visible to everyone, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their bulletin. If something serious is said, the school has to act on it, even if it seems like a joke. There's no invasion of privacy when it's brought to their attention, but if you don't want something out there, you shouldn't post it. You can't control what people think or how seriously they take your posts. Personally, I think school officials shouldn't be friends with students online or snooping through their profiles, but if a concern is raised, they have to take it seriously. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal activities, and it's not my place to police their actions online.",
            "I feel that the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal and are now at war merely to assert our status as a superpower. The original motivations may have been tainted by personal interests, notably George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the true purpose was to bring democracy, it was a just cause, but the war has become a protracted affair, with the initial goals diluted. The war has dragged on for years, and I believe it's time to end it. The country's officials should now take the lead. We've been draining our own resources, spending billions on a war that no longer aligns with our original purpose. There are pressing issues at home that need our attention, such as poverty and infrastructure improvement. The money being spent on this war could be much better allocated to domestic issues.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nWell, I'm not sure if this happened because someone went online and found something, but okay, let me ask you.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post personal information, it's generally available for anyone to see. I mean, you have to accept that when you're sharing something online.\n\nI understand that you might need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but if that's the case, you've already given them permission to see it.\n\nSo, whenever you put something on the internet, you should know that many people are going to see it. If someone saw something online that helped prevent a life being lost, that's tough because it's not like you can't have one person sitting around looking at everyone's profiles all day.\n\nIt becomes a form of discrimination if you think, \"Let's check the bad kids to make sure they're not up to anything.\" However, it all depends on the situation they stumbled upon the profile in. Maybe they were just casually browsing or looking for evidence that a student was planning something.\n\nI don't have a Myspace myself, but I do use Facebook. It bothers me knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I've seen a TV show where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and even convinced her to meet him in less than a minute. I would never do that, but I know people in my class who I don't recognize but know my screen name. It's hard because they might know my interests, what I look like, and even my daily schedule.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also want to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue because I only accept friend requests from people I know. You never know who can see what.\n\nOne of my roommates told me that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by the school. I thought that was a bit strange. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have a Myspace.\n\nIt just feels like an invasion of privacy, and I'm not sure if they have that authority. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "Well, I guess I only have two things to talk about concerning the Iraq War. I mean, it's not easy to discuss because I feel like a hypocrite joining in on the \"I was against it from the start\" crowd. But, let's face it, it's just not that significant anymore, right?\n\nI mean, almost everyone agrees that it was a bad idea. Look at the polls – 75 to 80% of the world thinks it was a mistake, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the troops over there. It's been a complete mess since the beginning, and pulling out will also be a disaster. The Middle East is just too complicated. The culture clash is huge, and previous administrations didn't seem to get that. It's like they thought they could just march in and impose democracy, but it's not that simple.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. We got stuck in quicksand over there. I don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have some ideas on why we should stay, but so far I haven't heard a good one.\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and at least a quarter want us to go now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Shouldn't we at least listen to them? And if we do leave, we'll be the good guys, you know, if something goes wrong, we can say we were going to stay but they wanted us to leave.\n\nBut, you know, we'll probably never be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But it's better than where we are now.",
            "I do indeed believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; I think it also affects individuals in specific fields and regions. For instance, many women struggle with the \"glass ceiling\" in professional environments, where even qualified candidates are passed over for promotions due to societal expectations. Similarly, men in certain industries, such as fashion, often face skepticism and lower expectations because of traditional gender roles. I believe that change is gradual, but it is happening. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being more accepted in the business world, as are men who choose to stay at home to care for their children. However, promoting these changes takes time and must be done subtly, without forcing the issue. Discrimination also exists based on socioeconomic background and education, with those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds facing additional challenges. Despite these obstacles, progress is being made, and society is slowly adopting more inclusive attitudes.",
            "It seems to me that they haven’t made it legal, but they've decriminalized it, which means that having marijuana has been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. Basically, if you get caught, you'll be cited rather than arrested and brought in for booking. This change in classification can have significant implications, especially with job interviews and other situations where a drug charge could be a major negative. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate these legal concerns, it does reduce the severity of them. On the other hand, there's an argument that it's a cost-effective change for municipalities, given that arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is expensive. This financial aspect can be particularly appealing for communities that are under financial strain. For instance, in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more liberal, decriminalizing marijuana can lead to greater financial resources for public education, social programs, and assistance for the elderly and homeless. While I understand that marijuana shouldn't be openly sold and smoked on the streets due to its taboo nature in many places, I think the financial benefits are worth considering. However, it's important to note that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects on individuals, and it's difficult to generalize about how people react to substances. Unlike alcohol, marijuana might have a more significant impact on lifestyle than just motor skills.",
            "I'd agree that yes, a lot of the things the Catholic Church does are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a positive aspect. By maintaining these traditions, they stay connected to their history and values. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable and open to change. A significant portion of Catholics believe that attending Church every week is mandatory, and they adhere strictly to the rules and practices. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to a lack of acceptance towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or belong to other religions. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage couldn't be blessed in the Catholic Church due to my dad's Episcopalian background. While the Church teaches to love others, their actions often contradict this by not accepting those who are not \"perfect\" Catholics or belong to other religions. This paradoxical approach can make it feel outdated and hypocritical. I believe that, at least in theory, allowing priests to marry might be a good idea. However, I'm not convinced that it would solve the issue of pedophilic behavior among priests. Child molestation is a separate issue from marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily deter such behavior, as it's more about the individual's personal inclinations than their marital status. I don't think priests would suddenly stop molesting children just because they're married.",
            "Oh, I'm still undecided on this issue, to be honest. It's such a divisive topic, straddling the delicate line between church and state, and how we define marriage. I mean, it's tricky to talk about without stepping on someone's toes. I don't know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as they are, without any government interference. I mean, if two people are united, it shouldn't matter what kind of union it is, right? And if all states can agree on a solution, then they should push for a federal law. But amending the constitution just to ban gay marriage? That's just absurd! The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that's not a broad enough cause to warrant it. It's just not important enough to change the constitution over. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so like many others, the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a grey area for me. While I have several gay friends, I personally don't align with that lifestyle, but I do believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be an issue at the national level; rather, it should be left up to each state to decide. States are diverse in their political leanings, with many being democratic or republican. Democratic states are likely to favor gay marriage, while republican states might not. Living in a state, you should respect its stance on the matter since you've chosen to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have equal opportunities as heterosexuals, and based on that, I think each state should make the decision to legalize it. I don't agree with President Bush imposing his views on the entire country on this matter. He shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should run itself, as he won't be around forever. If a Democratic president reverses the ban on gay marriage, it would just be a game of political ping-pong. It's best to leave it up to each state to decide, as they'll be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Let me put it this way, there's no doubt that Myspace is a public forum. If you look up the definition, you'll see that it's designed for public viewing. So, when you post something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. And if they're doing it to keep students safe, I see no problem with that. After all, isn't the safety of students a responsibility of the school system? But, if they're just going on the internet to catch students in trouble, I'd say that's an invasion of privacy. However, if they're using it to make the school safer, like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. I mean, if it saves lives, isn't that what's important? But, if they're using it just to catch students, that's a step too far. It's like when you're in college, you're already worried about what you say in emails. You don't want anything coming back to haunt you later. And once it's on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back. So, if they're using it to make the school safer, that's one thing. But if they're just using it to catch students, that's a different story. That's not an invasion of privacy if it's to keep the students safe.",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was quite supportive of the war because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was all for going over there and causing as much chaos as they did here. However, as time passed, I realized that we may have overlooked a lot of key factors and didn't thoughtfully consider the long-term implications. We seemed to have rushed into it without a proper plan, and I believe it ultimately backfired. I don't know if I'm being fair, but I was all for it initially. Now, I'm very much against it, as I feel it hasn't achieved anything significant. I think the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than us. They can't even manage their own lives, so I don't see how we can impose our will on them. I almost don't care about what happens over there now. It's like, they fight among themselves, and that's that. We definitely went over there unprepared, not knowing what to expect. War is different for them; they're more brutal, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. I think it would be best for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people demanded it, and he felt he had to act. At the time, I understood where he was coming from; they can't just do something like that and expect us to just let it slide. We had to respond, but I believe we could have handled it more strategically. We didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we got there. I don't think we really united behind a common goal, and that might have helped us more. Honestly, I don't think we're the right ones to change them. They'll always be the same. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but not enough to justify staying there. No matter how long we stay, it's just going to collapse once we leave. And we can't stay there forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying there. No, let's just leave."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church could make changes. They have been discussing the decline in their following, and I think it's due to their stance on several issues that aren't very accepting. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional. I believe that if they were to adopt a more modern perspective, they would be less concerned about losing their followers. Many people are turning away from the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues. For example, if you support abortion or believe in gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a church that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented some of the issues they've faced. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have the same. Let's face it, they are already devoted to God, so what's the harm in having a family life too?",
            "Well, let me share my thoughts on the matter. Personally, I'm not against gay marriage. I mean, it just doesn't seem like it's something that people choose to be. They're either born that way or whatever, and I don't think they should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, it doesn't make sense to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It just feels wrong to me to make that distinction.\n\nI haven't really given the topic a great deal of thought, but I would definitely say it's wrong to say that. It's not like they choose to be this way. I mean, I was born straight, and other people are born gay, and it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue. It's not like it affects the security of our country or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place to me. They don't have any right to interject in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. It's how they were born, or at least that's what I believe. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling argument against it. Some people claim that gay couples threaten the traditional family structure, but this is a misguided view. The dynamics of homosexual relationships are as varied and nuanced as those of heterosexual couples. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but they're not the same thing.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights issues at stake. For instance, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions on your behalf because they're not considered family. This is absurd if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many studies have shown that gay couples experience the same level of relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe confusion often stems from the fact that people believe gay couples are asking for religious ceremonies, but that's not the case. They're simply asking for a legal document that recognizes their commitment. If there's no religious involvement, this shouldn't be a sticking point. It's akin to segregation; separate but unequal.\n\nAdditionally, concerns about adoption and community integration are misplaced. The main issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and society at large. In some areas, they face significant challenges. For example, children of gay parents in New York City have special schools because they're often bullied in regular public schools. However, this doesn't mean that parenting skills are any different in gay couples than in straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should play a role in this matter, ensuring that gay marriage is legal in every state. I think the current amendment should be amended to allow for gay marriage. However, President Bush's strong religious views on the subject complicate the issue. His stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research, which are predominantly moral arguments. While morality is a personal matter, it should not dictate government policy.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to false beliefs that gay people are psychologically damaged or had traumatic experiences in their childhood. However, these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people were to rely on actual research rather than popular culture and religious beliefs, their perspectives might shift.",

            "In my opinion, the church has evolved quite a bit to adapt to the twenty-first century and it's not as strict as it once was. Growing up, I remember going to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses with matching shoes and a purse, and seeing all my friends there on weekends. Now, the church has changed. They've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes and people dress more casually, especially during the summer when some come straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now, making the atmosphere a lot more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been completely prevented merely by allowing female priests or priests to marry. The problem isn't so much about the church's rules but the individual. Even married men can be attracted to children, and I think this is something rooted in their genetics. I believe that pedophilia is largely a genetic predisposition, not something that can be influenced by societal changes. If priests were allowed to marry, it might just delay the issue for a time, but it wouldn't change the underlying problem. I think the church could have done more to handle these situations transparently rather than trying to cover them up. However, not all cases were necessarily known or handled that way. As for any other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other significant insights to share.",
            "Initially, I was alright with the Iraq War scenario. However, in the wake of September 11th, the Bush administration connected the Iraq War with Osama Bin Laden and falsely accused Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction. This pretext for the war has since proven to be false, and it really rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for their actions. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. This is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has openly disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. They seemed to have come into office with a determination to go to war. One of their former officials, a Treasury Secretary, even hinted at this in a book he wrote after being ousted. It's clear the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and he also wanted to expand our energy supply. I think this war has continued long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to a civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, also seems problematic. Iraq's sovereignty could become an issue, and the interim government isn't in a strong position to maintain stability. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and radical elements continue to vie for control. There's a lot of unrest and friction in the political process.",
            "In all honesty, I find it quite challenging to have a clear stance on the War in Iraq. Let me see, it's not like I'm an expert on the matter, but I'll try to put my thoughts into words. At the moment, I feel it's almost pointless because it's not even a declared war; it's just like a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing. I mean, who did the terrorist attacks on Nine Eleven? It seems like we're still over there to try and build democracy and maybe secure some oil, but I don't feel like it's the right reason to stay.\n\nI mean, I’m not really a big fan of the War on Iraq, and with the lack of focus on the details, it’s a little difficult to form a strong opinion. But at this point, I know we're over there to try and create a democracy, which is a lengthy process, and to get some oil. However, I think it's just making everyone upset, and if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever.\n\nIf we leave, we'll have messed up everything, and they'll have to start from scratch on their own. It’s such a delicate situation. What if we leave? They'll be mad at us for screwing up their country, and they might not be able to fix it on their own. Then they'll have to deal with all the chaos, like little groups killing each other because of differing beliefs.\n\nI guess it's hard to say if we should stay or go. I want it to end because there are so many families with children in Iraq, and they're suffering. But at the same time, they have a different culture than us, and if we stay, we're just trying to mold them into a second United States, which could make things worse. It's like Al-Qaeda will just grow stronger, and their hatred towards the U.S. will increase.\n\nIt’s hard to find the right path in this situation. I think it's going to go on for many more years, and it's just an endless cycle of trying to help and making things worse. That's about it, I guess.",
            "To be honest, I’m not convinced that it’s right to legalize or even allow states to make it legal. I believe it’s more up to the churches to decide this, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce power over it would be in defiance of what’s already been said and written in stone. I also think that it would be a form of discrimination if the government were to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state has always been a key aspect of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don’t believe that any amendment related to this matter would be right, as it would likely be used to restrict people rather than the government. Furthermore, I don’t see any reason for the federal government or any government to be involved in this issue, except perhaps for personal belief reasons, which I believe is unfair. It’s not about impacting the economy or society; it’s about personal beliefs. I think it’s best left to the churches to decide, not the government.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality, one didn’t have that much to do with the other. The government made it seem that way to play on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that. The war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. What they were doing was removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nThe United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government. It’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and upholding or implementing democracy.\nAnd it’s going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because there are insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting the citizens in the country.\nSo first of all, I think we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases. But if you are going to go to war, you need to be prepared for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They weren’t planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today and many American troops are still dying.\nMany Iraqis wanted the US to come in. We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. How can we abandon them now? It’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq? Going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think it’s because of the oil issue. It’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nIn the election of 2004, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in there, how can we abandon these people? We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. So it’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\nI hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal preference and more of a biological trait than something chosen. It's not fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or government should interfere at this level. It's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like anyone else. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush claim to interpret the meaning of marriage, especially when two people can marry secretly without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to marry, it becomes a national issue. I believe it should be a private, personal matter, not a public one. I don't think it's fair to make it such a big deal.",
            "When you post something online, it's public knowledge. As an R.A., I've encountered this firsthand. Whatever you put out there is going to influence people's opinions of you, especially if it's about sensitive topics like shootings or bomb threats. The internet is visible to everyone, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their bulletin. If something serious is said, the school has to act on it, even if it seems like a joke. There's no invasion of privacy when it's brought to their attention, but if you don't want something out there, you shouldn't post it. You can't control what people think or how seriously they take your posts. Personally, I think school officials shouldn't be friends with students online or snooping through their profiles, but if a concern is raised, they have to take it seriously. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal activities, and it's not my place to police their actions online.",
            "I feel that the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal and are now at war merely to assert our status as a superpower. The original motivations may have been tainted by personal interests, notably George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the true purpose was to bring democracy, it was a just cause, but the war has become a protracted affair, with the initial goals diluted. The war has dragged on for years, and I believe it's time to end it. The country's officials should now take the lead. We've been draining our own resources, spending billions on a war that no longer aligns with our original purpose. There are pressing issues at home that need our attention, such as poverty and infrastructure improvement. The money being spent on this war could be much better allocated to domestic issues.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nWell, I'm not sure if this happened because someone went online and found something, but okay, let me ask you.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post personal information, it's generally available for anyone to see. I mean, you have to accept that when you're sharing something online.\n\nI understand that you might need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but if that's the case, you've already given them permission to see it.\n\nSo, whenever you put something on the internet, you should know that many people are going to see it. If someone saw something online that helped prevent a life being lost, that's tough because it's not like you can't have one person sitting around looking at everyone's profiles all day.\n\nIt becomes a form of discrimination if you think, \"Let's check the bad kids to make sure they're not up to anything.\" However, it all depends on the situation they stumbled upon the profile in. Maybe they were just casually browsing or looking for evidence that a student was planning something.\n\nI don't have a Myspace myself, but I do use Facebook. It bothers me knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I've seen a TV show where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and even convinced her to meet him in less than a minute. I would never do that, but I know people in my class who I don't recognize but know my screen name. It's hard because they might know my interests, what I look like, and even my daily schedule.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also want to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue because I only accept friend requests from people I know. You never know who can see what.\n\nOne of my roommates told me that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by the school. I thought that was a bit strange. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have a Myspace.\n\nIt just feels like an invasion of privacy, and I'm not sure if they have that authority. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "Well, I guess I only have two things to talk about concerning the Iraq War. I mean, it's not easy to discuss because I feel like a hypocrite joining in on the \"I was against it from the start\" crowd. But, let's face it, it's just not that significant anymore, right?\n\nI mean, almost everyone agrees that it was a bad idea. Look at the polls – 75 to 80% of the world thinks it was a mistake, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the troops over there. It's been a complete mess since the beginning, and pulling out will also be a disaster. The Middle East is just too complicated. The culture clash is huge, and previous administrations didn't seem to get that. It's like they thought they could just march in and impose democracy, but it's not that simple.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. We got stuck in quicksand over there. I don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have some ideas on why we should stay, but so far I haven't heard a good one.\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and at least a quarter want us to go now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Shouldn't we at least listen to them? And if we do leave, we'll be the good guys, you know, if something goes wrong, we can say we were going to stay but they wanted us to leave.\n\nBut, you know, we'll probably never be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But it's better than where we are now.",
            "I do indeed believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; I think it also affects individuals in specific fields and regions. For instance, many women struggle with the \"glass ceiling\" in professional environments, where even qualified candidates are passed over for promotions due to societal expectations. Similarly, men in certain industries, such as fashion, often face skepticism and lower expectations because of traditional gender roles. I believe that change is gradual, but it is happening. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being more accepted in the business world, as are men who choose to stay at home to care for their children. However, promoting these changes takes time and must be done subtly, without forcing the issue. Discrimination also exists based on socioeconomic background and education, with those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds facing additional challenges. Despite these obstacles, progress is being made, and society is slowly adopting more inclusive attitudes.",
            "It seems to me that they haven’t made it legal, but they've decriminalized it, which means that having marijuana has been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. Basically, if you get caught, you'll be cited rather than arrested and brought in for booking. This change in classification can have significant implications, especially with job interviews and other situations where a drug charge could be a major negative. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate these legal concerns, it does reduce the severity of them. On the other hand, there's an argument that it's a cost-effective change for municipalities, given that arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is expensive. This financial aspect can be particularly appealing for communities that are under financial strain. For instance, in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more liberal, decriminalizing marijuana can lead to greater financial resources for public education, social programs, and assistance for the elderly and homeless. While I understand that marijuana shouldn't be openly sold and smoked on the streets due to its taboo nature in many places, I think the financial benefits are worth considering. However, it's important to note that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects on individuals, and it's difficult to generalize about how people react to substances. Unlike alcohol, marijuana might have a more significant impact on lifestyle than just motor skills.",
            "I'd agree that yes, a lot of the things the Catholic Church does are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a positive aspect. By maintaining these traditions, they stay connected to their history and values. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable and open to change. A significant portion of Catholics believe that attending Church every week is mandatory, and they adhere strictly to the rules and practices. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to a lack of acceptance towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or belong to other religions. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage couldn't be blessed in the Catholic Church due to my dad's Episcopalian background. While the Church teaches to love others, their actions often contradict this by not accepting those who are not \"perfect\" Catholics or belong to other religions. This paradoxical approach can make it feel outdated and hypocritical. I believe that, at least in theory, allowing priests to marry might be a good idea. However, I'm not convinced that it would solve the issue of pedophilic behavior among priests. Child molestation is a separate issue from marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily deter such behavior, as it's more about the individual's personal inclinations than their marital status. I don't think priests would suddenly stop molesting children just because they're married.",
            "Oh, I'm still undecided on this issue, to be honest. It's such a divisive topic, straddling the delicate line between church and state, and how we define marriage. I mean, it's tricky to talk about without stepping on someone's toes. I don't know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as they are, without any government interference. I mean, if two people are united, it shouldn't matter what kind of union it is, right? And if all states can agree on a solution, then they should push for a federal law. But amending the constitution just to ban gay marriage? That's just absurd! The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that's not a broad enough cause to warrant it. It's just not important enough to change the constitution over. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so like many others, the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a grey area for me. While I have several gay friends, I personally don't align with that lifestyle, but I do believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be an issue at the national level; rather, it should be left up to each state to decide. States are diverse in their political leanings, with many being democratic or republican. Democratic states are likely to favor gay marriage, while republican states might not. Living in a state, you should respect its stance on the matter since you've chosen to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have equal opportunities as heterosexuals, and based on that, I think each state should make the decision to legalize it. I don't agree with President Bush imposing his views on the entire country on this matter. He shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should run itself, as he won't be around forever. If a Democratic president reverses the ban on gay marriage, it would just be a game of political ping-pong. It's best to leave it up to each state to decide, as they'll be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Let me put it this way, there's no doubt that Myspace is a public forum. If you look up the definition, you'll see that it's designed for public viewing. So, when you post something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. And if they're doing it to keep students safe, I see no problem with that. After all, isn't the safety of students a responsibility of the school system? But, if they're just going on the internet to catch students in trouble, I'd say that's an invasion of privacy. However, if they're using it to make the school safer, like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. I mean, if it saves lives, isn't that what's important? But, if they're using it just to catch students, that's a step too far. It's like when you're in college, you're already worried about what you say in emails. You don't want anything coming back to haunt you later. And once it's on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back. So, if they're using it to make the school safer, that's one thing. But if they're just using it to catch students, that's a different story. That's not an invasion of privacy if it's to keep the students safe.",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was quite supportive of the war because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was all for going over there and causing as much chaos as they did here. However, as time passed, I realized that we may have overlooked a lot of key factors and didn't thoughtfully consider the long-term implications. We seemed to have rushed into it without a proper plan, and I believe it ultimately backfired. I don't know if I'm being fair, but I was all for it initially. Now, I'm very much against it, as I feel it hasn't achieved anything significant. I think the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than us. They can't even manage their own lives, so I don't see how we can impose our will on them. I almost don't care about what happens over there now. It's like, they fight among themselves, and that's that. We definitely went over there unprepared, not knowing what to expect. War is different for them; they're more brutal, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. I think it would be best for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people demanded it, and he felt he had to act. At the time, I understood where he was coming from; they can't just do something like that and expect us to just let it slide. We had to respond, but I believe we could have handled it more strategically. We didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we got there. I don't think we really united behind a common goal, and that might have helped us more. Honestly, I don't think we're the right ones to change them. They'll always be the same. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but not enough to justify staying there. No matter how long we stay, it's just going to collapse once we leave. And we can't stay there forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying there. No, let's just leave."
