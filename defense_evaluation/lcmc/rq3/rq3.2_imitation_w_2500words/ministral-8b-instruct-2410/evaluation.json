            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could stand to change in a few areas. They've been losing some of their followers, and I think it's due to their often steadfast views on certain topics. For instance, they have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can seem outdated in the modern world. If they were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, they might not face the same threat to their following.\n\nI've heard a lot of people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. For example, if someone is pro-abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a faith that views abortion as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they may not want to be part of a church that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI'm not sure why the Catholic Church can't ordain women as priests or allow priests to marry, but I think it would be beneficial for both the Church and its followers. It could help the Church appear more modern and relatable, while also giving priests a more balanced life. However, I'm not convinced that these changes would prevent the abuse scandals that have plagued the Church. It's hard to say if married priests or women priests would have made a difference in those situations. Ultimately, I believe that even with these changes, the Church might still face the same issues.",
            "Well, to be honest with you, I'm not one to argue against gay marriage. I mean, I think that whether someone is born with a certain sexual orientation or they choose it, it's not a conscious decision. Therefore, I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It's just wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I'd certainly say it's wrong to make such a distinction. It's not as if being gay is a choice, like being straight is for some people. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay, and I don't think that's something they should be held responsible for. I don't think it's a legal or moral issue that the federal government should be involved in. It's not about their security or moral concerns, it's just about being who they are. The federal government has no right to interfere with people's lives, especially if they haven't done anything wrong. That's just how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "It's my belief that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There really isn't a compelling reason not to. People often assert that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's just not that simple. There are so many variables involved that it's impossible to compare the two situations directly. It's like comparing heads and tails; they might look different, but they're both valid sides of the same coin. Furthermore, numerous civil rights are at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits where a partner can't be listed as next of kin if they're in a same-sex relationship. This seems unfair if you're committed to someone for life. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates in relationships as heterosexual couples. They just want the same legal document that any couple can receive from the government, a marriage certificate. Church and state involvement shouldn't be an issue when it comes to legalizing marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many people also worry about adoption issues and how children in same-sex families will be treated by society. I believe these concerns are overblown. Perhaps, in some cases, children in same-sex families may face challenges, but parenting skills and community involvement aren't affected by sexual orientation. The federal government should step in and legalize gay marriage across all states. The amendment should be reversed to reflect this. However, President Bush has strong religious views that influence his stance on the subject, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments against gay marriage are based on moral grounds, which vary greatly from person to person. It's unethical to impose the morality of one group on the entire country. Many people believe that gay people are psychologically damaged due to childhood trauma or personality defects, but the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. It's important to listen to institutions that conduct research rather than popular opinion.",
            "Well, first off, I'm working in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. I mean, we all know that. Having it available for the public? No, absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? I'd say yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. That's the thing. There are so many drugs that are illegal but are beneficial, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, things like that. Those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If you deny that just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then what's the point? You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI mean, it's not similar to alcohol. If you abuse it, alcohol can lead to bad things. But marijuana, if you abuse it, it's a tough one. I'd say, not that you could integrate it. You could let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. You gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. People have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. I mean, it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine. If we get rid of that image of marijuana as a horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe that the church has adapted to suit the twenty-first century, loosening its strictness. As I grew up, I'd attend church every Sunday, dressed to the nines in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, where I'd see friends at church on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that lasts just thirty minutes, and people wear more casual attire, especially during summer when they come straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, I see folks in jeans and khakis. I think the church has become more casual overall. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics, but the biggest thing I've noticed is the change in dress code and the introduction of a shorter mass. [OK, regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, like allowing female priests or priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided because there are men who become pedophiles even if they're married. It's more about individual predisposition than rules. If they really wanted to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer?] I think it's more about genetics influencing sexuality. People are born that way, not just from upbringing. I don't think marriage can change that. If the church knew about it and covered it up, that's shameful, but I don't think they always knew. [Do you have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church?] No.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was on board with the initial premise, but I believe everyone was still deeply affected by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. There were several reasons that led us into Iraq, including claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which have since been proven false.\nI find it utterly infuriating that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility.\nEven Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence he was presenting at the time.\nTo me, that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people, and I believe they've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution since the September 11th attacks.\nIt seems they came into office with an intent to go to war, perhaps driven by a desire to expand our energy supply.\nI think the Iraq war has gone on long enough, but I'm concerned that withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to try to restore order, but I'm not convinced that's a good idea in the long term.\nIraq's sovereignty could become a major issue, as the interim government appears to be dissolving.

            "Ok, let me see. I did just talk into it. Mm-hmm. How I feel about the War in Iraq? Well, at this point, it's kind of pointless, you know? I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? And it feels like it was just like, a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing because that's who we figured did the 9/11 attacks. So, I don't know. I'm not a big fan of the War on Iraq; I don't really keep up with the details. But I think at this point, we're over there to try and build democracy so it can become another U.S. kind of place and also to get oil from them. But it's not a reason to stay over there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up. Oh, this topic is so hard. The War in Iraq? Oh, man, it's so hard. I don't know what to say. Can you give me something else to go off of? Ok, thank you. Well, um, actually, I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is to show that we're big and American. But I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore because it never was declared by Congress. You have to declare a war by Congress, you know? I just don't think it's a real big point to stay over there and try. No, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also wasting our resources. And right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like he's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. because of what it's doing. Because remember, the Vietnam War was like undeclared, and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called that president forever because he started this meaningless war. Huh, you have to make this a half an hour, don't you? Uh, yeah. Well, I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there are so many families whose sons and daughters are in Iraq, and I want it to keep going because of that. But then again, it's hard to say we want them there because their culture is so different from ours. And if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into another United States, and it's going to be even worse for them. And it's going to make the Al-Qaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on the whole totalitarian thing for so long. That it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So, I think this whole thing is going to continue for years and years and years. Hmm, that's about it. Ok.",
            "I genuinely believe that it's not right to legalize it or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states our separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any rules or power over it would go against the principles already established in our constitution. I think those pushing for it are pitting one church's beliefs against others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in certain areas like Boston. It's not up to the government to decide what churches should or shouldn't make illegal. Our constitution already provides for religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been established. Plus, it's one of the few amendments that could be used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The person pushing for this amendment is doing so because it goes against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I truly believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no valid reason for an amendment banning it, as I don't see how it would impact the economy or society negatively. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nLet me start from the beginning. I don’t believe the government was completely honest with the American people about the war in Iraq. I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though there wasn't a strong connection. They played on the emotions of the American people, and the invasion started in 2003.\n\nI myself am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic one, a process that should have been carefully planned.\n\nI think the government didn't prepare well for the challenges that would follow, and they didn't account for the massive insurgency that would arise. They should have learned from the Vietnam War, where the US faced a similar challenge. The US government made it seem like victory would be swift and easy, which was naive and deceiving.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to finish what he started, but it's difficult to see how we can abandon Iraq now. We can't leave them without their government anymore. It's a tough decision because we’ve been there for so long and there are so many American casualties. But how much is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnother consideration is why we're not doing this in other countries. It seems to be about oil, and we get oil from Iraq. The government's justification for the war was about weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, North Korea has them, and we aren't making any attacks against them. I don't think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and brings peace, but I doubt it.",
            "Let's dive right in. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it should be a personal preference, not something that society or the government should interfere with. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they have no control over, especially when science shows it might be biological rather than sociological. In my neighborhood, I have a few openly gay couples who live together, and they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs on the street, and it's clear they're happy and loving. But the government, particularly with Bush trying to interpret marriage his way, is being ridiculous. It's like they're trying to play God. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that needs to be in the public's eye or dictated by the government. It's strange that a guy and a girl can get married in secret in Las Vegas, but if two gay people want to do the same, it makes the news. That's not fair.",

Obviously, the school isn't looking at these things, but someone in the community might notice and bring it to the school's attention.\n\nThere's no invasion of privacy when something is brought to the school's attention. If you don't want something to be seen, don't put it online. You can't tell people what to think or take seriously. The school officials aren't supposed to be monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IM's, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nFor example, a few months ago, someone overheard something in the school and got worried. They went through the person's Facebook and found something that was meant as a joke but became serious in light of the situation. If something is brought to the school's attention, there's no invasion of privacy, because the information was made public.\n\nTeachers shouldn't be creating accounts under different names and becoming friends with their students. I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook for the same reason. I don't want to see what they're doing or posting, like going out and drinking. If it's brought to their attention, though, the school has to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out far too long. I think the original intent was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we've strayed from that purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove our status as a superpower. The initial motivations were questionable, involving previous tensions between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to democratize a country with an unfair political system, that would be a valid reason for the war. However, I think our original objectives have become distorted, and we're now stuck in a conflict with an unclear endgame. We're still at war, not because we must, but because we don't want to retreat without a decisive victory. It's been drawn out for too long. The government there now needs to stand on its own, and we should focus on our own economic struggles. We're spending billions that could be better used on our own issues, like poverty and public infrastructure. The war is a long-term drain on our economy, and there are pressing domestic issues that need our attention. It's time to bring our troops home.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems like something was prevented because someone went online and found something, right? Like, maybe it was something on a site like Myspace? Well, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see, right? I understand that on Myspace, you usually have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, they have permission to see it. So, whenever you put information online, you have to understand that a lot of people might see it. In this case, I think it was actually good that someone found the information and prevented a life from being lost. It's a tough situation, though. How can you have one person looking at everyone's profiles all day to prevent that? That could lead to discrimination if they focus on the \"bad kids.\" I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at profiles. But maybe it depends on what they found and why. Were they looking for evidence of something? I don't know. I don't have a Myspace, but I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and talk to her within minutes. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who knew my screen name and sent me messages. They know my interests, what I look like, and even where I am during the day. It's hard because you think they know all about you. I try to limit what I put up there, but I want to communicate with my friends, so it's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might look at what.\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard my roommate mentioning that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and it struck me as a bit strange. How could school officials tell their students they weren't allowed to have it? I don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I'm not sure they had the right to tell people they couldn't have it. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have a couple more points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing this up\nI hate to admit it\nBut I was against the war from the start\nUm\nBut it's not as important now\nBecause the general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration\nAnd they don't want to admit they were wrong\nUm\nYou just have to look at the polls\nThey've done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls\nAnd about 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\n80 percent of Iraqis\nUm\n70 percent of the troops over there think it was a dumb idea, and they want us to pull out within the year\nUm\nI don't know\nIt's just been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a disaster before we even went in\nAnd now pulling out is going to be a disaster too\nThere's no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI think it's just the culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states\nThe gap is too big for the administration, or previous ones, to understand\nAnd they think they can just bring Democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist\nUm\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will just turn into a disaster\nLike quicksand\nUm\nI don't even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don't see a reason to stay\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas as to why we should stay\nBut I haven't heard a legitimate reason\nUm\nIf they want to do it gradually over a year or a bit longer\nI wouldn't really have a problem with that\nBut I just don't see a reason to stay any longer than that\nUm\nI mean, I read that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them think we should leave now\nUm\nThese are the people we're trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nYou know, I think they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out after that, we'll be the good guys\nWell, not really, no\nBut at least we won't be in the situation we're in now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I certainly believe that gender discrimination remains a significant issue in the United States. It’s not just about women; it extends to various fields of work. For instance, women often struggle to ascend to positions that they qualify for, as society is conditioned to view men as better suited for leadership roles in the business world. Similarly, men face challenges when they step into roles like stay-at-home dads or work in the fashion industry, where their expertise is often questioned. This isn’t confined to gender but extends to other factors like socioeconomic background. While we’ve made progress, change is slow. We can continue to promote acceptance by highlighting the positive attributes of those who defy societal norms without being too forceful. I believe we’re at a good balance where these changes are starting to be accepted. It’s a slow process, but we’re making progress. Discrimination isn’t just about gender; it also involves factors like where you come from and your background.",
            "Understood, they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. It's like going from a criminal offense to getting a traffic ticket. Catching someone with a drug charge could lead to job interview ramifications, but the worst ones usually don't disappear when it's decriminalized. There's an argument that arresting and processing people is expensive. It costs a lot to book, house, and process them, and even more to go through court and appoint a public defender. Municipalities might not make these concessions, even if it could free up money for other programs. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal, it's okay. They have more money now for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Marijuana isn't something you want to be everywhere, but there's a financial element to it. If it were totally legal, it could be sold in gas stations, leading to more people smoking and driving under its influence—something that's still taboo in many places. I think marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyle than just motor skills. Everyone reacts differently, and some people exercise moderation while others don't. Both substances have their adverse effects, and it's hard to generalize due to differing reactions.",
            "I would say yes, for sure. A lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing them for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week and they're quite strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So it might be a different realm, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, I guess people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's about children, which is different than a spouse. If you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "Well, I'm still on the fence about this whole debate on marriage. I haven't formed a solid opinion yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. But I must admit, this is one of the trickiest topics we're facing today, especially when it comes to the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. It's so sensitive that it's hard to discuss without offending someone.\n\nI think all civil unions should be looked at the same way by the government, just like a civil union. If you're married, I believe they should just treat it as a civil union, because that's essentially what it is - two people united. They shouldn't differentiate it based on the type of ceremony or belief system involved.\n\nAnd as for gay marriage, it's just another form of a civil union, really. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion about this, then it makes sense to push for federal recognition. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit nuanced for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not fully agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized and that it shouldn't be a national issue. I think the decision should be left to each state rather than the president dictating it for the entire country.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican, and it's clear which side of the issue they lean towards. If you live in a democratic state, you're well aware of its stance on gay marriage. So, if a state decides to legalize it, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and as such, I think gay marriage should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI don't feel as though former President Bush should have decided that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think he should have the power to dictate how each state runs itself, as he doesn't live in every single state. Plus, he's leaving office soon, and if a democratic president decides to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. I believe that some things should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will be most affected by their decision.",
            "Um, no, I don't think so.\nUm, let me see, I guess the thing is...\nMyspace is a public space, you know?\nLike, if you look at the definition of a bulletin board, it's basically for public display.\nUm, so if you post something on the internet, you have to understand that people, especially school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not.\nUm, and even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could still access it through their own homes, you know?\nBut, with something like trying to prevent a school shooting, well, as long as it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I think that's perfectly fine.\nI mean, if they're just going on there to catch students for doing something they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, then I feel like that's an invasion of privacy.\nBut if they're doing it to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all.\nUm, I mean, it's a public space, so you have to expect that people will see what you post.\nUm, like, if you're posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of ridiculous.\nUm, I mean, everything you post on the internet can come back to haunt you, you know?\nUm, like, if you're a college student and you post something that you don't want to be seen by the public later on, that can come back to bite you in the butt, you know?\nUm, like, once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\nUm, so you have to be careful about what you put out there.\nUm, like, I've had discussions with teachers about this, especially when I was in high school.\nUm, they said they have to make sure stuff like this is safe, you know?\nLike, they have to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the terrorist attacks.\nUm, and even though that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's still important to be safe about it.\nUm, so, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, you know?\nUm, like, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that.\nUm, so, that's basically what I was trying to say, you know?",
            "In the beginning, the war seemed like a good idea to me, especially considering the personal impact of nine eleven. I was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they did for us. However, I think we overlooked many things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared and without a clear plan, and I believe it backfired on us. Now, I'm very much against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. The people over there, they're fighting with each other, and I don't think us being there will stop that. They're just looking to get us out of there, and I think that should be fine. We just need to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. We didn't consider what this could lead to or how they would react to our presence. The president, at the time, was driven by public sentiment and his own desire to act. I understand that, but I think we could have had a better plan. We really didn't know what we were supposed to do to create order. There was no unity or clear purpose. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always going to be like that. We're not making enough progress, and I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it will collapse. We can't stay there forever. I don't think we're doing ourselves any good by staying there."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could stand to change in a few areas. They've been losing some of their followers, and I think it's due to their often steadfast views on certain topics. For instance, they have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can seem outdated in the modern world. If they were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, they might not face the same threat to their following.\n\nI've heard a lot of people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. For example, if someone is pro-abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a faith that views abortion as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they may not want to be part of a church that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI'm not sure why the Catholic Church can't ordain women as priests or allow priests to marry, but I think it would be beneficial for both the Church and its followers. It could help the Church appear more modern and relatable, while also giving priests a more balanced life. However, I'm not convinced that these changes would prevent the abuse scandals that have plagued the Church. It's hard to say if married priests or women priests would have made a difference in those situations. Ultimately, I believe that even with these changes, the Church might still face the same issues.",
            "Well, to be honest with you, I'm not one to argue against gay marriage. I mean, I think that whether someone is born with a certain sexual orientation or they choose it, it's not a conscious decision. Therefore, I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It's just wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I'd certainly say it's wrong to make such a distinction. It's not as if being gay is a choice, like being straight is for some people. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay, and I don't think that's something they should be held responsible for. I don't think it's a legal or moral issue that the federal government should be involved in. It's not about their security or moral concerns, it's just about being who they are. The federal government has no right to interfere with people's lives, especially if they haven't done anything wrong. That's just how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "It's my belief that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There really isn't a compelling reason not to. People often assert that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's just not that simple. There are so many variables involved that it's impossible to compare the two situations directly. It's like comparing heads and tails; they might look different, but they're both valid sides of the same coin. Furthermore, numerous civil rights are at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits where a partner can't be listed as next of kin if they're in a same-sex relationship. This seems unfair if you're committed to someone for life. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates in relationships as heterosexual couples. They just want the same legal document that any couple can receive from the government, a marriage certificate. Church and state involvement shouldn't be an issue when it comes to legalizing marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many people also worry about adoption issues and how children in same-sex families will be treated by society. I believe these concerns are overblown. Perhaps, in some cases, children in same-sex families may face challenges, but parenting skills and community involvement aren't affected by sexual orientation. The federal government should step in and legalize gay marriage across all states. The amendment should be reversed to reflect this. However, President Bush has strong religious views that influence his stance on the subject, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments against gay marriage are based on moral grounds, which vary greatly from person to person. It's unethical to impose the morality of one group on the entire country. Many people believe that gay people are psychologically damaged due to childhood trauma or personality defects, but the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. It's important to listen to institutions that conduct research rather than popular opinion.",
            "Well, first off, I'm working in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. I mean, we all know that. Having it available for the public? No, absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? I'd say yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. That's the thing. There are so many drugs that are illegal but are beneficial, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, things like that. Those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If you deny that just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then what's the point? You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI mean, it's not similar to alcohol. If you abuse it, alcohol can lead to bad things. But marijuana, if you abuse it, it's a tough one. I'd say, not that you could integrate it. You could let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. You gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. People have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. I mean, it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine. If we get rid of that image of marijuana as a horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe that the church has adapted to suit the twenty-first century, loosening its strictness. As I grew up, I'd attend church every Sunday, dressed to the nines in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, where I'd see friends at church on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that lasts just thirty minutes, and people wear more casual attire, especially during summer when they come straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, I see folks in jeans and khakis. I think the church has become more casual overall. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics, but the biggest thing I've noticed is the change in dress code and the introduction of a shorter mass. [OK, regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, like allowing female priests or priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided because there are men who become pedophiles even if they're married. It's more about individual predisposition than rules. If they really wanted to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer?] I think it's more about genetics influencing sexuality. People are born that way, not just from upbringing. I don't think marriage can change that. If the church knew about it and covered it up, that's shameful, but I don't think they always knew. [Do you have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church?] No.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was on board with the initial premise, but I believe everyone was still deeply affected by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. There were several reasons that led us into Iraq, including claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which have since been proven false.\nI find it utterly infuriating that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility.\nEven Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence he was presenting at the time.\nTo me, that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people, and I believe they've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution since the September 11th attacks.\nIt seems they came into office with an intent to go to war, perhaps driven by a desire to expand our energy supply.\nI think the Iraq war has gone on long enough, but I'm concerned that withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to try to restore order, but I'm not convinced that's a good idea in the long term.\nIraq's sovereignty could become a major issue, as the interim government appears to be dissolving.

            "Ok, let me see. I did just talk into it. Mm-hmm. How I feel about the War in Iraq? Well, at this point, it's kind of pointless, you know? I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? And it feels like it was just like, a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing because that's who we figured did the 9/11 attacks. So, I don't know. I'm not a big fan of the War on Iraq; I don't really keep up with the details. But I think at this point, we're over there to try and build democracy so it can become another U.S. kind of place and also to get oil from them. But it's not a reason to stay over there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up. Oh, this topic is so hard. The War in Iraq? Oh, man, it's so hard. I don't know what to say. Can you give me something else to go off of? Ok, thank you. Well, um, actually, I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is to show that we're big and American. But I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore because it never was declared by Congress. You have to declare a war by Congress, you know? I just don't think it's a real big point to stay over there and try. No, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also wasting our resources. And right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like he's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. because of what it's doing. Because remember, the Vietnam War was like undeclared, and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called that president forever because he started this meaningless war. Huh, you have to make this a half an hour, don't you? Uh, yeah. Well, I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there are so many families whose sons and daughters are in Iraq, and I want it to keep going because of that. But then again, it's hard to say we want them there because their culture is so different from ours. And if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into another United States, and it's going to be even worse for them. And it's going to make the Al-Qaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on the whole totalitarian thing for so long. That it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So, I think this whole thing is going to continue for years and years and years. Hmm, that's about it. Ok.",
            "I genuinely believe that it's not right to legalize it or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states our separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any rules or power over it would go against the principles already established in our constitution. I think those pushing for it are pitting one church's beliefs against others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in certain areas like Boston. It's not up to the government to decide what churches should or shouldn't make illegal. Our constitution already provides for religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been established. Plus, it's one of the few amendments that could be used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The person pushing for this amendment is doing so because it goes against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I truly believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no valid reason for an amendment banning it, as I don't see how it would impact the economy or society negatively. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nLet me start from the beginning. I don’t believe the government was completely honest with the American people about the war in Iraq. I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though there wasn't a strong connection. They played on the emotions of the American people, and the invasion started in 2003.\n\nI myself am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic one, a process that should have been carefully planned.\n\nI think the government didn't prepare well for the challenges that would follow, and they didn't account for the massive insurgency that would arise. They should have learned from the Vietnam War, where the US faced a similar challenge. The US government made it seem like victory would be swift and easy, which was naive and deceiving.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to finish what he started, but it's difficult to see how we can abandon Iraq now. We can't leave them without their government anymore. It's a tough decision because we’ve been there for so long and there are so many American casualties. But how much is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnother consideration is why we're not doing this in other countries. It seems to be about oil, and we get oil from Iraq. The government's justification for the war was about weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, North Korea has them, and we aren't making any attacks against them. I don't think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and brings peace, but I doubt it.",
            "Let's dive right in. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it should be a personal preference, not something that society or the government should interfere with. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they have no control over, especially when science shows it might be biological rather than sociological. In my neighborhood, I have a few openly gay couples who live together, and they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs on the street, and it's clear they're happy and loving. But the government, particularly with Bush trying to interpret marriage his way, is being ridiculous. It's like they're trying to play God. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that needs to be in the public's eye or dictated by the government. It's strange that a guy and a girl can get married in secret in Las Vegas, but if two gay people want to do the same, it makes the news. That's not fair.",

Obviously, the school isn't looking at these things, but someone in the community might notice and bring it to the school's attention.\n\nThere's no invasion of privacy when something is brought to the school's attention. If you don't want something to be seen, don't put it online. You can't tell people what to think or take seriously. The school officials aren't supposed to be monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IM's, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nFor example, a few months ago, someone overheard something in the school and got worried. They went through the person's Facebook and found something that was meant as a joke but became serious in light of the situation. If something is brought to the school's attention, there's no invasion of privacy, because the information was made public.\n\nTeachers shouldn't be creating accounts under different names and becoming friends with their students. I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook for the same reason. I don't want to see what they're doing or posting, like going out and drinking. If it's brought to their attention, though, the school has to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out far too long. I think the original intent was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we've strayed from that purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove our status as a superpower. The initial motivations were questionable, involving previous tensions between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to democratize a country with an unfair political system, that would be a valid reason for the war. However, I think our original objectives have become distorted, and we're now stuck in a conflict with an unclear endgame. We're still at war, not because we must, but because we don't want to retreat without a decisive victory. It's been drawn out for too long. The government there now needs to stand on its own, and we should focus on our own economic struggles. We're spending billions that could be better used on our own issues, like poverty and public infrastructure. The war is a long-term drain on our economy, and there are pressing domestic issues that need our attention. It's time to bring our troops home.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems like something was prevented because someone went online and found something, right? Like, maybe it was something on a site like Myspace? Well, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see, right? I understand that on Myspace, you usually have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, they have permission to see it. So, whenever you put information online, you have to understand that a lot of people might see it. In this case, I think it was actually good that someone found the information and prevented a life from being lost. It's a tough situation, though. How can you have one person looking at everyone's profiles all day to prevent that? That could lead to discrimination if they focus on the \"bad kids.\" I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at profiles. But maybe it depends on what they found and why. Were they looking for evidence of something? I don't know. I don't have a Myspace, but I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and talk to her within minutes. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who knew my screen name and sent me messages. They know my interests, what I look like, and even where I am during the day. It's hard because you think they know all about you. I try to limit what I put up there, but I want to communicate with my friends, so it's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might look at what.\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard my roommate mentioning that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and it struck me as a bit strange. How could school officials tell their students they weren't allowed to have it? I don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I'm not sure they had the right to tell people they couldn't have it. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have a couple more points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing this up\nI hate to admit it\nBut I was against the war from the start\nUm\nBut it's not as important now\nBecause the general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration\nAnd they don't want to admit they were wrong\nUm\nYou just have to look at the polls\nThey've done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls\nAnd about 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\n80 percent of Iraqis\nUm\n70 percent of the troops over there think it was a dumb idea, and they want us to pull out within the year\nUm\nI don't know\nIt's just been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a disaster before we even went in\nAnd now pulling out is going to be a disaster too\nThere's no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI think it's just the culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states\nThe gap is too big for the administration, or previous ones, to understand\nAnd they think they can just bring Democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist\nUm\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will just turn into a disaster\nLike quicksand\nUm\nI don't even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don't see a reason to stay\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas as to why we should stay\nBut I haven't heard a legitimate reason\nUm\nIf they want to do it gradually over a year or a bit longer\nI wouldn't really have a problem with that\nBut I just don't see a reason to stay any longer than that\nUm\nI mean, I read that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them think we should leave now\nUm\nThese are the people we're trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nYou know, I think they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out after that, we'll be the good guys\nWell, not really, no\nBut at least we won't be in the situation we're in now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I certainly believe that gender discrimination remains a significant issue in the United States. It’s not just about women; it extends to various fields of work. For instance, women often struggle to ascend to positions that they qualify for, as society is conditioned to view men as better suited for leadership roles in the business world. Similarly, men face challenges when they step into roles like stay-at-home dads or work in the fashion industry, where their expertise is often questioned. This isn’t confined to gender but extends to other factors like socioeconomic background. While we’ve made progress, change is slow. We can continue to promote acceptance by highlighting the positive attributes of those who defy societal norms without being too forceful. I believe we’re at a good balance where these changes are starting to be accepted. It’s a slow process, but we’re making progress. Discrimination isn’t just about gender; it also involves factors like where you come from and your background.",
            "Understood, they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. It's like going from a criminal offense to getting a traffic ticket. Catching someone with a drug charge could lead to job interview ramifications, but the worst ones usually don't disappear when it's decriminalized. There's an argument that arresting and processing people is expensive. It costs a lot to book, house, and process them, and even more to go through court and appoint a public defender. Municipalities might not make these concessions, even if it could free up money for other programs. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal, it's okay. They have more money now for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Marijuana isn't something you want to be everywhere, but there's a financial element to it. If it were totally legal, it could be sold in gas stations, leading to more people smoking and driving under its influence—something that's still taboo in many places. I think marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyle than just motor skills. Everyone reacts differently, and some people exercise moderation while others don't. Both substances have their adverse effects, and it's hard to generalize due to differing reactions.",
            "I would say yes, for sure. A lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing them for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week and they're quite strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So it might be a different realm, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, I guess people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's about children, which is different than a spouse. If you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "Well, I'm still on the fence about this whole debate on marriage. I haven't formed a solid opinion yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. But I must admit, this is one of the trickiest topics we're facing today, especially when it comes to the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. It's so sensitive that it's hard to discuss without offending someone.\n\nI think all civil unions should be looked at the same way by the government, just like a civil union. If you're married, I believe they should just treat it as a civil union, because that's essentially what it is - two people united. They shouldn't differentiate it based on the type of ceremony or belief system involved.\n\nAnd as for gay marriage, it's just another form of a civil union, really. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion about this, then it makes sense to push for federal recognition. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit nuanced for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not fully agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized and that it shouldn't be a national issue. I think the decision should be left to each state rather than the president dictating it for the entire country.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican, and it's clear which side of the issue they lean towards. If you live in a democratic state, you're well aware of its stance on gay marriage. So, if a state decides to legalize it, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and as such, I think gay marriage should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI don't feel as though former President Bush should have decided that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think he should have the power to dictate how each state runs itself, as he doesn't live in every single state. Plus, he's leaving office soon, and if a democratic president decides to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. I believe that some things should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will be most affected by their decision.",
            "Um, no, I don't think so.\nUm, let me see, I guess the thing is...\nMyspace is a public space, you know?\nLike, if you look at the definition of a bulletin board, it's basically for public display.\nUm, so if you post something on the internet, you have to understand that people, especially school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not.\nUm, and even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could still access it through their own homes, you know?\nBut, with something like trying to prevent a school shooting, well, as long as it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I think that's perfectly fine.\nI mean, if they're just going on there to catch students for doing something they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, then I feel like that's an invasion of privacy.\nBut if they're doing it to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all.\nUm, I mean, it's a public space, so you have to expect that people will see what you post.\nUm, like, if you're posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of ridiculous.\nUm, I mean, everything you post on the internet can come back to haunt you, you know?\nUm, like, if you're a college student and you post something that you don't want to be seen by the public later on, that can come back to bite you in the butt, you know?\nUm, like, once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\nUm, so you have to be careful about what you put out there.\nUm, like, I've had discussions with teachers about this, especially when I was in high school.\nUm, they said they have to make sure stuff like this is safe, you know?\nLike, they have to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the terrorist attacks.\nUm, and even though that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's still important to be safe about it.\nUm, so, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, you know?\nUm, like, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that.\nUm, so, that's basically what I was trying to say, you know?",
            "In the beginning, the war seemed like a good idea to me, especially considering the personal impact of nine eleven. I was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they did for us. However, I think we overlooked many things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared and without a clear plan, and I believe it backfired on us. Now, I'm very much against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. The people over there, they're fighting with each other, and I don't think us being there will stop that. They're just looking to get us out of there, and I think that should be fine. We just need to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. We didn't consider what this could lead to or how they would react to our presence. The president, at the time, was driven by public sentiment and his own desire to act. I understand that, but I think we could have had a better plan. We really didn't know what we were supposed to do to create order. There was no unity or clear purpose. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always going to be like that. We're not making enough progress, and I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it will collapse. We can't stay there forever. I don't think we're doing ourselves any good by staying there."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could stand to change in a few areas. They've been losing some of their followers, and I think it's due to their often steadfast views on certain topics. For instance, they have strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can seem outdated in the modern world. If they were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, they might not face the same threat to their following.\n\nI've heard a lot of people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because they disagree with their stance on these issues. For example, if someone is pro-abortion, they might not feel comfortable in a faith that views abortion as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they may not want to be part of a church that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI'm not sure why the Catholic Church can't ordain women as priests or allow priests to marry, but I think it would be beneficial for both the Church and its followers. It could help the Church appear more modern and relatable, while also giving priests a more balanced life. However, I'm not convinced that these changes would prevent the abuse scandals that have plagued the Church. It's hard to say if married priests or women priests would have made a difference in those situations. Ultimately, I believe that even with these changes, the Church might still face the same issues.",
            "Well, to be honest with you, I'm not one to argue against gay marriage. I mean, I think that whether someone is born with a certain sexual orientation or they choose it, it's not a conscious decision. Therefore, I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It's just wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I'd certainly say it's wrong to make such a distinction. It's not as if being gay is a choice, like being straight is for some people. I mean, I was born straight, and others are born gay, and I don't think that's something they should be held responsible for. I don't think it's a legal or moral issue that the federal government should be involved in. It's not about their security or moral concerns, it's just about being who they are. The federal government has no right to interfere with people's lives, especially if they haven't done anything wrong. That's just how they were born, and they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "It's my belief that gay marriage ought to be legalized. There really isn't a compelling reason not to. People often assert that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's just not that simple. There are so many variables involved that it's impossible to compare the two situations directly. It's like comparing heads and tails; they might look different, but they're both valid sides of the same coin. Furthermore, numerous civil rights are at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits where a partner can't be listed as next of kin if they're in a same-sex relationship. This seems unfair if you're committed to someone for life. Scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar success rates in relationships as heterosexual couples. They just want the same legal document that any couple can receive from the government, a marriage certificate. Church and state involvement shouldn't be an issue when it comes to legalizing marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Many people also worry about adoption issues and how children in same-sex families will be treated by society. I believe these concerns are overblown. Perhaps, in some cases, children in same-sex families may face challenges, but parenting skills and community involvement aren't affected by sexual orientation. The federal government should step in and legalize gay marriage across all states. The amendment should be reversed to reflect this. However, President Bush has strong religious views that influence his stance on the subject, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments against gay marriage are based on moral grounds, which vary greatly from person to person. It's unethical to impose the morality of one group on the entire country. Many people believe that gay people are psychologically damaged due to childhood trauma or personality defects, but the American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. It's important to listen to institutions that conduct research rather than popular opinion.",
            "Well, first off, I'm working in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. I mean, we all know that. Having it available for the public? No, absolutely not. But for medicinal purposes? I'd say yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. That's the thing. There are so many drugs that are illegal but are beneficial, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, things like that. Those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If you deny that just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then what's the point? You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI mean, it's not similar to alcohol. If you abuse it, alcohol can lead to bad things. But marijuana, if you abuse it, it's a tough one. I'd say, not that you could integrate it. You could let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. You gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. People have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. I mean, it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroine or cocaine. If we get rid of that image of marijuana as a horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe that the church has adapted to suit the twenty-first century, loosening its strictness. As I grew up, I'd attend church every Sunday, dressed to the nines in cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, where I'd see friends at church on weekends. Now, though, they've introduced a teenager mass that lasts just thirty minutes, and people wear more casual attire, especially during summer when they come straight from the beach. Even at morning masses, I see folks in jeans and khakis. I think the church has become more casual overall. As for other changes, I don't know much about the church's politics, but the biggest thing I've noticed is the change in dress code and the introduction of a shorter mass. [OK, regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, like allowing female priests or priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided because there are men who become pedophiles even if they're married. It's more about individual predisposition than rules. If they really wanted to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer?] I think it's more about genetics influencing sexuality. People are born that way, not just from upbringing. I don't think marriage can change that. If the church knew about it and covered it up, that's shameful, but I don't think they always knew. [Do you have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church?] No.",
            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was on board with the initial premise, but I believe everyone was still deeply affected by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. There were several reasons that led us into Iraq, including claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which have since been proven false.\nI find it utterly infuriating that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility.\nEven Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence he was presenting at the time.\nTo me, that's an impeachable offense. They lied to the American people, and I believe they've shown a complete disregard for the Constitution since the September 11th attacks.\nIt seems they came into office with an intent to go to war, perhaps driven by a desire to expand our energy supply.\nI think the Iraq war has gone on long enough, but I'm concerned that withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more deaths.\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to try to restore order, but I'm not convinced that's a good idea in the long term.\nIraq's sovereignty could become a major issue, as the interim government appears to be dissolving.

            "Ok, let me see. I did just talk into it. Mm-hmm. How I feel about the War in Iraq? Well, at this point, it's kind of pointless, you know? I mean, it's not even a declared war, right? And it feels like it was just like, a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing because that's who we figured did the 9/11 attacks. So, I don't know. I'm not a big fan of the War on Iraq; I don't really keep up with the details. But I think at this point, we're over there to try and build democracy so it can become another U.S. kind of place and also to get oil from them. But it's not a reason to stay over there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up. Oh, this topic is so hard. The War in Iraq? Oh, man, it's so hard. I don't know what to say. Can you give me something else to go off of? Ok, thank you. Well, um, actually, I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is to show that we're big and American. But I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore because it never was declared by Congress. You have to declare a war by Congress, you know? I just don't think it's a real big point to stay over there and try. No, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also wasting our resources. And right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like he's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. because of what it's doing. Because remember, the Vietnam War was like undeclared, and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called that president forever because he started this meaningless war. Huh, you have to make this a half an hour, don't you? Uh, yeah. Well, I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there are so many families whose sons and daughters are in Iraq, and I want it to keep going because of that. But then again, it's hard to say we want them there because their culture is so different from ours. And if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into another United States, and it's going to be even worse for them. And it's going to make the Al-Qaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on the whole totalitarian thing for so long. That it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So, I think this whole thing is going to continue for years and years and years. Hmm, that's about it. Ok.",
            "I genuinely believe that it's not right to legalize it or for a state to declare it legal. It should be up to the churches, as the Constitution clearly states our separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any rules or power over it would go against the principles already established in our constitution. I think those pushing for it are pitting one church's beliefs against others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for in certain areas like Boston. It's not up to the government to decide what churches should or shouldn't make illegal. Our constitution already provides for religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been established. Plus, it's one of the few amendments that could be used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The person pushing for this amendment is doing so because it goes against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for an amendment is showing a preference for one religion over others. I truly believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no valid reason for an amendment banning it, as I don't see how it would impact the economy or society negatively. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nLet me start from the beginning. I don’t believe the government was completely honest with the American people about the war in Iraq. I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though there wasn't a strong connection. They played on the emotions of the American people, and the invasion started in 2003.\n\nI myself am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and the government wasn't prepared for the aftermath. They removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic one, a process that should have been carefully planned.\n\nI think the government didn't prepare well for the challenges that would follow, and they didn't account for the massive insurgency that would arise. They should have learned from the Vietnam War, where the US faced a similar challenge. The US government made it seem like victory would be swift and easy, which was naive and deceiving.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to finish what he started, but it's difficult to see how we can abandon Iraq now. We can't leave them without their government anymore. It's a tough decision because we’ve been there for so long and there are so many American casualties. But how much is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nAnother consideration is why we're not doing this in other countries. It seems to be about oil, and we get oil from Iraq. The government's justification for the war was about weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, North Korea has them, and we aren't making any attacks against them. I don't think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and brings peace, but I doubt it.",
            "Let's dive right in. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it should be a personal preference, not something that society or the government should interfere with. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they have no control over, especially when science shows it might be biological rather than sociological. In my neighborhood, I have a few openly gay couples who live together, and they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs on the street, and it's clear they're happy and loving. But the government, particularly with Bush trying to interpret marriage his way, is being ridiculous. It's like they're trying to play God. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that needs to be in the public's eye or dictated by the government. It's strange that a guy and a girl can get married in secret in Las Vegas, but if two gay people want to do the same, it makes the news. That's not fair.",

Obviously, the school isn't looking at these things, but someone in the community might notice and bring it to the school's attention.\n\nThere's no invasion of privacy when something is brought to the school's attention. If you don't want something to be seen, don't put it online. You can't tell people what to think or take seriously. The school officials aren't supposed to be monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IM's, but if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nFor example, a few months ago, someone overheard something in the school and got worried. They went through the person's Facebook and found something that was meant as a joke but became serious in light of the situation. If something is brought to the school's attention, there's no invasion of privacy, because the information was made public.\n\nTeachers shouldn't be creating accounts under different names and becoming friends with their students. I wouldn't friend my residents on Facebook for the same reason. I don't want to see what they're doing or posting, like going out and drinking. If it's brought to their attention, though, the school has to take it seriously.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out far too long. I think the original intent was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we've strayed from that purpose. Now, it seems like we're just fighting to prove our status as a superpower. The initial motivations were questionable, involving previous tensions between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to democratize a country with an unfair political system, that would be a valid reason for the war. However, I think our original objectives have become distorted, and we're now stuck in a conflict with an unclear endgame. We're still at war, not because we must, but because we don't want to retreat without a decisive victory. It's been drawn out for too long. The government there now needs to stand on its own, and we should focus on our own economic struggles. We're spending billions that could be better used on our own issues, like poverty and public infrastructure. The war is a long-term drain on our economy, and there are pressing domestic issues that need our attention. It's time to bring our troops home.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems like something was prevented because someone went online and found something, right? Like, maybe it was something on a site like Myspace? Well, I mean, if you post something on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see, right? I understand that on Myspace, you usually have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you've accepted them as a friend, they have permission to see it. So, whenever you put information online, you have to understand that a lot of people might see it. In this case, I think it was actually good that someone found the information and prevented a life from being lost. It's a tough situation, though. How can you have one person looking at everyone's profiles all day to prevent that? That could lead to discrimination if they focus on the \"bad kids.\" I don't think it would be right to have someone's job be to look at profiles. But maybe it depends on what they found and why. Were they looking for evidence of something? I don't know. I don't have a Myspace, but I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I saw something on TV where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and talk to her within minutes. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I've had people in my classes who knew my screen name and sent me messages. They know my interests, what I look like, and even where I am during the day. It's hard because you think they know all about you. I try to limit what I put up there, but I want to communicate with my friends, so it's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might look at what.\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard my roommate mentioning that her high school students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and it struck me as a bit strange. How could school officials tell their students they weren't allowed to have it? I don't really know if that's a privacy issue, but I'm not sure they had the right to tell people they couldn't have it. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have a couple more points to discuss about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing this up\nI hate to admit it\nBut I was against the war from the start\nUm\nBut it's not as important now\nBecause the general consensus is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration\nAnd they don't want to admit they were wrong\nUm\nYou just have to look at the polls\nThey've done U.S. polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls\nAnd about 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\n80 percent of Iraqis\nUm\n70 percent of the troops over there think it was a dumb idea, and they want us to pull out within the year\nUm\nI don't know\nIt's just been a complete disaster from the beginning\nIt was already a disaster before we even went in\nAnd now pulling out is going to be a disaster too\nThere's no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI think it's just the culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states\nThe gap is too big for the administration, or previous ones, to understand\nAnd they think they can just bring Democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist\nUm\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will just turn into a disaster\nLike quicksand\nUm\nI don't even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don't see a reason to stay\nI'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas as to why we should stay\nBut I haven't heard a legitimate reason\nUm\nIf they want to do it gradually over a year or a bit longer\nI wouldn't really have a problem with that\nBut I just don't see a reason to stay any longer than that\nUm\nI mean, I read that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them think we should leave now\nUm\nThese are the people we're trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nYou know, I think they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out after that, we'll be the good guys\nWell, not really, no\nBut at least we won't be in the situation we're in now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I certainly believe that gender discrimination remains a significant issue in the United States. It’s not just about women; it extends to various fields of work. For instance, women often struggle to ascend to positions that they qualify for, as society is conditioned to view men as better suited for leadership roles in the business world. Similarly, men face challenges when they step into roles like stay-at-home dads or work in the fashion industry, where their expertise is often questioned. This isn’t confined to gender but extends to other factors like socioeconomic background. While we’ve made progress, change is slow. We can continue to promote acceptance by highlighting the positive attributes of those who defy societal norms without being too forceful. I believe we’re at a good balance where these changes are starting to be accepted. It’s a slow process, but we’re making progress. Discrimination isn’t just about gender; it also involves factors like where you come from and your background.",
            "Understood, they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. It's like going from a criminal offense to getting a traffic ticket. Catching someone with a drug charge could lead to job interview ramifications, but the worst ones usually don't disappear when it's decriminalized. There's an argument that arresting and processing people is expensive. It costs a lot to book, house, and process them, and even more to go through court and appoint a public defender. Municipalities might not make these concessions, even if it could free up money for other programs. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal, it's okay. They have more money now for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Marijuana isn't something you want to be everywhere, but there's a financial element to it. If it were totally legal, it could be sold in gas stations, leading to more people smoking and driving under its influence—something that's still taboo in many places. I think marijuana has a more adverse effect on lifestyle than just motor skills. Everyone reacts differently, and some people exercise moderation while others don't. Both substances have their adverse effects, and it's hard to generalize due to differing reactions.",
            "I would say yes, for sure. A lot of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing them for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week and they're quite strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That's not really being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So it might be a different realm, but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well, I guess people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's about children, which is different than a spouse. If you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope.",
            "Well, I'm still on the fence about this whole debate on marriage. I haven't formed a solid opinion yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. But I must admit, this is one of the trickiest topics we're facing today, especially when it comes to the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. It's so sensitive that it's hard to discuss without offending someone.\n\nI think all civil unions should be looked at the same way by the government, just like a civil union. If you're married, I believe they should just treat it as a civil union, because that's essentially what it is - two people united. They shouldn't differentiate it based on the type of ceremony or belief system involved.\n\nAnd as for gay marriage, it's just another form of a civil union, really. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion about this, then it makes sense to push for federal recognition. However, I don't think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is necessary or appropriate. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution for such a cause.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit nuanced for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not fully agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized and that it shouldn't be a national issue. I think the decision should be left to each state rather than the president dictating it for the entire country.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican, and it's clear which side of the issue they lean towards. If you live in a democratic state, you're well aware of its stance on gay marriage. So, if a state decides to legalize it, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and as such, I think gay marriage should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI don't feel as though former President Bush should have decided that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think he should have the power to dictate how each state runs itself, as he doesn't live in every single state. Plus, he's leaving office soon, and if a democratic president decides to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. I believe that some things should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will be most affected by their decision.",
            "Um, no, I don't think so.\nUm, let me see, I guess the thing is...\nMyspace is a public space, you know?\nLike, if you look at the definition of a bulletin board, it's basically for public display.\nUm, so if you post something on the internet, you have to understand that people, especially school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not.\nUm, and even if they weren't doing it under the school's name, they could still access it through their own homes, you know?\nBut, with something like trying to prevent a school shooting, well, as long as it saves lives or makes the school a safer place, I think that's perfectly fine.\nI mean, if they're just going on there to catch students for doing something they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking, then I feel like that's an invasion of privacy.\nBut if they're doing it to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all.\nUm, I mean, it's a public space, so you have to expect that people will see what you post.\nUm, like, if you're posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's kind of ridiculous.\nUm, I mean, everything you post on the internet can come back to haunt you, you know?\nUm, like, if you're a college student and you post something that you don't want to be seen by the public later on, that can come back to bite you in the butt, you know?\nUm, like, once it's on the internet, it's there forever.\nUm, so you have to be careful about what you put out there.\nUm, like, I've had discussions with teachers about this, especially when I was in high school.\nUm, they said they have to make sure stuff like this is safe, you know?\nLike, they have to do lockdown drills and stuff because of the terrorist attacks.\nUm, and even though that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's still important to be safe about it.\nUm, so, the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, you know?\nUm, like, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that.\nUm, so, that's basically what I was trying to say, you know?",
            "In the beginning, the war seemed like a good idea to me, especially considering the personal impact of nine eleven. I was all for going over there and creating as much chaos as they did for us. However, I think we overlooked many things and didn't really think about the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared and without a clear plan, and I believe it backfired on us. Now, I'm very much against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. The people over there, they're fighting with each other, and I don't think us being there will stop that. They're just looking to get us out of there, and I think that should be fine. We just need to leave. I think we were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. We didn't consider what this could lead to or how they would react to our presence. The president, at the time, was driven by public sentiment and his own desire to act. I understand that, but I think we could have had a better plan. We really didn't know what we were supposed to do to create order. There was no unity or clear purpose. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always going to be like that. We're not making enough progress, and I think no matter how long we stay, once we leave, it will collapse. We can't stay there forever. I don't think we're doing ourselves any good by staying there."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church could make changes. They have been discussing the decline in their following, and I think it's due to their stance on several issues that aren't very accepting. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional. I believe that if they were to adopt a more modern perspective, they would be less concerned about losing their followers. Many people are turning away from the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues. For example, if you support abortion or believe in gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a church that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented some of the issues they've faced. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have the same. Let's face it, they are already devoted to God, so what's the harm in having a family life too?",
            "Well, let me share my thoughts on the matter. Personally, I'm not against gay marriage. I mean, it just doesn't seem like it's something that people choose to be. They're either born that way or whatever, and I don't think they should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, it doesn't make sense to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It just feels wrong to me to make that distinction.\n\nI haven't really given the topic a great deal of thought, but I would definitely say it's wrong to say that. It's not like they choose to be this way. I mean, I was born straight, and other people are born gay, and it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue. It's not like it affects the security of our country or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place to me. They don't have any right to interject in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. It's how they were born, or at least that's what I believe. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling argument against it. Some people claim that gay couples threaten the traditional family structure, but this is a misguided view. The dynamics of homosexual relationships are as varied and nuanced as those of heterosexual couples. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but they're not the same thing.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights issues at stake. For instance, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions on your behalf because they're not considered family. This is absurd if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many studies have shown that gay couples experience the same level of relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe confusion often stems from the fact that people believe gay couples are asking for religious ceremonies, but that's not the case. They're simply asking for a legal document that recognizes their commitment. If there's no religious involvement, this shouldn't be a sticking point. It's akin to segregation; separate but unequal.\n\nAdditionally, concerns about adoption and community integration are misplaced. The main issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and society at large. In some areas, they face significant challenges. For example, children of gay parents in New York City have special schools because they're often bullied in regular public schools. However, this doesn't mean that parenting skills are any different in gay couples than in straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should play a role in this matter, ensuring that gay marriage is legal in every state. I think the current amendment should be amended to allow for gay marriage. However, President Bush's strong religious views on the subject complicate the issue. His stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research, which are predominantly moral arguments. While morality is a personal matter, it should not dictate government policy.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to false beliefs that gay people are psychologically damaged or had traumatic experiences in their childhood. However, these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people were to rely on actual research rather than popular culture and religious beliefs, their perspectives might shift.",

            "In my opinion, the church has evolved quite a bit to adapt to the twenty-first century and it's not as strict as it once was. Growing up, I remember going to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses with matching shoes and a purse, and seeing all my friends there on weekends. Now, the church has changed. They've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes and people dress more casually, especially during the summer when some come straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now, making the atmosphere a lot more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been completely prevented merely by allowing female priests or priests to marry. The problem isn't so much about the church's rules but the individual. Even married men can be attracted to children, and I think this is something rooted in their genetics. I believe that pedophilia is largely a genetic predisposition, not something that can be influenced by societal changes. If priests were allowed to marry, it might just delay the issue for a time, but it wouldn't change the underlying problem. I think the church could have done more to handle these situations transparently rather than trying to cover them up. However, not all cases were necessarily known or handled that way. As for any other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other significant insights to share.",
            "Initially, I was alright with the Iraq War scenario. However, in the wake of September 11th, the Bush administration connected the Iraq War with Osama Bin Laden and falsely accused Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction. This pretext for the war has since proven to be false, and it really rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for their actions. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. This is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has openly disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. They seemed to have come into office with a determination to go to war. One of their former officials, a Treasury Secretary, even hinted at this in a book he wrote after being ousted. It's clear the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and he also wanted to expand our energy supply. I think this war has continued long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to a civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, also seems problematic. Iraq's sovereignty could become an issue, and the interim government isn't in a strong position to maintain stability. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and radical elements continue to vie for control. There's a lot of unrest and friction in the political process.",
            "In all honesty, I find it quite challenging to have a clear stance on the War in Iraq. Let me see, it's not like I'm an expert on the matter, but I'll try to put my thoughts into words. At the moment, I feel it's almost pointless because it's not even a declared war; it's just like a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing. I mean, who did the terrorist attacks on Nine Eleven? It seems like we're still over there to try and build democracy and maybe secure some oil, but I don't feel like it's the right reason to stay.\n\nI mean, I’m not really a big fan of the War on Iraq, and with the lack of focus on the details, it’s a little difficult to form a strong opinion. But at this point, I know we're over there to try and create a democracy, which is a lengthy process, and to get some oil. However, I think it's just making everyone upset, and if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever.\n\nIf we leave, we'll have messed up everything, and they'll have to start from scratch on their own. It’s such a delicate situation. What if we leave? They'll be mad at us for screwing up their country, and they might not be able to fix it on their own. Then they'll have to deal with all the chaos, like little groups killing each other because of differing beliefs.\n\nI guess it's hard to say if we should stay or go. I want it to end because there are so many families with children in Iraq, and they're suffering. But at the same time, they have a different culture than us, and if we stay, we're just trying to mold them into a second United States, which could make things worse. It's like Al-Qaeda will just grow stronger, and their hatred towards the U.S. will increase.\n\nIt’s hard to find the right path in this situation. I think it's going to go on for many more years, and it's just an endless cycle of trying to help and making things worse. That's about it, I guess.",
            "To be honest, I’m not convinced that it’s right to legalize or even allow states to make it legal. I believe it’s more up to the churches to decide this, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce power over it would be in defiance of what’s already been said and written in stone. I also think that it would be a form of discrimination if the government were to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state has always been a key aspect of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don’t believe that any amendment related to this matter would be right, as it would likely be used to restrict people rather than the government. Furthermore, I don’t see any reason for the federal government or any government to be involved in this issue, except perhaps for personal belief reasons, which I believe is unfair. It’s not about impacting the economy or society; it’s about personal beliefs. I think it’s best left to the churches to decide, not the government.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality, one didn’t have that much to do with the other. The government made it seem that way to play on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that. The war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. What they were doing was removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nThe United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government. It’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and upholding or implementing democracy.\nAnd it’s going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because there are insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting the citizens in the country.\nSo first of all, I think we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases. But if you are going to go to war, you need to be prepared for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They weren’t planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today and many American troops are still dying.\nMany Iraqis wanted the US to come in. We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. How can we abandon them now? It’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq? Going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think it’s because of the oil issue. It’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nIn the election of 2004, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in there, how can we abandon these people? We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. So it’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\nI hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal preference and more of a biological trait than something chosen. It's not fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or government should interfere at this level. It's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like anyone else. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush claim to interpret the meaning of marriage, especially when two people can marry secretly without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to marry, it becomes a national issue. I believe it should be a private, personal matter, not a public one. I don't think it's fair to make it such a big deal.",

The internet is visible to everyone, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their bulletin. If something serious is said, the school has to act on it, even if it seems like a joke. There's no invasion of privacy when it's brought to their attention, but if you don't want something out there, you shouldn't post it. You can't control what people think or how seriously they take your posts. Personally, I think school officials shouldn't be friends with students online or snooping through their profiles, but if a concern is raised, they have to take it seriously. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal activities, and it's not my place to police their actions online.",
            "I feel that the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal and are now at war merely to assert our status as a superpower. The original motivations may have been tainted by personal interests, notably George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the true purpose was to bring democracy, it was a just cause, but the war has become a protracted affair, with the initial goals diluted. The war has dragged on for years, and I believe it's time to end it. The country's officials should now take the lead. We've been draining our own resources, spending billions on a war that no longer aligns with our original purpose. There are pressing issues at home that need our attention, such as poverty and infrastructure improvement. The money being spent on this war could be much better allocated to domestic issues.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nWell, I'm not sure if this happened because someone went online and found something, but okay, let me ask you.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post personal information, it's generally available for anyone to see. I mean, you have to accept that when you're sharing something online.\n\nI understand that you might need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but if that's the case, you've already given them permission to see it.\n\nSo, whenever you put something on the internet, you should know that many people are going to see it. If someone saw something online that helped prevent a life being lost, that's tough because it's not like you can't have one person sitting around looking at everyone's profiles all day.\n\nIt becomes a form of discrimination if you think, \"Let's check the bad kids to make sure they're not up to anything.\" However, it all depends on the situation they stumbled upon the profile in. Maybe they were just casually browsing or looking for evidence that a student was planning something.\n\nI don't have a Myspace myself, but I do use Facebook. It bothers me knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I've seen a TV show where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and even convinced her to meet him in less than a minute. I would never do that, but I know people in my class who I don't recognize but know my screen name. It's hard because they might know my interests, what I look like, and even my daily schedule.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also want to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue because I only accept friend requests from people I know. You never know who can see what.\n\nOne of my roommates told me that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by the school. I thought that was a bit strange. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have a Myspace.\n\nIt just feels like an invasion of privacy, and I'm not sure if they have that authority. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "Well, I guess I only have two things to talk about concerning the Iraq War. I mean, it's not easy to discuss because I feel like a hypocrite joining in on the \"I was against it from the start\" crowd. But, let's face it, it's just not that significant anymore, right?\n\nI mean, almost everyone agrees that it was a bad idea. Look at the polls – 75 to 80% of the world thinks it was a mistake, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the troops over there. It's been a complete mess since the beginning, and pulling out will also be a disaster. The Middle East is just too complicated. The culture clash is huge, and previous administrations didn't seem to get that. It's like they thought they could just march in and impose democracy, but it's not that simple.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. We got stuck in quicksand over there. I don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have some ideas on why we should stay, but so far I haven't heard a good one.\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and at least a quarter want us to go now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Shouldn't we at least listen to them? And if we do leave, we'll be the good guys, you know, if something goes wrong, we can say we were going to stay but they wanted us to leave.\n\nBut, you know, we'll probably never be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But it's better than where we are now.",
            "I do indeed believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; I think it also affects individuals in specific fields and regions. For instance, many women struggle with the \"glass ceiling\" in professional environments, where even qualified candidates are passed over for promotions due to societal expectations. Similarly, men in certain industries, such as fashion, often face skepticism and lower expectations because of traditional gender roles. I believe that change is gradual, but it is happening. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being more accepted in the business world, as are men who choose to stay at home to care for their children. However, promoting these changes takes time and must be done subtly, without forcing the issue. Discrimination also exists based on socioeconomic background and education, with those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds facing additional challenges. Despite these obstacles, progress is being made, and society is slowly adopting more inclusive attitudes.",
            "It seems to me that they haven’t made it legal, but they've decriminalized it, which means that having marijuana has been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. Basically, if you get caught, you'll be cited rather than arrested and brought in for booking. This change in classification can have significant implications, especially with job interviews and other situations where a drug charge could be a major negative. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate these legal concerns, it does reduce the severity of them. On the other hand, there's an argument that it's a cost-effective change for municipalities, given that arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is expensive. This financial aspect can be particularly appealing for communities that are under financial strain. For instance, in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more liberal, decriminalizing marijuana can lead to greater financial resources for public education, social programs, and assistance for the elderly and homeless. While I understand that marijuana shouldn't be openly sold and smoked on the streets due to its taboo nature in many places, I think the financial benefits are worth considering. However, it's important to note that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects on individuals, and it's difficult to generalize about how people react to substances. Unlike alcohol, marijuana might have a more significant impact on lifestyle than just motor skills.",
            "I'd agree that yes, a lot of the things the Catholic Church does are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a positive aspect. By maintaining these traditions, they stay connected to their history and values. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable and open to change. A significant portion of Catholics believe that attending Church every week is mandatory, and they adhere strictly to the rules and practices. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to a lack of acceptance towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or belong to other religions. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage couldn't be blessed in the Catholic Church due to my dad's Episcopalian background. While the Church teaches to love others, their actions often contradict this by not accepting those who are not \"perfect\" Catholics or belong to other religions. This paradoxical approach can make it feel outdated and hypocritical. I believe that, at least in theory, allowing priests to marry might be a good idea. However, I'm not convinced that it would solve the issue of pedophilic behavior among priests. Child molestation is a separate issue from marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily deter such behavior, as it's more about the individual's personal inclinations than their marital status. I don't think priests would suddenly stop molesting children just because they're married.",
            "Oh, I'm still undecided on this issue, to be honest. It's such a divisive topic, straddling the delicate line between church and state, and how we define marriage. I mean, it's tricky to talk about without stepping on someone's toes. I don't know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as they are, without any government interference. I mean, if two people are united, it shouldn't matter what kind of union it is, right? And if all states can agree on a solution, then they should push for a federal law. But amending the constitution just to ban gay marriage? That's just absurd! The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that's not a broad enough cause to warrant it. It's just not important enough to change the constitution over. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so like many others, the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a grey area for me. While I have several gay friends, I personally don't align with that lifestyle, but I do believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be an issue at the national level; rather, it should be left up to each state to decide. States are diverse in their political leanings, with many being democratic or republican. Democratic states are likely to favor gay marriage, while republican states might not. Living in a state, you should respect its stance on the matter since you've chosen to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have equal opportunities as heterosexuals, and based on that, I think each state should make the decision to legalize it. I don't agree with President Bush imposing his views on the entire country on this matter. He shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should run itself, as he won't be around forever. If a Democratic president reverses the ban on gay marriage, it would just be a game of political ping-pong. It's best to leave it up to each state to decide, as they'll be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Let me put it this way, there's no doubt that Myspace is a public forum. If you look up the definition, you'll see that it's designed for public viewing. So, when you post something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. And if they're doing it to keep students safe, I see no problem with that. After all, isn't the safety of students a responsibility of the school system? But, if they're just going on the internet to catch students in trouble, I'd say that's an invasion of privacy. However, if they're using it to make the school safer, like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. I mean, if it saves lives, isn't that what's important? But, if they're using it just to catch students, that's a step too far. It's like when you're in college, you're already worried about what you say in emails. You don't want anything coming back to haunt you later. And once it's on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back. So, if they're using it to make the school safer, that's one thing. But if they're just using it to catch students, that's a different story. That's not an invasion of privacy if it's to keep the students safe.",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was quite supportive of the war because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was all for going over there and causing as much chaos as they did here. However, as time passed, I realized that we may have overlooked a lot of key factors and didn't thoughtfully consider the long-term implications. We seemed to have rushed into it without a proper plan, and I believe it ultimately backfired. I don't know if I'm being fair, but I was all for it initially. Now, I'm very much against it, as I feel it hasn't achieved anything significant. I think the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than us. They can't even manage their own lives, so I don't see how we can impose our will on them. I almost don't care about what happens over there now. It's like, they fight among themselves, and that's that. We definitely went over there unprepared, not knowing what to expect. War is different for them; they're more brutal, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. I think it would be best for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people demanded it, and he felt he had to act. At the time, I understood where he was coming from; they can't just do something like that and expect us to just let it slide. We had to respond, but I believe we could have handled it more strategically. We didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we got there. I don't think we really united behind a common goal, and that might have helped us more. Honestly, I don't think we're the right ones to change them. They'll always be the same. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but not enough to justify staying there. No matter how long we stay, it's just going to collapse once we leave. And we can't stay there forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying there. No, let's just leave."

heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church could make changes. They have been discussing the decline in their following, and I think it's due to their stance on several issues that aren't very accepting. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional. I believe that if they were to adopt a more modern perspective, they would be less concerned about losing their followers. Many people are turning away from the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues. For example, if you support abortion or believe in gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a church that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented some of the issues they've faced. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have the same. Let's face it, they are already devoted to God, so what's the harm in having a family life too?",
            "Well, let me share my thoughts on the matter. Personally, I'm not against gay marriage. I mean, it just doesn't seem like it's something that people choose to be. They're either born that way or whatever, and I don't think they should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, it doesn't make sense to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It just feels wrong to me to make that distinction.\n\nI haven't really given the topic a great deal of thought, but I would definitely say it's wrong to say that. It's not like they choose to be this way. I mean, I was born straight, and other people are born gay, and it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue. It's not like it affects the security of our country or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place to me. They don't have any right to interject in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. It's how they were born, or at least that's what I believe. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling argument against it. Some people claim that gay couples threaten the traditional family structure, but this is a misguided view. The dynamics of homosexual relationships are as varied and nuanced as those of heterosexual couples. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but they're not the same thing.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights issues at stake. For instance, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions on your behalf because they're not considered family. This is absurd if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many studies have shown that gay couples experience the same level of relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe confusion often stems from the fact that people believe gay couples are asking for religious ceremonies, but that's not the case. They're simply asking for a legal document that recognizes their commitment. If there's no religious involvement, this shouldn't be a sticking point. It's akin to segregation; separate but unequal.\n\nAdditionally, concerns about adoption and community integration are misplaced. The main issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and society at large. In some areas, they face significant challenges. For example, children of gay parents in New York City have special schools because they're often bullied in regular public schools. However, this doesn't mean that parenting skills are any different in gay couples than in straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should play a role in this matter, ensuring that gay marriage is legal in every state. I think the current amendment should be amended to allow for gay marriage. However, President Bush's strong religious views on the subject complicate the issue. His stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research, which are predominantly moral arguments. While morality is a personal matter, it should not dictate government policy.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to false beliefs that gay people are psychologically damaged or had traumatic experiences in their childhood. However, these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people were to rely on actual research rather than popular culture and religious beliefs, their perspectives might shift.",

            "In my opinion, the church has evolved quite a bit to adapt to the twenty-first century and it's not as strict as it once was. Growing up, I remember going to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses with matching shoes and a purse, and seeing all my friends there on weekends. Now, the church has changed. They've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes and people dress more casually, especially during the summer when some come straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now, making the atmosphere a lot more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been completely prevented merely by allowing female priests or priests to marry. The problem isn't so much about the church's rules but the individual. Even married men can be attracted to children, and I think this is something rooted in their genetics. I believe that pedophilia is largely a genetic predisposition, not something that can be influenced by societal changes. If priests were allowed to marry, it might just delay the issue for a time, but it wouldn't change the underlying problem. I think the church could have done more to handle these situations transparently rather than trying to cover them up. However, not all cases were necessarily known or handled that way. As for any other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other significant insights to share.",
            "Initially, I was alright with the Iraq War scenario. However, in the wake of September 11th, the Bush administration connected the Iraq War with Osama Bin Laden and falsely accused Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction. This pretext for the war has since proven to be false, and it really rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for their actions. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. This is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has openly disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. They seemed to have come into office with a determination to go to war. One of their former officials, a Treasury Secretary, even hinted at this in a book he wrote after being ousted. It's clear the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and he also wanted to expand our energy supply. I think this war has continued long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to a civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, also seems problematic. Iraq's sovereignty could become an issue, and the interim government isn't in a strong position to maintain stability. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and radical elements continue to vie for control. There's a lot of unrest and friction in the political process.",
            "In all honesty, I find it quite challenging to have a clear stance on the War in Iraq. Let me see, it's not like I'm an expert on the matter, but I'll try to put my thoughts into words. At the moment, I feel it's almost pointless because it's not even a declared war; it's just like a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing. I mean, who did the terrorist attacks on Nine Eleven? It seems like we're still over there to try and build democracy and maybe secure some oil, but I don't feel like it's the right reason to stay.\n\nI mean, I’m not really a big fan of the War on Iraq, and with the lack of focus on the details, it’s a little difficult to form a strong opinion. But at this point, I know we're over there to try and create a democracy, which is a lengthy process, and to get some oil. However, I think it's just making everyone upset, and if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever.\n\nIf we leave, we'll have messed up everything, and they'll have to start from scratch on their own. It’s such a delicate situation. What if we leave? They'll be mad at us for screwing up their country, and they might not be able to fix it on their own. Then they'll have to deal with all the chaos, like little groups killing each other because of differing beliefs.\n\nI guess it's hard to say if we should stay or go. I want it to end because there are so many families with children in Iraq, and they're suffering. But at the same time, they have a different culture than us, and if we stay, we're just trying to mold them into a second United States, which could make things worse. It's like Al-Qaeda will just grow stronger, and their hatred towards the U.S. will increase.\n\nIt’s hard to find the right path in this situation. I think it's going to go on for many more years, and it's just an endless cycle of trying to help and making things worse. That's about it, I guess.",
            "To be honest, I’m not convinced that it’s right to legalize or even allow states to make it legal. I believe it’s more up to the churches to decide this, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce power over it would be in defiance of what’s already been said and written in stone. I also think that it would be a form of discrimination if the government were to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state has always been a key aspect of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don’t believe that any amendment related to this matter would be right, as it would likely be used to restrict people rather than the government. Furthermore, I don’t see any reason for the federal government or any government to be involved in this issue, except perhaps for personal belief reasons, which I believe is unfair. It’s not about impacting the economy or society; it’s about personal beliefs. I think it’s best left to the churches to decide, not the government.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality, one didn’t have that much to do with the other. The government made it seem that way to play on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that. The war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. What they were doing was removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nThe United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government. It’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and upholding or implementing democracy.\nAnd it’s going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because there are insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting the citizens in the country.\nSo first of all, I think we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases. But if you are going to go to war, you need to be prepared for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They weren’t planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today and many American troops are still dying.\nMany Iraqis wanted the US to come in. We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. How can we abandon them now? It’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq? Going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think it’s because of the oil issue. It’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nIn the election of 2004, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in there, how can we abandon these people? We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. So it’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\nI hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal preference and more of a biological trait than something chosen. It's not fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or government should interfere at this level. It's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like anyone else. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush claim to interpret the meaning of marriage, especially when two people can marry secretly without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to marry, it becomes a national issue. I believe it should be a private, personal matter, not a public one. I don't think it's fair to make it such a big deal.",
            "When you post something online, it's public knowledge. As an R.A., I've encountered this firsthand. Whatever you put out there is going to influence people's opinions of you, especially if it's about sensitive topics like shootings or bomb threats. The internet is visible to everyone, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their bulletin. If something serious is said, the school has to act on it, even if it seems like a joke. There's no invasion of privacy when it's brought to their attention, but if you don't want something out there, you shouldn't post it. You can't control what people think or how seriously they take your posts. Personally, I think school officials shouldn't be friends with students online or snooping through their profiles, but if a concern is raised, they have to take it seriously. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal activities, and it's not my place to police their actions online.",
            "I feel that the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal and are now at war merely to assert our status as a superpower. The original motivations may have been tainted by personal interests, notably George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the true purpose was to bring democracy, it was a just cause, but the war has become a protracted affair, with the initial goals diluted. The war has dragged on for years, and I believe it's time to end it. The country's officials should now take the lead. We've been draining our own resources, spending billions on a war that no longer aligns with our original purpose. There are pressing issues at home that need our attention, such as poverty and infrastructure improvement. The money being spent on this war could be much better allocated to domestic issues.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nWell, I'm not sure if this happened because someone went online and found something, but okay, let me ask you.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post personal information, it's generally available for anyone to see. I mean, you have to accept that when you're sharing something online.\n\nI understand that you might need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but if that's the case, you've already given them permission to see it.\n\nSo, whenever you put something on the internet, you should know that many people are going to see it. If someone saw something online that helped prevent a life being lost, that's tough because it's not like you can't have one person sitting around looking at everyone's profiles all day.\n\nIt becomes a form of discrimination if you think, \"Let's check the bad kids to make sure they're not up to anything.\" However, it all depends on the situation they stumbled upon the profile in. Maybe they were just casually browsing or looking for evidence that a student was planning something.\n\nI don't have a Myspace myself, but I do use Facebook. It bothers me knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I've seen a TV show where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and even convinced her to meet him in less than a minute. I would never do that, but I know people in my class who I don't recognize but know my screen name. It's hard because they might know my interests, what I look like, and even my daily schedule.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also want to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue because I only accept friend requests from people I know. You never know who can see what.\n\nOne of my roommates told me that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by the school. I thought that was a bit strange. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have a Myspace.\n\nIt just feels like an invasion of privacy, and I'm not sure if they have that authority. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "Well, I guess I only have two things to talk about concerning the Iraq War. I mean, it's not easy to discuss because I feel like a hypocrite joining in on the \"I was against it from the start\" crowd. But, let's face it, it's just not that significant anymore, right?\n\nI mean, almost everyone agrees that it was a bad idea. Look at the polls – 75 to 80% of the world thinks it was a mistake, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the troops over there. It's been a complete mess since the beginning, and pulling out will also be a disaster. The Middle East is just too complicated. The culture clash is huge, and previous administrations didn't seem to get that. It's like they thought they could just march in and impose democracy, but it's not that simple.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. We got stuck in quicksand over there. I don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have some ideas on why we should stay, but so far I haven't heard a good one.\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and at least a quarter want us to go now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Shouldn't we at least listen to them? And if we do leave, we'll be the good guys, you know, if something goes wrong, we can say we were going to stay but they wanted us to leave.\n\nBut, you know, we'll probably never be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But it's better than where we are now.",
            "I do indeed believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; I think it also affects individuals in specific fields and regions. For instance, many women struggle with the \"glass ceiling\" in professional environments, where even qualified candidates are passed over for promotions due to societal expectations. Similarly, men in certain industries, such as fashion, often face skepticism and lower expectations because of traditional gender roles. I believe that change is gradual, but it is happening. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being more accepted in the business world, as are men who choose to stay at home to care for their children. However, promoting these changes takes time and must be done subtly, without forcing the issue. Discrimination also exists based on socioeconomic background and education, with those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds facing additional challenges. Despite these obstacles, progress is being made, and society is slowly adopting more inclusive attitudes.",
            "It seems to me that they haven’t made it legal, but they've decriminalized it, which means that having marijuana has been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. Basically, if you get caught, you'll be cited rather than arrested and brought in for booking. This change in classification can have significant implications, especially with job interviews and other situations where a drug charge could be a major negative. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate these legal concerns, it does reduce the severity of them. On the other hand, there's an argument that it's a cost-effective change for municipalities, given that arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is expensive. This financial aspect can be particularly appealing for communities that are under financial strain. For instance, in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more liberal, decriminalizing marijuana can lead to greater financial resources for public education, social programs, and assistance for the elderly and homeless. While I understand that marijuana shouldn't be openly sold and smoked on the streets due to its taboo nature in many places, I think the financial benefits are worth considering. However, it's important to note that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects on individuals, and it's difficult to generalize about how people react to substances. Unlike alcohol, marijuana might have a more significant impact on lifestyle than just motor skills.",
            "I'd agree that yes, a lot of the things the Catholic Church does are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a positive aspect. By maintaining these traditions, they stay connected to their history and values. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable and open to change. A significant portion of Catholics believe that attending Church every week is mandatory, and they adhere strictly to the rules and practices. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to a lack of acceptance towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or belong to other religions. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage couldn't be blessed in the Catholic Church due to my dad's Episcopalian background. While the Church teaches to love others, their actions often contradict this by not accepting those who are not \"perfect\" Catholics or belong to other religions. This paradoxical approach can make it feel outdated and hypocritical. I believe that, at least in theory, allowing priests to marry might be a good idea. However, I'm not convinced that it would solve the issue of pedophilic behavior among priests. Child molestation is a separate issue from marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily deter such behavior, as it's more about the individual's personal inclinations than their marital status. I don't think priests would suddenly stop molesting children just because they're married.",
            "Oh, I'm still undecided on this issue, to be honest. It's such a divisive topic, straddling the delicate line between church and state, and how we define marriage. I mean, it's tricky to talk about without stepping on someone's toes. I don't know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as they are, without any government interference. I mean, if two people are united, it shouldn't matter what kind of union it is, right? And if all states can agree on a solution, then they should push for a federal law. But amending the constitution just to ban gay marriage? That's just absurd! The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that's not a broad enough cause to warrant it. It's just not important enough to change the constitution over. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so like many others, the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a grey area for me. While I have several gay friends, I personally don't align with that lifestyle, but I do believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be an issue at the national level; rather, it should be left up to each state to decide. States are diverse in their political leanings, with many being democratic or republican. Democratic states are likely to favor gay marriage, while republican states might not. Living in a state, you should respect its stance on the matter since you've chosen to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have equal opportunities as heterosexuals, and based on that, I think each state should make the decision to legalize it. I don't agree with President Bush imposing his views on the entire country on this matter. He shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should run itself, as he won't be around forever. If a Democratic president reverses the ban on gay marriage, it would just be a game of political ping-pong. It's best to leave it up to each state to decide, as they'll be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Let me put it this way, there's no doubt that Myspace is a public forum. If you look up the definition, you'll see that it's designed for public viewing. So, when you post something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. And if they're doing it to keep students safe, I see no problem with that. After all, isn't the safety of students a responsibility of the school system? But, if they're just going on the internet to catch students in trouble, I'd say that's an invasion of privacy. However, if they're using it to make the school safer, like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. I mean, if it saves lives, isn't that what's important? But, if they're using it just to catch students, that's a step too far. It's like when you're in college, you're already worried about what you say in emails. You don't want anything coming back to haunt you later. And once it's on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back. So, if they're using it to make the school safer, that's one thing. But if they're just using it to catch students, that's a different story. That's not an invasion of privacy if it's to keep the students safe.",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was quite supportive of the war because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was all for going over there and causing as much chaos as they did here. However, as time passed, I realized that we may have overlooked a lot of key factors and didn't thoughtfully consider the long-term implications. We seemed to have rushed into it without a proper plan, and I believe it ultimately backfired. I don't know if I'm being fair, but I was all for it initially. Now, I'm very much against it, as I feel it hasn't achieved anything significant. I think the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than us. They can't even manage their own lives, so I don't see how we can impose our will on them. I almost don't care about what happens over there now. It's like, they fight among themselves, and that's that. We definitely went over there unprepared, not knowing what to expect. War is different for them; they're more brutal, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. I think it would be best for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people demanded it, and he felt he had to act. At the time, I understood where he was coming from; they can't just do something like that and expect us to just let it slide. We had to respond, but I believe we could have handled it more strategically. We didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we got there. I don't think we really united behind a common goal, and that might have helped us more. Honestly, I don't think we're the right ones to change them. They'll always be the same. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but not enough to justify staying there. No matter how long we stay, it's just going to collapse once we leave. And we can't stay there forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying there. No, let's just leave."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that there are a few aspects where the Catholic Church could make changes. They have been discussing the decline in their following, and I think it's due to their stance on several issues that aren't very accepting. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional. I believe that if they were to adopt a more modern perspective, they would be less concerned about losing their followers. Many people are turning away from the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues. For example, if you support abortion or believe in gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a church that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented some of the issues they've faced. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have the same. Let's face it, they are already devoted to God, so what's the harm in having a family life too?",
            "Well, let me share my thoughts on the matter. Personally, I'm not against gay marriage. I mean, it just doesn't seem like it's something that people choose to be. They're either born that way or whatever, and I don't think they should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, it doesn't make sense to me to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It just feels wrong to me to make that distinction.\n\nI haven't really given the topic a great deal of thought, but I would definitely say it's wrong to say that. It's not like they choose to be this way. I mean, I was born straight, and other people are born gay, and it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for.\n\nI would definitely think it's wrong to do that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue. It's not like it affects the security of our country or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place to me. They don't have any right to interject in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. It's how they were born, or at least that's what I believe. And they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling argument against it. Some people claim that gay couples threaten the traditional family structure, but this is a misguided view. The dynamics of homosexual relationships are as varied and nuanced as those of heterosexual couples. It's like comparing apples and oranges; they're both fruit, but they're not the same thing.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous civil rights issues at stake. For instance, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions on your behalf because they're not considered family. This is absurd if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many studies have shown that gay couples experience the same level of relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe confusion often stems from the fact that people believe gay couples are asking for religious ceremonies, but that's not the case. They're simply asking for a legal document that recognizes their commitment. If there's no religious involvement, this shouldn't be a sticking point. It's akin to segregation; separate but unequal.\n\nAdditionally, concerns about adoption and community integration are misplaced. The main issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and society at large. In some areas, they face significant challenges. For example, children of gay parents in New York City have special schools because they're often bullied in regular public schools. However, this doesn't mean that parenting skills are any different in gay couples than in straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should play a role in this matter, ensuring that gay marriage is legal in every state. I think the current amendment should be amended to allow for gay marriage. However, President Bush's strong religious views on the subject complicate the issue. His stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research, which are predominantly moral arguments. While morality is a personal matter, it should not dictate government policy.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to false beliefs that gay people are psychologically damaged or had traumatic experiences in their childhood. However, these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people were to rely on actual research rather than popular culture and religious beliefs, their perspectives might shift.",

            "In my opinion, the church has evolved quite a bit to adapt to the twenty-first century and it's not as strict as it once was. Growing up, I remember going to church every Sunday, dressed up in cute little dresses with matching shoes and a purse, and seeing all my friends there on weekends. Now, the church has changed. They've introduced a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes and people dress more casually, especially during the summer when some come straight from the beach. Even at the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis now, making the atmosphere a lot more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been completely prevented merely by allowing female priests or priests to marry. The problem isn't so much about the church's rules but the individual. Even married men can be attracted to children, and I think this is something rooted in their genetics. I believe that pedophilia is largely a genetic predisposition, not something that can be influenced by societal changes. If priests were allowed to marry, it might just delay the issue for a time, but it wouldn't change the underlying problem. I think the church could have done more to handle these situations transparently rather than trying to cover them up. However, not all cases were necessarily known or handled that way. As for any other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other significant insights to share.",
            "Initially, I was alright with the Iraq War scenario. However, in the wake of September 11th, the Bush administration connected the Iraq War with Osama Bin Laden and falsely accused Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction. This pretext for the war has since proven to be false, and it really rubbed me the wrong way. It just seems that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for their actions. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case to the UN, later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. This is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has openly disregarded the Constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. They seemed to have come into office with a determination to go to war. One of their former officials, a Treasury Secretary, even hinted at this in a book he wrote after being ousted. It's clear the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and he also wanted to expand our energy supply. I think this war has continued long enough, but withdrawing now might lead to a civil war and result in more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, also seems problematic. Iraq's sovereignty could become an issue, and the interim government isn't in a strong position to maintain stability. The news reports suggest the Parliament is ineffective, and radical elements continue to vie for control. There's a lot of unrest and friction in the political process.",
            "In all honesty, I find it quite challenging to have a clear stance on the War in Iraq. Let me see, it's not like I'm an expert on the matter, but I'll try to put my thoughts into words. At the moment, I feel it's almost pointless because it's not even a declared war; it's just like a big \"get back at Iraq\" thing. I mean, who did the terrorist attacks on Nine Eleven? It seems like we're still over there to try and build democracy and maybe secure some oil, but I don't feel like it's the right reason to stay.\n\nI mean, I’m not really a big fan of the War on Iraq, and with the lack of focus on the details, it’s a little difficult to form a strong opinion. But at this point, I know we're over there to try and create a democracy, which is a lengthy process, and to get some oil. However, I think it's just making everyone upset, and if we stay, we'll have to try and create democracy, which will take forever.\n\nIf we leave, we'll have messed up everything, and they'll have to start from scratch on their own. It’s such a delicate situation. What if we leave? They'll be mad at us for screwing up their country, and they might not be able to fix it on their own. Then they'll have to deal with all the chaos, like little groups killing each other because of differing beliefs.\n\nI guess it's hard to say if we should stay or go. I want it to end because there are so many families with children in Iraq, and they're suffering. But at the same time, they have a different culture than us, and if we stay, we're just trying to mold them into a second United States, which could make things worse. It's like Al-Qaeda will just grow stronger, and their hatred towards the U.S. will increase.\n\nIt’s hard to find the right path in this situation. I think it's going to go on for many more years, and it's just an endless cycle of trying to help and making things worse. That's about it, I guess.",
            "To be honest, I’m not convinced that it’s right to legalize or even allow states to make it legal. I believe it’s more up to the churches to decide this, as the Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce power over it would be in defiance of what’s already been said and written in stone. I also think that it would be a form of discrimination if the government were to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state has always been a key aspect of the Constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don’t believe that any amendment related to this matter would be right, as it would likely be used to restrict people rather than the government. Furthermore, I don’t see any reason for the federal government or any government to be involved in this issue, except perhaps for personal belief reasons, which I believe is unfair. It’s not about impacting the economy or society; it’s about personal beliefs. I think it’s best left to the churches to decide, not the government.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality, one didn’t have that much to do with the other. The government made it seem that way to play on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nI myself am pretty much against war, especially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that. The war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. What they were doing was removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nThe United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government. It’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and upholding or implementing democracy.\nAnd it’s going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because there are insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting the citizens in the country.\nSo first of all, I think we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases. But if you are going to go to war, you need to be prepared for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They weren’t planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today and many American troops are still dying.\nMany Iraqis wanted the US to come in. We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. How can we abandon them now? It’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq? Going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? I think it’s because of the oil issue. It’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nIn the election of 2004, one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. Once you go in there, how can we abandon these people? We’re the ones who took away their government and their way of life. So it’s probably something we should try to see to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\nI hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal preference and more of a biological trait than something chosen. It's not fair to deny people rights based on something they can't control. It's inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or government should interfere at this level. It's a personal and household issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like anyone else. I find it ridiculous that politicians like Bush claim to interpret the meaning of marriage, especially when two people can marry secretly without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to marry, it becomes a national issue. I believe it should be a private, personal matter, not a public one. I don't think it's fair to make it such a big deal.",
            "When you post something online, it's public knowledge. As an R.A., I've encountered this firsthand. Whatever you put out there is going to influence people's opinions of you, especially if it's about sensitive topics like shootings or bomb threats. The internet is visible to everyone, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll see their bulletin. If something serious is said, the school has to act on it, even if it seems like a joke. There's no invasion of privacy when it's brought to their attention, but if you don't want something out there, you shouldn't post it. You can't control what people think or how seriously they take your posts. Personally, I think school officials shouldn't be friends with students online or snooping through their profiles, but if a concern is raised, they have to take it seriously. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal activities, and it's not my place to police their actions online.",
            "I feel that the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal and are now at war merely to assert our status as a superpower. The original motivations may have been tainted by personal interests, notably George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the true purpose was to bring democracy, it was a just cause, but the war has become a protracted affair, with the initial goals diluted. The war has dragged on for years, and I believe it's time to end it. The country's officials should now take the lead. We've been draining our own resources, spending billions on a war that no longer aligns with our original purpose. There are pressing issues at home that need our attention, such as poverty and infrastructure improvement. The money being spent on this war could be much better allocated to domestic issues.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nWell, I'm not sure if this happened because someone went online and found something, but okay, let me ask you.\n\nUm, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post personal information, it's generally available for anyone to see. I mean, you have to accept that when you're sharing something online.\n\nI understand that you might need to be friends with someone to view their profile, but if that's the case, you've already given them permission to see it.\n\nSo, whenever you put something on the internet, you should know that many people are going to see it. If someone saw something online that helped prevent a life being lost, that's tough because it's not like you can't have one person sitting around looking at everyone's profiles all day.\n\nIt becomes a form of discrimination if you think, \"Let's check the bad kids to make sure they're not up to anything.\" However, it all depends on the situation they stumbled upon the profile in. Maybe they were just casually browsing or looking for evidence that a student was planning something.\n\nI don't have a Myspace myself, but I do use Facebook. It bothers me knowing that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. I've seen a TV show where a man proved how easily he could get information from a girl's profile and even convinced her to meet him in less than a minute. I would never do that, but I know people in my class who I don't recognize but know my screen name. It's hard because they might know my interests, what I look like, and even my daily schedule.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also want to communicate with my friends. It's a tricky issue because I only accept friend requests from people I know. You never know who can see what.\n\nOne of my roommates told me that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by the school. I thought that was a bit strange. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have a Myspace.\n\nIt just feels like an invasion of privacy, and I'm not sure if they have that authority. That's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "Well, I guess I only have two things to talk about concerning the Iraq War. I mean, it's not easy to discuss because I feel like a hypocrite joining in on the \"I was against it from the start\" crowd. But, let's face it, it's just not that significant anymore, right?\n\nI mean, almost everyone agrees that it was a bad idea. Look at the polls – 75 to 80% of the world thinks it was a mistake, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the troops over there. It's been a complete mess since the beginning, and pulling out will also be a disaster. The Middle East is just too complicated. The culture clash is huge, and previous administrations didn't seem to get that. It's like they thought they could just march in and impose democracy, but it's not that simple.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam wasn't a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country. We got stuck in quicksand over there. I don't know what to say about it anymore. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have some ideas on why we should stay, but so far I haven't heard a good one.\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and at least a quarter want us to go now. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're telling us to leave. Shouldn't we at least listen to them? And if we do leave, we'll be the good guys, you know, if something goes wrong, we can say we were going to stay but they wanted us to leave.\n\nBut, you know, we'll probably never be seen as the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But it's better than where we are now.",
            "I do indeed believe that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women; I think it also affects individuals in specific fields and regions. For instance, many women struggle with the \"glass ceiling\" in professional environments, where even qualified candidates are passed over for promotions due to societal expectations. Similarly, men in certain industries, such as fashion, often face skepticism and lower expectations because of traditional gender roles. I believe that change is gradual, but it is happening. Women are increasingly taking on higher positions and being more accepted in the business world, as are men who choose to stay at home to care for their children. However, promoting these changes takes time and must be done subtly, without forcing the issue. Discrimination also exists based on socioeconomic background and education, with those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds facing additional challenges. Despite these obstacles, progress is being made, and society is slowly adopting more inclusive attitudes.",
            "It seems to me that they haven’t made it legal, but they've decriminalized it, which means that having marijuana has been downgraded from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. Basically, if you get caught, you'll be cited rather than arrested and brought in for booking. This change in classification can have significant implications, especially with job interviews and other situations where a drug charge could be a major negative. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate these legal concerns, it does reduce the severity of them. On the other hand, there's an argument that it's a cost-effective change for municipalities, given that arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is expensive. This financial aspect can be particularly appealing for communities that are under financial strain. For instance, in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more liberal, decriminalizing marijuana can lead to greater financial resources for public education, social programs, and assistance for the elderly and homeless. While I understand that marijuana shouldn't be openly sold and smoked on the streets due to its taboo nature in many places, I think the financial benefits are worth considering. However, it's important to note that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects on individuals, and it's difficult to generalize about how people react to substances. Unlike alcohol, marijuana might have a more significant impact on lifestyle than just motor skills.",
            "I'd agree that yes, a lot of the things the Catholic Church does are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a positive aspect. By maintaining these traditions, they stay connected to their history and values. However, it's also crucial to be adaptable and open to change. A significant portion of Catholics believe that attending Church every week is mandatory, and they adhere strictly to the rules and practices. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to a lack of acceptance towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or belong to other religions. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage couldn't be blessed in the Catholic Church due to my dad's Episcopalian background. While the Church teaches to love others, their actions often contradict this by not accepting those who are not \"perfect\" Catholics or belong to other religions. This paradoxical approach can make it feel outdated and hypocritical. I believe that, at least in theory, allowing priests to marry might be a good idea. However, I'm not convinced that it would solve the issue of pedophilic behavior among priests. Child molestation is a separate issue from marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily deter such behavior, as it's more about the individual's personal inclinations than their marital status. I don't think priests would suddenly stop molesting children just because they're married.",
            "Oh, I'm still undecided on this issue, to be honest. It's such a divisive topic, straddling the delicate line between church and state, and how we define marriage. I mean, it's tricky to talk about without stepping on someone's toes. I don't know, I think civil unions should just be recognized as they are, without any government interference. I mean, if two people are united, it shouldn't matter what kind of union it is, right? And if all states can agree on a solution, then they should push for a federal law. But amending the constitution just to ban gay marriage? That's just absurd! The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that's not a broad enough cause to warrant it. It's just not important enough to change the constitution over. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so like many others, the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a grey area for me. While I have several gay friends, I personally don't align with that lifestyle, but I do believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be an issue at the national level; rather, it should be left up to each state to decide. States are diverse in their political leanings, with many being democratic or republican. Democratic states are likely to favor gay marriage, while republican states might not. Living in a state, you should respect its stance on the matter since you've chosen to reside there. I believe homosexuals should have equal opportunities as heterosexuals, and based on that, I think each state should make the decision to legalize it. I don't agree with President Bush imposing his views on the entire country on this matter. He shouldn't be able to dictate how each state should run itself, as he won't be around forever. If a Democratic president reverses the ban on gay marriage, it would just be a game of political ping-pong. It's best to leave it up to each state to decide, as they'll be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Let me put it this way, there's no doubt that Myspace is a public forum. If you look up the definition, you'll see that it's designed for public viewing. So, when you post something on the internet, you should be aware that it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. And if they're doing it to keep students safe, I see no problem with that. After all, isn't the safety of students a responsibility of the school system? But, if they're just going on the internet to catch students in trouble, I'd say that's an invasion of privacy. However, if they're using it to make the school safer, like preventing a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. I mean, if it saves lives, isn't that what's important? But, if they're using it just to catch students, that's a step too far. It's like when you're in college, you're already worried about what you say in emails. You don't want anything coming back to haunt you later. And once it's on the internet, it's there forever. You can't take it back. So, if they're using it to make the school safer, that's one thing. But if they're just using it to catch students, that's a different story. That's not an invasion of privacy if it's to keep the students safe.",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was quite supportive of the war because I was personally affected by 9/11. I was all for going over there and causing as much chaos as they did here. However, as time passed, I realized that we may have overlooked a lot of key factors and didn't thoughtfully consider the long-term implications. We seemed to have rushed into it without a proper plan, and I believe it ultimately backfired. I don't know if I'm being fair, but I was all for it initially. Now, I'm very much against it, as I feel it hasn't achieved anything significant. I think the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than us. They can't even manage their own lives, so I don't see how we can impose our will on them. I almost don't care about what happens over there now. It's like, they fight among themselves, and that's that. We definitely went over there unprepared, not knowing what to expect. War is different for them; they're more brutal, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country. They just want us out. I think it would be best for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were more driven by emotion and anger than rational thought. I think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people demanded it, and he felt he had to act. At the time, I understood where he was coming from; they can't just do something like that and expect us to just let it slide. We had to respond, but I believe we could have handled it more strategically. We didn't have a clear plan for what to do once we got there. I don't think we really united behind a common goal, and that might have helped us more. Honestly, I don't think we're the right ones to change them. They'll always be the same. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made some, but not enough to justify staying there. No matter how long we stay, it's just going to collapse once we leave. And we can't stay there forever. I think we're hurting ourselves by staying there. No, let's just leave."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that in several ways, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. They have been discussing how their following is declining, and I believe it's because they are often quite rigid in their views on various topics. For instance, they're strongly opposed to gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can make it difficult for those with differing opinions to feel welcomed. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, I think they could maintain a strong base of followers. I've also heard that more people are turning against the Church due to their stance on these issues, and it's causing a bit of a division. While the Church is against abortion, if someone is for it, they might not want to be part of a community that sees it as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they might not want to follow a Church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see a reason why priests couldn't be married or why women couldn't be priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the declining following. After all, the Church did something that might not have been affected by these changes. If priests were allowed to marry, would they have done things differently? It's hard to say. However, I don't see why priests can't have both their religious devotion and their family life, just like everyone else.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that whether someone is gay or not is not a conscious choice they make. So I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's not right to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice like they don't have a say in how they are born. I mean, I was born straight, and I didn't choose that either. It doesn't seem like they can be held accountable for something they can't change. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It's not about national security or anything like that. They shouldn't interfere in people's lives because being gay is just how they were born. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Here are some reasons why:\n\nMany people argue that allowing same-sex couples to marry would pose a threat to traditional families, but I think it’s a misconception. The dynamics of a relationship are so varied and complex that comparing it to something as simple as a coin isn’t quite accurate. Heterosexual and homosexual couples have the same basic elements that contribute to a successful and satisfying relationship, like love, commitment, and shared values.\n\nMoreover, many civil rights protections are tied to marriage, such as property rights and healthcare benefits. For instance, a partner in a same-sex relationship might not be allowed to visit their spouse in the hospital, and they might not be able to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This can be unfair if you’re spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It’s a relationship, plain and simple. Many people seem to get hung up on the idea that homosexuals are asking for the right to get married in a church, but what they’re really asking for is a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement from the church, I don’t see why there should be an issue.\n\nLegalizing gay marriage is similar to the segregation but separate issue. It’s unfair and unequal. Just like heterosexual couples, homosexual couples can take on different roles in the relationship, and they have the same potential for community involvement. The concern about children of gay couples is a valid one, but it’s too early to say how they’ll be affected. The main concern is how children get treated by their peers and by society, which is often a reflection of societal attitudes.\n\nThe federal government should be actively involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. I think an amendment should be crafted that supports, rather than opposes, this right. However, I’m not sure about the political aspects, as I don’t follow politics closely. Most of the reasons I’ve heard, including from President Bush, are based on moral grounds. Morality is highly subjective and varies from person to person, so it’s unethical to create laws that enforce one group’s morality on the entire country.\n\nIt’s also important to note that many people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma or a personality defect. This is not backed by psychological research. Institutions that have studied these issues, like the American Psychological Association, have shown that this misconception is false. If more people listened to these institutions and less to popular opinion, societal attitudes might change.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that legalizing gay marriage is the right thing to do. It’s about love and commitment, and it should be treated with the same respect and dignity as any other relationship.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. Take oxycodone, for instance—it's a controlled substance, but we use it all the time because it's beneficial. Similarly, I'm not saying I'd put marijuana out there for the public to use freely, but I think it can have medicinal benefits when used responsibly.\n\nYou know, there are so many illegal drugs that pharmacies use every day. Vicodin, Percocet—those are known to be addictive, but they're used because they're beneficial. Denying that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should embrace the beneficial properties of marijuana, but it's got to be done responsibly.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as bad as the taboo around it suggests. It's not like heroin or cocaine. I'd say we should gradually integrate it into society, removing the stigma first. Then, perhaps people could use it responsibly. It's a tough call, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the 21st century. It's no longer as rigid as it once was. As a child, I would attend church every Sunday, dressed in matching outfits with my friends from our private school. Nowadays, the church has introduced youth services, which are much shorter, and people are more casual, even arriving in beachwear during the summer. The morning masses have also relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. While I'm unsure of the church's political stance, this is the most significant change I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I think these issues could not have been prevented by changes like allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, not just the environment. Even if priests were allowed to marry, their predispositions wouldn't change. If a man is genetically inclined to be a pedophile, he would likely still act on it, regardless of his marital status. I believe the church could have done more to address these issues if they were aware and covering them up, but I suspect not all cases were known.",
            "(Laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the initial premise, but I think that everyone was still very much in shock from the September 11th attacks. And I believe that we invaded Iraq under a false pretext, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to the attacks. But all of this has since been proven false, and it really rubs me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies.\n\nColin Powell, for instance, has said that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. Paul O’Neill, the Secretary of the Treasury who was seemingly forced out of his office, mentioned this in his book. It seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and he wanted to expand our energy supply in the long term.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough, but I'm not sure if pulling out now would be a good idea. The country could lapse into civil war and result in even more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations from surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia, doesn't seem ideal either, as it could lead to more problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and the Parliament isn't very effective. The political process is also experiencing a lot of friction due to radical elements vying for control.\n\nI can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I've done it. Just talking into it, right? Okay, cool. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Alright, I'm sorry. How about the War in Iraq? Well, let me think. Umm, at this point, I feel it's kind of pointless. It's not even a declared war, really. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq because we figured they were behind the terrorist attacks on 9/11. I mean, I'm not into this whole War on Iraq thing, so I don't keep up with the details. But as of now, we're over there trying to build democracy and, of course, get their oil. But it's not a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, they'll be upset because we'll have messed everything up. They'll have to start over, and it'll take forever for them to build a democracy. It's hard, man. I don't know. It's like we're trying to make them into another United States, but it's not their culture. It's just gonna make things worse for them. I mean, it's hard to say I want them out of there, but if we stay, it's gonna hurt us in the end. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, except this time, it's Bush who'll have to deal with being the president who started a meaningless war. It's hard to say I want it to end because so many families have sons and daughters over there, and we've destroyed their lives. But it's also hard to say I want them to stay because of the culture clash. I don't know, man. It's gonna go on for years, it seems. That's about it.",
            "I don't think it's right to legalize it, and I don't believe a state should even declare it legal. I feel this is really up to the churches, as the constitution states separation of church and state. It's explicitly clear, and I don't think trying to impose any power over it would be right, as it goes against what's already in the constitution. In my opinion, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone.\n\nI think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, and don't support it, except for in Boston and some areas like that. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and can't make illegal or legal. Separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about it would be right or even contradictory to what's already been said and written. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment is likely driven by personal religious beliefs, as the person pushing it is a Catholic. Their push for the amendment is just showing a preference for their religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. There isn't any substantial reason backing it up, other than personal views. I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or society in any significant way, and in fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "The war in Iraq is a topic that has sparked much debate over the years. Let me start by saying I believe that the government was not fully truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. I think the invasion was seen as a way to connect Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, the two events had little to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the September 11th attacks, to gain support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I believe that the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government failed to learn from past mistakes and was not prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the chaos that would ensue. The United States was removing the Iraqi government and trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what was attempted in Vietnam. However, the government did not anticipate the insurgency that would arise, as fighting citizens rather than a well-defined army is much more challenging.\n\nFirstly, I don't think we should have gotten into the war in the first place. But if we were to engage in war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. I believe the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They did not anticipate the void of power and the chaos that would occur after removing the Iraqi government. Despite being there for several years, the United States is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I think the government made it seem like it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough decision to make because we've been there for so long. Once we've committed to a war, it's hard to abandon the people we've removed the government from. We took away their way of life, so how can we abandon them? It's a difficult choice between trying to finish the job and considering the risk we're taking for a free democratic Iraq. The question of why Iraq was invaded while other countries with known weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, were not, raises the issue of the oil industry. It's a complex issue with a lot of money and resource control at play.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and that there will be peace in Iraq. But I'm not optimistic that this will happen anytime soon.",
            "Let's see, I've always been in support of gay marriage. I believe it's a personal preference, and science has shown that it's often biological rather than sociological, making it unfair to deny rights based on something that's largely out of people's control. It's also cruel and inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or the government should play a role, as it's a personal and household issue, not something to be decided at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage in his own way is ridiculous. Maybe it's because marriage is something two people can choose to do privately without much fuss, but if two gay people want to do it, it becomes a public spectacle. I think it should be a private, personal matter, not something the public or government gets involved in.\n\nNo, there's no turning back.",
            "You know, when you share something online, it's basically a public forum. Everything you put out there is visible to everyone. It can shape people's opinions about you, especially if it's something serious, like talking about violence or harmful activities. The internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, their bulletins will show up on your page. Someone at school might see something concerning and report it, as they can't afford to ignore potential threats. However, some people might just be fooling around, making it hard to discern what's serious. In our school, someone overheard a concerning statement and reported it to the authorities. They found that the person had made some worrying posts on Facebook that could have been taken seriously. So, if you don't want something to be public, don't put it online. If you don't want people to find it or form certain opinions, you can't control that. If you're an R.A. and you're friends with your residents on social media, you might see posts that you don't want to see, like pictures of them drinking or engaging in other activities. While I don't think school officials should friend students, if something is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously. They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if they receive a report about a potential threat, they have to act accordingly.",
            "I feel like the war has been stretched out too long. Initially, the purpose was noble—to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. But I believe we've lost sight of that aim and now we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. Perhaps there were even personal motivations tied to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original intention was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be justifiable. However, I think our reasons have become muddled and our purpose has been lost over time, as we seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting. I believe it has dragged on long enough and should come to a conclusion soon. After all, there comes a point when the local government must take charge. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions on a foreign war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure. This money could be better spent on addressing our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and school improvements. War is not a long-term expense, and there are more pressing issues to address. The ongoing war is a drain on our resources that could be more effectively used to solve our own problems.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? Someone found that post online and took action to prevent it because of what they saw. I don't think it was an invasion of privacy at all. On sites like Myspace, if you post information publicly, it's fair game for anyone to see, as long as you're okay with it. Maybe the person who saw the post was doing their job, or maybe they were just curious. Either way, I'm glad they intervened and prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt's a tough situation, though. You can't have one person monitoring everyone's profiles all day, but it's not fair to target only certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me knowing that strangers can see personal information about me. I've seen things on TV where people can find out so much about others just by looking at their profiles.\n\nI've had people IM me and know who I am without me knowing their screen name. It's disconcerting to think that someone knows my interests, where I am during the day, and who my friends are. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to communicate with friends. It's a tricky situation, and I only accept people I know as friends.\n\nMy roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace, which I thought was strange.

            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean I hate to say you know\nI hate to join the band wagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning\nUm\nI was but like it’s not really important anymore\nCause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean you just have to look at like the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nThey’ve done Iraqi polls\nThey’ve done global polls\nAnd I mean no like\nAbout seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations\nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not\nBut, I mean you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quick sand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\n I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I must admit, I feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not confined to women but affects various fields and roles, often based on societal expectations and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, in the workplace, women continue to face challenges in breaking through the \"glass ceiling.\" Even when they possess all the necessary qualifications, some boards may hesitate to promote them to top positions simply because historically women have not held such roles in the business world.\n\nMoreover, men also experience discrimination, particularly in fields like fashion or when they choose to stay at home as primary caregivers. Society often expects men to be the sole breadwinners, leading to judgment and disapproval when they deviate from this norm.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to their interest in a field traditionally dominated by women. This can lead to doubts about their understanding and experience with women's fashion.\n\nRegardless of the field, I believe gender discrimination persists due to societal setbacks in mindset and acceptance. While significant progress has been made, societal changes take time. Women are increasingly moving into leadership roles, and men are becoming more accepted as primary caregivers, but these shifts are gradual.\n\nTo effect change, we need to promote the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than being overly insistent. If we attempt to enforce change too quickly, people may resist. I believe we're already on the right path, with women rising to higher positions and men being more accepted in traditional female roles. However, we must continue to work at this pace to ensure sustained progress.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination can also occur based on factors like socioeconomic background and grammar. For example, someone from a farm with excellent intelligence but poor grammar might face judgments from others, underscoring the multifaceted nature of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, while significant strides have been made, there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality across all areas of society.",
            "In my opinion, decriminalization is the new approach to marijuana laws, which changes it from a criminal offense to more of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people caught with marijuana are cited rather than arrested. However, the long-term consequences of a marijuana charge, such as the stigma in job interviews and other areas of life, still exist.\n\nThere's an argument that decriminalization could save money for communities that are financially struggling. The costs of arrests, trials, and legal representation can be significant. In places like Denver, where people generally hold more open-minded views, decriminalization is well-received, freeing up money for public education, social programs, and other community needs.\n\nWhile I understand the financial benefits, I also believe in being cautious about the public's perception of marijuana. Legalization could lead to it being sold and used openly, much like cigarettes, which could be awkward and problematic in many contexts. Additionally, the effects of marijuana can differ greatly from person to person, with some people being more adversely affected than others.\n\nI don't have a strong opinion one way or the other, but I think it's important to consider all the factors involved.",
            "I'd say yes, because\n- A lot of what they do is quite traditional, like they've maintained certain practices for long periods of time.\n- It's good to stay connected to tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change.\n- Many Catholics feel obligated to attend Church every week and are quite strict about how things are done.\n- Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't fully adhere to the doctrine.\n- They also aren't very accepting of other religions, as seen in the case of my parents' interfaith marriage.\n- My mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was also Episcopalian. Despite their love for each other, they weren't married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's religious background.\n- This isn't really a display of tolerance for other religions.\n- We've been taught to love others, which is a Catholic principle, but it's hypocritical to say one thing and then not act on it.\n- I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine dictates specific actions, but the actual practice often goes against these teachings.\n- I don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior.\n- Children are much more vulnerable than spouses, so I think child molestation would happen regardless of whether priests are married or not.\n- Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior.",
            "Um\nI haven’t really made up my mind on this matter yet\nSo\nI can’t say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we’re facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close between separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don’t know I think\nI think that the\nAll civil unions\nI don’t know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament like considered\nWell people wouldn’t get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you’re married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat’s what it is\nIt’s two people\nThey shouldn’t have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn’t look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn’t just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit complicated. I have many gay friends, but I don’t necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. For instance, many states are Democratic, and they tend to push for gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you should respect the state's decision on the matter. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage; he shouldn't be able to decide how every state runs itself. He won't be in office for much longer, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban, it would just be a back-and-forth battle. It should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision. I don't think it should be a matter for the presidency to decide.",
            "No way, no I don't at all. Let me see, I think it's like this: Myspace is public, and a bulletin board is a place where you post things for others to see. If you put something on the internet, you should expect that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. If they see something that could prevent a school shooting, they have every right to do so. It's all about keeping students safe. School officials should only use it to make the school safer, not just to catch students doing something wrong. It's okay if they do it to protect students, but they shouldn't just snoop around. It's a public space, and students should know that. They shouldn't post things they don't want others to see. If they do, they should expect consequences. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever. It's just like not wanting to say something bad about someone in an email because it could come back to haunt you. Same with posting on Myspace. If you do something in college, it could come back when you're older. It's all about being careful with what you post. If something could make the school safer, school officials should use it. They're just doing their job to keep students safe. It's like how we practiced lock downs in school in response to terrorist attacks. They're just ensuring the school is a safe space for students.",

studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that in several ways, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. They have been discussing how their following is declining, and I believe it's because they are often quite rigid in their views on various topics. For instance, they're strongly opposed to gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can make it difficult for those with differing opinions to feel welcomed. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, I think they could maintain a strong base of followers. I've also heard that more people are turning against the Church due to their stance on these issues, and it's causing a bit of a division. While the Church is against abortion, if someone is for it, they might not want to be part of a community that sees it as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they might not want to follow a Church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see a reason why priests couldn't be married or why women couldn't be priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the declining following. After all, the Church did something that might not have been affected by these changes. If priests were allowed to marry, would they have done things differently? It's hard to say. However, I don't see why priests can't have both their religious devotion and their family life, just like everyone else.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that whether someone is gay or not is not a conscious choice they make. So I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's not right to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice like they don't have a say in how they are born. I mean, I was born straight, and I didn't choose that either. It doesn't seem like they can be held accountable for something they can't change. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It's not about national security or anything like that. They shouldn't interfere in people's lives because being gay is just how they were born. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Here are some reasons why:\n\nMany people argue that allowing same-sex couples to marry would pose a threat to traditional families, but I think it’s a misconception. The dynamics of a relationship are so varied and complex that comparing it to something as simple as a coin isn’t quite accurate. Heterosexual and homosexual couples have the same basic elements that contribute to a successful and satisfying relationship, like love, commitment, and shared values.\n\nMoreover, many civil rights protections are tied to marriage, such as property rights and healthcare benefits. For instance, a partner in a same-sex relationship might not be allowed to visit their spouse in the hospital, and they might not be able to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This can be unfair if you’re spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It’s a relationship, plain and simple. Many people seem to get hung up on the idea that homosexuals are asking for the right to get married in a church, but what they’re really asking for is a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement from the church, I don’t see why there should be an issue.\n\nLegalizing gay marriage is similar to the segregation but separate issue. It’s unfair and unequal. Just like heterosexual couples, homosexual couples can take on different roles in the relationship, and they have the same potential for community involvement. The concern about children of gay couples is a valid one, but it’s too early to say how they’ll be affected. The main concern is how children get treated by their peers and by society, which is often a reflection of societal attitudes.\n\nThe federal government should be actively involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. I think an amendment should be crafted that supports, rather than opposes, this right. However, I’m not sure about the political aspects, as I don’t follow politics closely. Most of the reasons I’ve heard, including from President Bush, are based on moral grounds. Morality is highly subjective and varies from person to person, so it’s unethical to create laws that enforce one group’s morality on the entire country.\n\nIt’s also important to note that many people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma or a personality defect. This is not backed by psychological research. Institutions that have studied these issues, like the American Psychological Association, have shown that this misconception is false. If more people listened to these institutions and less to popular opinion, societal attitudes might change.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that legalizing gay marriage is the right thing to do. It’s about love and commitment, and it should be treated with the same respect and dignity as any other relationship.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. Take oxycodone, for instance—it's a controlled substance, but we use it all the time because it's beneficial. Similarly, I'm not saying I'd put marijuana out there for the public to use freely, but I think it can have medicinal benefits when used responsibly.\n\nYou know, there are so many illegal drugs that pharmacies use every day. Vicodin, Percocet—those are known to be addictive, but they're used because they're beneficial. Denying that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should embrace the beneficial properties of marijuana, but it's got to be done responsibly.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as bad as the taboo around it suggests. It's not like heroin or cocaine. I'd say we should gradually integrate it into society, removing the stigma first. Then, perhaps people could use it responsibly. It's a tough call, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the 21st century. It's no longer as rigid as it once was. As a child, I would attend church every Sunday, dressed in matching outfits with my friends from our private school. Nowadays, the church has introduced youth services, which are much shorter, and people are more casual, even arriving in beachwear during the summer. The morning masses have also relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. While I'm unsure of the church's political stance, this is the most significant change I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I think these issues could not have been prevented by changes like allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, not just the environment. Even if priests were allowed to marry, their predispositions wouldn't change. If a man is genetically inclined to be a pedophile, he would likely still act on it, regardless of his marital status. I believe the church could have done more to address these issues if they were aware and covering them up, but I suspect not all cases were known.",
            "(Laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the initial premise, but I think that everyone was still very much in shock from the September 11th attacks. And I believe that we invaded Iraq under a false pretext, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to the attacks. But all of this has since been proven false, and it really rubs me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies.\n\nColin Powell, for instance, has said that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. Paul O’Neill, the Secretary of the Treasury who was seemingly forced out of his office, mentioned this in his book. It seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and he wanted to expand our energy supply in the long term.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough, but I'm not sure if pulling out now would be a good idea. The country could lapse into civil war and result in even more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations from surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia, doesn't seem ideal either, as it could lead to more problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and the Parliament isn't very effective. The political process is also experiencing a lot of friction due to radical elements vying for control.\n\nI can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I've done it. Just talking into it, right? Okay, cool. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Alright, I'm sorry. How about the War in Iraq? Well, let me think. Umm, at this point, I feel it's kind of pointless. It's not even a declared war, really. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq because we figured they were behind the terrorist attacks on 9/11. I mean, I'm not into this whole War on Iraq thing, so I don't keep up with the details. But as of now, we're over there trying to build democracy and, of course, get their oil. But it's not a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, they'll be upset because we'll have messed everything up. They'll have to start over, and it'll take forever for them to build a democracy. It's hard, man. I don't know. It's like we're trying to make them into another United States, but it's not their culture. It's just gonna make things worse for them. I mean, it's hard to say I want them out of there, but if we stay, it's gonna hurt us in the end. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, except this time, it's Bush who'll have to deal with being the president who started a meaningless war. It's hard to say I want it to end because so many families have sons and daughters over there, and we've destroyed their lives. But it's also hard to say I want them to stay because of the culture clash. I don't know, man. It's gonna go on for years, it seems. That's about it.",
            "I don't think it's right to legalize it, and I don't believe a state should even declare it legal. I feel this is really up to the churches, as the constitution states separation of church and state. It's explicitly clear, and I don't think trying to impose any power over it would be right, as it goes against what's already in the constitution. In my opinion, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone.\n\nI think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, and don't support it, except for in Boston and some areas like that. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and can't make illegal or legal. Separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about it would be right or even contradictory to what's already been said and written. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment is likely driven by personal religious beliefs, as the person pushing it is a Catholic. Their push for the amendment is just showing a preference for their religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. There isn't any substantial reason backing it up, other than personal views. I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or society in any significant way, and in fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "The war in Iraq is a topic that has sparked much debate over the years. Let me start by saying I believe that the government was not fully truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. I think the invasion was seen as a way to connect Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, the two events had little to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the September 11th attacks, to gain support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I believe that the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government failed to learn from past mistakes and was not prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the chaos that would ensue. The United States was removing the Iraqi government and trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what was attempted in Vietnam. However, the government did not anticipate the insurgency that would arise, as fighting citizens rather than a well-defined army is much more challenging.\n\nFirstly, I don't think we should have gotten into the war in the first place. But if we were to engage in war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. I believe the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They did not anticipate the void of power and the chaos that would occur after removing the Iraqi government. Despite being there for several years, the United States is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I think the government made it seem like it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough decision to make because we've been there for so long. Once we've committed to a war, it's hard to abandon the people we've removed the government from. We took away their way of life, so how can we abandon them? It's a difficult choice between trying to finish the job and considering the risk we're taking for a free democratic Iraq. The question of why Iraq was invaded while other countries with known weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, were not, raises the issue of the oil industry. It's a complex issue with a lot of money and resource control at play.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and that there will be peace in Iraq. But I'm not optimistic that this will happen anytime soon.",
            "Let's see, I've always been in support of gay marriage. I believe it's a personal preference, and science has shown that it's often biological rather than sociological, making it unfair to deny rights based on something that's largely out of people's control. It's also cruel and inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or the government should play a role, as it's a personal and household issue, not something to be decided at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage in his own way is ridiculous. Maybe it's because marriage is something two people can choose to do privately without much fuss, but if two gay people want to do it, it becomes a public spectacle. I think it should be a private, personal matter, not something the public or government gets involved in.\n\nNo, there's no turning back.",
            "You know, when you share something online, it's basically a public forum. Everything you put out there is visible to everyone. It can shape people's opinions about you, especially if it's something serious, like talking about violence or harmful activities. The internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, their bulletins will show up on your page. Someone at school might see something concerning and report it, as they can't afford to ignore potential threats. However, some people might just be fooling around, making it hard to discern what's serious. In our school, someone overheard a concerning statement and reported it to the authorities. They found that the person had made some worrying posts on Facebook that could have been taken seriously. So, if you don't want something to be public, don't put it online. If you don't want people to find it or form certain opinions, you can't control that. If you're an R.A. and you're friends with your residents on social media, you might see posts that you don't want to see, like pictures of them drinking or engaging in other activities. While I don't think school officials should friend students, if something is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously. They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if they receive a report about a potential threat, they have to act accordingly.",
            "I feel like the war has been stretched out too long. Initially, the purpose was noble—to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. But I believe we've lost sight of that aim and now we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. Perhaps there were even personal motivations tied to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original intention was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be justifiable. However, I think our reasons have become muddled and our purpose has been lost over time, as we seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting. I believe it has dragged on long enough and should come to a conclusion soon. After all, there comes a point when the local government must take charge. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions on a foreign war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure. This money could be better spent on addressing our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and school improvements. War is not a long-term expense, and there are more pressing issues to address. The ongoing war is a drain on our resources that could be more effectively used to solve our own problems.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? Someone found that post online and took action to prevent it because of what they saw. I don't think it was an invasion of privacy at all. On sites like Myspace, if you post information publicly, it's fair game for anyone to see, as long as you're okay with it. Maybe the person who saw the post was doing their job, or maybe they were just curious. Either way, I'm glad they intervened and prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt's a tough situation, though. You can't have one person monitoring everyone's profiles all day, but it's not fair to target only certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me knowing that strangers can see personal information about me. I've seen things on TV where people can find out so much about others just by looking at their profiles.\n\nI've had people IM me and know who I am without me knowing their screen name. It's disconcerting to think that someone knows my interests, where I am during the day, and who my friends are. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to communicate with friends. It's a tricky situation, and I only accept people I know as friends.\n\nMy roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace, which I thought was strange.

            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean I hate to say you know\nI hate to join the band wagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning\nUm\nI was but like it’s not really important anymore\nCause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean you just have to look at like the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nThey’ve done Iraqi polls\nThey’ve done global polls\nAnd I mean no like\nAbout seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations\nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not\nBut, I mean you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quick sand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\n I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I must admit, I feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not confined to women but affects various fields and roles, often based on societal expectations and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, in the workplace, women continue to face challenges in breaking through the \"glass ceiling.\" Even when they possess all the necessary qualifications, some boards may hesitate to promote them to top positions simply because historically women have not held such roles in the business world.\n\nMoreover, men also experience discrimination, particularly in fields like fashion or when they choose to stay at home as primary caregivers. Society often expects men to be the sole breadwinners, leading to judgment and disapproval when they deviate from this norm.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to their interest in a field traditionally dominated by women. This can lead to doubts about their understanding and experience with women's fashion.\n\nRegardless of the field, I believe gender discrimination persists due to societal setbacks in mindset and acceptance. While significant progress has been made, societal changes take time. Women are increasingly moving into leadership roles, and men are becoming more accepted as primary caregivers, but these shifts are gradual.\n\nTo effect change, we need to promote the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than being overly insistent. If we attempt to enforce change too quickly, people may resist. I believe we're already on the right path, with women rising to higher positions and men being more accepted in traditional female roles. However, we must continue to work at this pace to ensure sustained progress.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination can also occur based on factors like socioeconomic background and grammar. For example, someone from a farm with excellent intelligence but poor grammar might face judgments from others, underscoring the multifaceted nature of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, while significant strides have been made, there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality across all areas of society.",
            "In my opinion, decriminalization is the new approach to marijuana laws, which changes it from a criminal offense to more of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people caught with marijuana are cited rather than arrested. However, the long-term consequences of a marijuana charge, such as the stigma in job interviews and other areas of life, still exist.\n\nThere's an argument that decriminalization could save money for communities that are financially struggling. The costs of arrests, trials, and legal representation can be significant. In places like Denver, where people generally hold more open-minded views, decriminalization is well-received, freeing up money for public education, social programs, and other community needs.\n\nWhile I understand the financial benefits, I also believe in being cautious about the public's perception of marijuana. Legalization could lead to it being sold and used openly, much like cigarettes, which could be awkward and problematic in many contexts. Additionally, the effects of marijuana can differ greatly from person to person, with some people being more adversely affected than others.\n\nI don't have a strong opinion one way or the other, but I think it's important to consider all the factors involved.",
            "I'd say yes, because\n- A lot of what they do is quite traditional, like they've maintained certain practices for long periods of time.\n- It's good to stay connected to tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change.\n- Many Catholics feel obligated to attend Church every week and are quite strict about how things are done.\n- Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't fully adhere to the doctrine.\n- They also aren't very accepting of other religions, as seen in the case of my parents' interfaith marriage.\n- My mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was also Episcopalian. Despite their love for each other, they weren't married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's religious background.\n- This isn't really a display of tolerance for other religions.\n- We've been taught to love others, which is a Catholic principle, but it's hypocritical to say one thing and then not act on it.\n- I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine dictates specific actions, but the actual practice often goes against these teachings.\n- I don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior.\n- Children are much more vulnerable than spouses, so I think child molestation would happen regardless of whether priests are married or not.\n- Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior.",
            "Um\nI haven’t really made up my mind on this matter yet\nSo\nI can’t say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we’re facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close between separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don’t know I think\nI think that the\nAll civil unions\nI don’t know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament like considered\nWell people wouldn’t get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you’re married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat’s what it is\nIt’s two people\nThey shouldn’t have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn’t look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn’t just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit complicated. I have many gay friends, but I don’t necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. For instance, many states are Democratic, and they tend to push for gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you should respect the state's decision on the matter. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage; he shouldn't be able to decide how every state runs itself. He won't be in office for much longer, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban, it would just be a back-and-forth battle. It should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision. I don't think it should be a matter for the presidency to decide.",
            "No way, no I don't at all. Let me see, I think it's like this: Myspace is public, and a bulletin board is a place where you post things for others to see. If you put something on the internet, you should expect that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. If they see something that could prevent a school shooting, they have every right to do so. It's all about keeping students safe. School officials should only use it to make the school safer, not just to catch students doing something wrong. It's okay if they do it to protect students, but they shouldn't just snoop around. It's a public space, and students should know that. They shouldn't post things they don't want others to see. If they do, they should expect consequences. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever. It's just like not wanting to say something bad about someone in an email because it could come back to haunt you. Same with posting on Myspace. If you do something in college, it could come back when you're older. It's all about being careful with what you post. If something could make the school safer, school officials should use it. They're just doing their job to keep students safe. It's like how we practiced lock downs in school in response to terrorist attacks. They're just ensuring the school is a safe space for students.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that in several ways, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. They have been discussing how their following is declining, and I believe it's because they are often quite rigid in their views on various topics. For instance, they're strongly opposed to gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which can make it difficult for those with differing opinions to feel welcomed. If the Church were to adopt a more contemporary mindset, I think they could maintain a strong base of followers. I've also heard that more people are turning against the Church due to their stance on these issues, and it's causing a bit of a division. While the Church is against abortion, if someone is for it, they might not want to be part of a community that sees it as completely wrong. Similarly, if someone supports gay marriage, they might not want to follow a Church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see a reason why priests couldn't be married or why women couldn't be priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the declining following. After all, the Church did something that might not have been affected by these changes. If priests were allowed to marry, would they have done things differently? It's hard to say. However, I don't see why priests can't have both their religious devotion and their family life, just like everyone else.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that whether someone is gay or not is not a conscious choice they make. So I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's not right to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a choice like they don't have a say in how they are born. I mean, I was born straight, and I didn't choose that either. It doesn't seem like they can be held accountable for something they can't change. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It's not about national security or anything like that. They shouldn't interfere in people's lives because being gay is just how they were born. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized. Here are some reasons why:\n\nMany people argue that allowing same-sex couples to marry would pose a threat to traditional families, but I think it’s a misconception. The dynamics of a relationship are so varied and complex that comparing it to something as simple as a coin isn’t quite accurate. Heterosexual and homosexual couples have the same basic elements that contribute to a successful and satisfying relationship, like love, commitment, and shared values.\n\nMoreover, many civil rights protections are tied to marriage, such as property rights and healthcare benefits. For instance, a partner in a same-sex relationship might not be allowed to visit their spouse in the hospital, and they might not be able to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This can be unfair if you’re spending the rest of your life with someone.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples are just as successful as heterosexual couples, with similar factors contributing to relationship satisfaction. It’s a relationship, plain and simple. Many people seem to get hung up on the idea that homosexuals are asking for the right to get married in a church, but what they’re really asking for is a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no involvement from the church, I don’t see why there should be an issue.\n\nLegalizing gay marriage is similar to the segregation but separate issue. It’s unfair and unequal. Just like heterosexual couples, homosexual couples can take on different roles in the relationship, and they have the same potential for community involvement. The concern about children of gay couples is a valid one, but it’s too early to say how they’ll be affected. The main concern is how children get treated by their peers and by society, which is often a reflection of societal attitudes.\n\nThe federal government should be actively involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. I think an amendment should be crafted that supports, rather than opposes, this right. However, I’m not sure about the political aspects, as I don’t follow politics closely. Most of the reasons I’ve heard, including from President Bush, are based on moral grounds. Morality is highly subjective and varies from person to person, so it’s unethical to create laws that enforce one group’s morality on the entire country.\n\nIt’s also important to note that many people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma or a personality defect. This is not backed by psychological research. Institutions that have studied these issues, like the American Psychological Association, have shown that this misconception is false. If more people listened to these institutions and less to popular opinion, societal attitudes might change.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that legalizing gay marriage is the right thing to do. It’s about love and commitment, and it should be treated with the same respect and dignity as any other relationship.",
            "Well first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it lacks beneficial properties. Take oxycodone, for instance—it's a controlled substance, but we use it all the time because it's beneficial. Similarly, I'm not saying I'd put marijuana out there for the public to use freely, but I think it can have medicinal benefits when used responsibly.\n\nYou know, there are so many illegal drugs that pharmacies use every day. Vicodin, Percocet—those are known to be addictive, but they're used because they're beneficial. Denying that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should embrace the beneficial properties of marijuana, but it's got to be done responsibly.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as bad as the taboo around it suggests. It's not like heroin or cocaine. I'd say we should gradually integrate it into society, removing the stigma first. Then, perhaps people could use it responsibly. It's a tough call, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "I believe the church has evolved to adapt to the 21st century. It's no longer as rigid as it once was. As a child, I would attend church every Sunday, dressed in matching outfits with my friends from our private school. Nowadays, the church has introduced youth services, which are much shorter, and people are more casual, even arriving in beachwear during the summer. The morning masses have also relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. While I'm unsure of the church's political stance, this is the most significant change I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I think these issues could not have been prevented by changes like allowing female priests or married priests. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, not just the environment. Even if priests were allowed to marry, their predispositions wouldn't change. If a man is genetically inclined to be a pedophile, he would likely still act on it, regardless of his marital status. I believe the church could have done more to address these issues if they were aware and covering them up, but I suspect not all cases were known.",
            "(Laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the initial premise, but I think that everyone was still very much in shock from the September 11th attacks. And I believe that we invaded Iraq under a false pretext, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to the attacks. But all of this has since been proven false, and it really rubs me the wrong way. It just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies.\n\nColin Powell, for instance, has said that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since September 11th. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war. Paul O’Neill, the Secretary of the Treasury who was seemingly forced out of his office, mentioned this in his book. It seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and he wanted to expand our energy supply in the long term.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough, but I'm not sure if pulling out now would be a good idea. The country could lapse into civil war and result in even more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations from surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia, doesn't seem ideal either, as it could lead to more problems with Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems to be dissolving, and the Parliament isn't very effective. The political process is also experiencing a lot of friction due to radical elements vying for control.\n\nI can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I've done it. Just talking into it, right? Okay, cool. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Alright, I'm sorry. How about the War in Iraq? Well, let me think. Umm, at this point, I feel it's kind of pointless. It's not even a declared war, really. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq because we figured they were behind the terrorist attacks on 9/11. I mean, I'm not into this whole War on Iraq thing, so I don't keep up with the details. But as of now, we're over there trying to build democracy and, of course, get their oil. But it's not a good enough reason to stay. If we leave, they'll be upset because we'll have messed everything up. They'll have to start over, and it'll take forever for them to build a democracy. It's hard, man. I don't know. It's like we're trying to make them into another United States, but it's not their culture. It's just gonna make things worse for them. I mean, it's hard to say I want them out of there, but if we stay, it's gonna hurt us in the end. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, except this time, it's Bush who'll have to deal with being the president who started a meaningless war. It's hard to say I want it to end because so many families have sons and daughters over there, and we've destroyed their lives. But it's also hard to say I want them to stay because of the culture clash. I don't know, man. It's gonna go on for years, it seems. That's about it.",
            "I don't think it's right to legalize it, and I don't believe a state should even declare it legal. I feel this is really up to the churches, as the constitution states separation of church and state. It's explicitly clear, and I don't think trying to impose any power over it would be right, as it goes against what's already in the constitution. In my opinion, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be in defiance of what has already been said and written in stone.\n\nI think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, and don't support it, except for in Boston and some areas like that. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and can't make illegal or legal. Separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about it would be right or even contradictory to what's already been said and written. It would be one of the few amendments that would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment is likely driven by personal religious beliefs, as the person pushing it is a Catholic. Their push for the amendment is just showing a preference for their religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. There isn't any substantial reason backing it up, other than personal views. I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or society in any significant way, and in fact, it might have a positive impact on society.",
            "The war in Iraq is a topic that has sparked much debate over the years. Let me start by saying I believe that the government was not fully truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. I think the invasion was seen as a way to connect Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, the two events had little to do with each other. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the September 11th attacks, to gain support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI personally am against war, especially preemptive strikes. I believe that the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government failed to learn from past mistakes and was not prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government and the chaos that would ensue. The United States was removing the Iraqi government and trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what was attempted in Vietnam. However, the government did not anticipate the insurgency that would arise, as fighting citizens rather than a well-defined army is much more challenging.\n\nFirstly, I don't think we should have gotten into the war in the first place. But if we were to engage in war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. I believe the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They did not anticipate the void of power and the chaos that would occur after removing the Iraqi government. Despite being there for several years, the United States is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I think the government made it seem like it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a tough decision to make because we've been there for so long. Once we've committed to a war, it's hard to abandon the people we've removed the government from. We took away their way of life, so how can we abandon them? It's a difficult choice between trying to finish the job and considering the risk we're taking for a free democratic Iraq. The question of why Iraq was invaded while other countries with known weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, were not, raises the issue of the oil industry. It's a complex issue with a lot of money and resource control at play.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and that there will be peace in Iraq. But I'm not optimistic that this will happen anytime soon.",
            "Let's see, I've always been in support of gay marriage. I believe it's a personal preference, and science has shown that it's often biological rather than sociological, making it unfair to deny rights based on something that's largely out of people's control. It's also cruel and inhumane. I've been an advocate for it for a long time. I don't think politics or the government should play a role, as it's a personal and household issue, not something to be decided at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. Bush's attempt to interpret marriage in his own way is ridiculous. Maybe it's because marriage is something two people can choose to do privately without much fuss, but if two gay people want to do it, it becomes a public spectacle. I think it should be a private, personal matter, not something the public or government gets involved in.\n\nNo, there's no turning back.",
            "You know, when you share something online, it's basically a public forum. Everything you put out there is visible to everyone. It can shape people's opinions about you, especially if it's something serious, like talking about violence or harmful activities. The internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace, their bulletins will show up on your page. Someone at school might see something concerning and report it, as they can't afford to ignore potential threats. However, some people might just be fooling around, making it hard to discern what's serious. In our school, someone overheard a concerning statement and reported it to the authorities. They found that the person had made some worrying posts on Facebook that could have been taken seriously. So, if you don't want something to be public, don't put it online. If you don't want people to find it or form certain opinions, you can't control that. If you're an R.A. and you're friends with your residents on social media, you might see posts that you don't want to see, like pictures of them drinking or engaging in other activities. While I don't think school officials should friend students, if something is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously. They shouldn't be monitoring phone conversations or texts, but if they receive a report about a potential threat, they have to act accordingly.",
            "I feel like the war has been stretched out too long. Initially, the purpose was noble—to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. But I believe we've lost sight of that aim and now we're just fighting to prove our global dominance. Perhaps there were even personal motivations tied to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If the original intention was to bring democracy to a tyrannical regime, that would be justifiable. However, I think our reasons have become muddled and our purpose has been lost over time, as we seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting. I believe it has dragged on long enough and should come to a conclusion soon. After all, there comes a point when the local government must take charge. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions on a foreign war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure. This money could be better spent on addressing our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and school improvements. War is not a long-term expense, and there are more pressing issues to address. The ongoing war is a drain on our resources that could be more effectively used to solve our own problems.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? Someone found that post online and took action to prevent it because of what they saw. I don't think it was an invasion of privacy at all. On sites like Myspace, if you post information publicly, it's fair game for anyone to see, as long as you're okay with it. Maybe the person who saw the post was doing their job, or maybe they were just curious. Either way, I'm glad they intervened and prevented a life from being lost.\n\nIt's a tough situation, though. You can't have one person monitoring everyone's profiles all day, but it's not fair to target only certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me knowing that strangers can see personal information about me. I've seen things on TV where people can find out so much about others just by looking at their profiles.\n\nI've had people IM me and know who I am without me knowing their screen name. It's disconcerting to think that someone knows my interests, where I am during the day, and who my friends are. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, I want to communicate with friends. It's a tricky situation, and I only accept people I know as friends.\n\nMy roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace, which I thought was strange. I'm not sure how they had the right to do that.",

            "I must admit, I feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not confined to women but affects various fields and roles, often based on societal expectations and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, in the workplace, women continue to face challenges in breaking through the \"glass ceiling.\" Even when they possess all the necessary qualifications, some boards may hesitate to promote them to top positions simply because historically women have not held such roles in the business world.\n\nMoreover, men also experience discrimination, particularly in fields like fashion or when they choose to stay at home as primary caregivers. Society often expects men to be the sole breadwinners, leading to judgment and disapproval when they deviate from this norm.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to their interest in a field traditionally dominated by women. This can lead to doubts about their understanding and experience with women's fashion.\n\nRegardless of the field, I believe gender discrimination persists due to societal setbacks in mindset and acceptance. While significant progress has been made, societal changes take time. Women are increasingly moving into leadership roles, and men are becoming more accepted as primary caregivers, but these shifts are gradual.\n\nTo effect change, we need to promote the positive qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than being overly insistent. If we attempt to enforce change too quickly, people may resist. I believe we're already on the right path, with women rising to higher positions and men being more accepted in traditional female roles. However, we must continue to work at this pace to ensure sustained progress.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination can also occur based on factors like socioeconomic background and grammar. For example, someone from a farm with excellent intelligence but poor grammar might face judgments from others, underscoring the multifaceted nature of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, while significant strides have been made, there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality across all areas of society.",
            "In my opinion, decriminalization is the new approach to marijuana laws, which changes it from a criminal offense to more of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people caught with marijuana are cited rather than arrested. However, the long-term consequences of a marijuana charge, such as the stigma in job interviews and other areas of life, still exist.\n\nThere's an argument that decriminalization could save money for communities that are financially struggling. The costs of arrests, trials, and legal representation can be significant. In places like Denver, where people generally hold more open-minded views, decriminalization is well-received, freeing up money for public education, social programs, and other community needs.\n\nWhile I understand the financial benefits, I also believe in being cautious about the public's perception of marijuana. Legalization could lead to it being sold and used openly, much like cigarettes, which could be awkward and problematic in many contexts. Additionally, the effects of marijuana can differ greatly from person to person, with some people being more adversely affected than others.\n\nI don't have a strong opinion one way or the other, but I think it's important to consider all the factors involved.",
            "I'd say yes, because\n- A lot of what they do is quite traditional, like they've maintained certain practices for long periods of time.\n- It's good to stay connected to tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change.\n- Many Catholics feel obligated to attend Church every week and are quite strict about how things are done.\n- Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't fully adhere to the doctrine.\n- They also aren't very accepting of other religions, as seen in the case of my parents' interfaith marriage.\n- My mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was also Episcopalian. Despite their love for each other, they weren't married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's religious background.\n- This isn't really a display of tolerance for other religions.\n- We've been taught to love others, which is a Catholic principle, but it's hypocritical to say one thing and then not act on it.\n- I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine dictates specific actions, but the actual practice often goes against these teachings.\n- I don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior.\n- Children are much more vulnerable than spouses, so I think child molestation would happen regardless of whether priests are married or not.\n- Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve the problem of pedophilic behavior.",
            "Um\nI haven’t really made up my mind on this matter yet\nSo\nI can’t say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we’re facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close between separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don’t know I think\nI think that the\nAll civil unions\nI don’t know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament like considered\nWell people wouldn’t get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you’re married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat’s what it is\nIt’s two people\nThey shouldn’t have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn’t look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn’t just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my stance on homosexuality is a bit complicated. I have many gay friends, but I don’t necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state decides on its own. For instance, many states are Democratic, and they tend to push for gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you should respect the state's decision on the matter. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don't agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage; he shouldn't be able to decide how every state runs itself. He won't be in office for much longer, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban, it would just be a back-and-forth battle. It should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision. I don't think it should be a matter for the presidency to decide.",
            "No way, no I don't at all. Let me see, I think it's like this: Myspace is public, and a bulletin board is a place where you post things for others to see. If you put something on the internet, you should expect that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. If they see something that could prevent a school shooting, they have every right to do so. It's all about keeping students safe. School officials should only use it to make the school safer, not just to catch students doing something wrong. It's okay if they do it to protect students, but they shouldn't just snoop around. It's a public space, and students should know that. They shouldn't post things they don't want others to see. If they do, they should expect consequences. Once it's on the internet, it's there forever. It's just like not wanting to say something bad about someone in an email because it could come back to haunt you. Same with posting on Myspace. If you do something in college, it could come back when you're older. It's all about being careful with what you post. If something could make the school safer, school officials should use it. They're just doing their job to keep students safe. It's like how we practiced lock downs in school in response to terrorist attacks. They're just ensuring the school is a safe space for students.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes in their views. The Church has been facing a decline in followers because it often isn't very accepting of many societal changes. For example, the Church's stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as old-fashioned and not in line with modern beliefs. If the Church were to adapt to a more contemporary perspective on these issues, it might not struggle as much with maintaining its follower base. People are starting to turn away from the Church because they don't agree with its views on these subjects. For instance, someone who supports abortion or gay marriage might not find it comfortable to follow a religion that views these practices as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past incidents. The Church's teachings are so ingrained that I'm not certain how allowing priests to marry or have female priests would have altered their actions. I don't see why priests can't also have a family life alongside their religious duties, as many other professionals in the world do. So, while I don’t think these changes would necessarily prevent past incidents, I do believe they would make the Church more open and relatable to a broader audience.",
            "Um, I'm not opposed to gay marriage, to be honest. I think that people are born that way, regardless of what they choose. It's not like they can consciously make that decision. So, I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I mean, it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about this topic much, but I would definitely say it's wrong. It seems like it's not a choice, and they don't have a choice on how they are. Like, I was born straight, and someone else was born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved. It's not really a legal or moral issue. I mean, it's just who they are. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I strongly believe that the legalization of gay marriage is a no-brainer. There isn't a compelling reason against it, even though many people argue that it poses a threat to traditional families. It's important to note that there are many different aspects to families, and homosexual couples are no different. They too have the same relationships, roles, and concerns as heterosexual couples. The same civil rights apply to them, such as property taxes and healthcare, where their partners cannot visit them in the hospital or be considered next of kin. This is a flawed practice if you're spending the rest of your life with someone. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples, making it the same kind of relationship. The only difference is the legal recognition, which is what they're asking for, not a religious ceremony. The federal government should make it legal in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. While I understand that President Bush has strong views on this issue, it's crucial to consider the government's role in promoting equality and not enforcing religious standards on the entire population. It's hypocritical to have the government enforce religious standards while opposing simple amendments like 'under God' in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage due to the misconception that gay people are psychologically damaged, which is not backed by research. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth. It's crucial to base our beliefs on evidence rather than popular opinion or personal biases.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and let me tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. I mean, there are plenty of illegal substances that we use in the pharmacy for legitimate medicinal purposes. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's a controlled substance, but we use it because it has benefits that outweigh its potential risks. So, I'd argue that marijuana could be considered in a similar light. If we can embrace its beneficial properties and use it responsibly, why not? It's not like heroin or cocaine. It's just a tough substance to deal with, that's all.\n\nYou know, I'm not saying we should legalize it overnight. Maybe we should integrate it gradually, remove the stigma first and then see how it goes. But if we can get rid of that negative image around marijuana, people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly, for medical purposes, it has its place. But no, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol. At least not in the sense that it's a drug that's widely accepted and integrated into society. It's a tough one, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "Um, I believe the church has indeed evolved to accommodate the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be, especially for those who grew up attending Sunday services. I remember wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses as a child, and seeing my friends there on weekends. Now, however, the church has introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often rush in late, and some even arrive in their beach attire. Even at the morning masses where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. While I appreciate the change, the church still has a significant problem on its hands concerning the pedophilia accusations against Catholic priests. I don't believe these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests, as pedophilia is often rooted in genetics and not necessarily a result of marital status. Many religions, like Seventh Heaven, allow their leaders to marry, yet these issues still occur. Therefore, I think the church could have done little to prevent these cases if those involved were predisposed to their attraction towards young children. If they knew and tried to cover it up, that's another story, but I don't think all cases were that way. Besides, the church can't control someone's genetics or nature. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Um, initially, I was okay with the idea. However, given the lingering effects of the September 11th attacks, it seems we invaded Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration initially connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since been proven false, which really gets under my skin. The Iraq war just boils my blood, especially since it feels like the Bush administration lied to the American people, including Colin Powell at the UN. I think this is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I'm convinced the Bush administration had a total disregard for the constitution, marginalizing it since September 11th. It seems they came into office with the intention to go to war.\n\nI remember the Secretary of the Treasury who alleged this in his book after he was forced out, suggesting that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and wanted to expand our energy supply. This was a rather underhanded move, and while I believe it's gone on long enough, I think withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The interim government seems to be crumbling, as evidenced by the ineffective parliament and the rise of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr. This political friction could lead to a power struggle, making the situation even more complicated.\n\nUm, none of this is something I can articulate politely.",
            "I guess I don't really have a strong opinion on the War in Iraq. I mean, it's not like it's a declared war or anything, right? I think it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being behind them. I'm not much of a news junkie, so I don't keep up with the details, but I know we're there to try and build a democracy, which isn't easy, and to maybe get some oil. But I don't think it's a good reason to stay there. If we leave, they might be mad, and if we stay, we're just pouring resources into it. It's a tough situation, and I don't think it's fair to say it should end or not end. I know families with kids in Iraq, and it's hard to want them to come home, but I also worry about the cultural differences and how trying to change them could backfire. I think it's a messy situation that might go on for a long time.",
            "I admit, I’m not feeling it. I believe it’s not right to make it legal, or for a state to even declare it as such. I think it’s something the churches should decide, given that the constitution's separation of church and state is clear and well-defined. Trying to enforce power over it would be defying what’s already been established. I don’t think it’s right for the government to choose one church’s belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don’t feel it’s up to the government to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of our constitution, and any amendment would be contradictory, probably one of the few amendments that restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment seems to be based on personal beliefs rather than logical reasoning. I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society. I think it could have a positive impact on society, but I’m not sure how. I’ve pretty much covered it all.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo get started, I believe the government didn't fully disclose the reasons for going to war with Iraq to the American people. Firstly, they tried to connect the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which was largely unfounded. The government exploited the public's anger and outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003.\nI myself am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, particularly the high cost in American lives. Removing a country's government is one thing, but preparing for the aftermath is quite another.\nThe government didn't seem ready for the void of power and the chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government. They were trying to implement a democratic government, similar to their attempt to remove communists and establish democracy in Vietnam. However, this process is complex and time-consuming.\nI believe the government wasn't adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They made it seem like a short, successful stay, which was naïve. We shouldn't have believed that establishing a democratic government would be easy. It took years to achieve in our own country, and there were plenty of struggles along the way.\nIn the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for potentially voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, once we're in a war for so long, how can we abandon the people we've disrupted? We removed their government and way of life, so how can we leave them now?\nThere's also the matter of American casualties. How much risk is too much for a free democratic Iraq? The whole reason for invading Iraq was supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? The main reason is likely oil, given that Iraq is a significant source of our oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\nBefore going to war, there was a claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Other countries like North Korea, which have such weapons, aren't being targeted for the same reasons. I don't think the government is being thorough or honest in their decision-making.\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq, but it might be a long way off.",
            "So, let me start by saying that I've always been for gay marriage, and I still am. I really believe it's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. I think it's inhumane to take away rights from people based on something they can't control. I've been an advocate for gay marriage for a long time.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a role in this. It's a personal, household-level decision, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, I have a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, and I see no difference between them and anyone else. Bush's interpretation of marriage is ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that homosexuality might be a predisposition, something you're born with, not something you choose. It's not about growing up in a specific environment, like having four sisters and no father. So, I think it's biological, not sociological.\n\nOther than the obvious, I think marriage should be a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do so without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it's splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something in the public eye or national domain.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "It's important to remember that the internet is a public forum. Whatever you post is accessible to everyone. As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.

The internet is seen by everyone, including your friends on Myspace, who will receive the bulletin. The school has to take it seriously and act upon it, regardless of whether it's just a joke or actually serious. They can't ignore it because something might happen and they could have prevented it. Similarly, if you're a student and someone hears something concerning and reports it, the school needs to investigate.

            "I believe the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in a country with an unfair political system. However, I think we've lost sight of this original purpose and now it feels like we're fighting just to assert our global power. There were also questionable motives, given George Bush's father's past feud with Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to provide a democratic government, that would be a fair cause. But over time, I sense the motivation has deteriorated, and it seems we're still at war just to have a decisive end. I think it's gone on long enough, and it's time to let their government handle itself. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which is a drain on our economy. There are pressing issues here at home, such as poverty and infrastructure, that we should be addressing. It's a shame to be spending so much money on war when there are so many needs at home. This war should not be part of our long-term budget. I firmly believe we should focus on our own issues and let the other country stand on its own.",
            "I have a question that needs clarification. Would it be an invasion of privacy if someone went online and found something concerning that someone else had posted on a site like Myspace? I mean, if you put information on the internet, it's essentially available for anyone to see, especially if you're on a platform where you need to have friends to view your profile. So, if I think that was a good thing, that someone saw something and was able to prevent a tragedy, it's tough because you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles. But then again, it might become discriminatory if they only target certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I'm a bit uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can access my profile. I saw on TV once where a man easily found someone's screen name and convinced them to meet him. It's unsettling when people can look at my schedule or photos and know a lot about me. I only accept people I know on my profile, but it's still a tricky issue. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to make such a rule.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two more things I want to mention about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about this\nI mean, I hate to say I was against it\nHate to join the crowd that says \"I was against it from the start\"\nUm\nI was, but it’s not really important anymore\nCause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea\nExcept within the administration\nUm\nThey don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, you know, you just have to look at the polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nIraqi polls\nGlobal polls\nUm\nAnd the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nSeventy percent of the U.S. troops think it was a dumb idea\nUm\nAnd pulling out is going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, it’s just the cultural clash between the U.S. and the Middle East\nIt’s a huge gap\nUm\nAnd for the administration to think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn’t exist\nIt’s just not going to happen\nUm\nAnd yeah, Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons\nBefore you invade a country\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, the administration might have some hopeful ideas\nBut I’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nUm\nI mean, if we want to do it gradually over a year or more\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t have a problem with that\nBut just leaving now seems like the best option\nUm\nAnd you know, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year\nAnd at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now\nUm\nAnd they’re the people we’re trying to help\nUm\nSo, if they say they want us to leave, we should listen\nUm\nAnd at least if we ask them, and they say yes, then it’s not on us if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd you know, if we decide to help out afterwards, we’ll at least be the good guys\nUm\nOr at least better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Yes, I indeed believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, not just with women, but across various fields and roles. For instance, in the workplace, women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they may not be considered for promotions or positions of power because of societal expectations and historical norms.\n\nSimilarly, men can also face discrimination, especially in fields like fashion or in the role of a stay-at-home parent. It's quite uncommon for men to be the primary caregiver in a family, and society often looks down upon this because of traditional gender roles. Additionally, in the fashion industry, men might not be taken seriously if they are interested in fashion, as it's typically viewed as a female-dominated field.\n\nThe challenges extend further into other industries and job roles. For example, people who grew up in certain environments or have accents might be discriminated against, even if they possess great intelligence. This is because societal perceptions and biases can cloud judgments about a person's competence.\n\nChanging these perceptions and biases is a slow process, as societal mindsets are deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress, with women increasingly taking on higher positions and men becoming more accepted in certain roles. However, change often comes gradually, and it's crucial to promote these changes without forcing them, allowing society to adapt naturally. Sometimes, simply showcasing the positive qualities and capabilities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help shift perceptions.",
            "Here's my understanding of the situation: The legal status of marijuana has changed. They've moved it from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket, which means getting caught with it just results in a citation rather than arrest. This is because it's costly for municipalities to arrest, book, and prosecute people, and it's also considered a waste of resources. Some places like Denver, which are more open to these types of policies, have legalized marijuana. This has freed up money for public education, social programs, and food programs for the homeless. However, I'm not sure if it's entirely appropriate to make it so easily accessible, as it could lead to widespread smoking, especially while driving. Plus, it's still seen as taboo in many places. Alcohol, on the other hand, has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more adverse effects on daily life. Both substances have their own adverse effects and can impact people differently based on their personality and how they handle moderation.",
            "I'd say yes,\nBecause,\nUm,\nA lot of their practices are very traditional,\nLike they’ve been doing the same things for a long time,\nAnd,\nIt’s good to have roots in tradition,\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change,\nUm,\nI guess,\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey’re very strict on how things are done,\nAnd,\nSometimes,\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics,\nAnd,\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions,\nUm,\nLike,\nFor instance,\nMy mom was an Episcopalian,\nNo,\nI’m sorry,\nMy dad was an Episcopalian,\nMy mom was a Catholic,\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church,\nBecause of my dad’s religion,\n\nAnd,\nUm,\nThat’s not really,\nLike,\nBeing tolerant of other religions,\nUm,\nWe always learned to,\nYou know,\nLove others,\nThat’s a Catholic teaching,\nBut,\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that,\nSo,\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things,\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it,\nBecause it’s so outdated,\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway,\n\nUm,\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it,\nI mean,\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry,\nBut,\nAs,\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike,\nPedophilic behavior,\nSo,\nBecause it’s just a different realm,\nUm,\nIt might,\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue,\n\nUm,\nWell,\nI guess,\nLike,\nPeople who molest children,\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not,\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse,\nSo if you’re going to do something like that,\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married,\nLike,\nI don’t think,\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent,\nUm,\nThose things from happening,\nI think that would probably happen regardless,\nNope,",
            "Um\nI must admit, I haven't quite formed an opinion on this issue yet\nSo\nI can't definitively say which side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do think this is one of the most complex topics we're facing today\nBecause\nIt's a delicate balance between the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage\nSo\nI don't really know\nI think\nI think that\nAll civil unions\nI don't know if marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it's a sacrament, like\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like what kind of marriage it was\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh, two people got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on their own.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you'll understand its stance. I believe that living in a state means accepting its stance on issues like this. I feel that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think legalization should be based on the discretion of each state.\n\nBush's ban on gay marriage seems unfair, as he doesn't live in every state. He shouldn't decide how each state runs. His term is short, so if a democratic president lifts the ban, it will just swing back and forth. It should be up to each state to decide, as they'll have to live with the consequences. I don't think it's right for the president to dictate these kinds of policies.",
            "Well, let me tell you, I don’t think it’s fair at all. A bulletin board, like what you find on Myspace, is meant to be something public, right? If you use it to post, you’re doing it for everyone to see. That’s the point. Now, if you post something weird or inappropriate, you can’t blame the school for checking it out, especially if it’s to keep everyone safe. After all, it’s their responsibility to make sure the students are safe, and if checking out public posts helps them do that, then I don’t see a problem with it. But if they’re just snooping around on the internet to catch students in the act, that’s a different story. That’s an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that could help keep the school safe, I don’t think that’s an issue. As long as it’s not just to cause trouble, it’s fine. But yeah, I think we can agree that once something is on the internet, it’s always going to be there. And it’s not like you can just delete it and pretend it never happened. You have to be careful with what you post. Like, if you were to write something about someone that’s not nice, you wouldn’t want that to get out, right? Especially since it could come back to haunt you later. So, yeah, I think that’s all I have to say about that.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes in their views. The Church has been facing a decline in followers because it often isn't very accepting of many societal changes. For example, the Church's stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as old-fashioned and not in line with modern beliefs. If the Church were to adapt to a more contemporary perspective on these issues, it might not struggle as much with maintaining its follower base. People are starting to turn away from the Church because they don't agree with its views on these subjects. For instance, someone who supports abortion or gay marriage might not find it comfortable to follow a religion that views these practices as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past incidents. The Church's teachings are so ingrained that I'm not certain how allowing priests to marry or have female priests would have altered their actions. I don't see why priests can't also have a family life alongside their religious duties, as many other professionals in the world do. So, while I don’t think these changes would necessarily prevent past incidents, I do believe they would make the Church more open and relatable to a broader audience.",
            "Um, I'm not opposed to gay marriage, to be honest. I think that people are born that way, regardless of what they choose. It's not like they can consciously make that decision. So, I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I mean, it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about this topic much, but I would definitely say it's wrong. It seems like it's not a choice, and they don't have a choice on how they are. Like, I was born straight, and someone else was born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved. It's not really a legal or moral issue. I mean, it's just who they are. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I strongly believe that the legalization of gay marriage is a no-brainer. There isn't a compelling reason against it, even though many people argue that it poses a threat to traditional families. It's important to note that there are many different aspects to families, and homosexual couples are no different. They too have the same relationships, roles, and concerns as heterosexual couples. The same civil rights apply to them, such as property taxes and healthcare, where their partners cannot visit them in the hospital or be considered next of kin. This is a flawed practice if you're spending the rest of your life with someone. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples, making it the same kind of relationship. The only difference is the legal recognition, which is what they're asking for, not a religious ceremony. The federal government should make it legal in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. While I understand that President Bush has strong views on this issue, it's crucial to consider the government's role in promoting equality and not enforcing religious standards on the entire population. It's hypocritical to have the government enforce religious standards while opposing simple amendments like 'under God' in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage due to the misconception that gay people are psychologically damaged, which is not backed by research. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth. It's crucial to base our beliefs on evidence rather than popular opinion or personal biases.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and let me tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. I mean, there are plenty of illegal substances that we use in the pharmacy for legitimate medicinal purposes. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's a controlled substance, but we use it because it has benefits that outweigh its potential risks. So, I'd argue that marijuana could be considered in a similar light. If we can embrace its beneficial properties and use it responsibly, why not? It's not like heroin or cocaine. It's just a tough substance to deal with, that's all.\n\nYou know, I'm not saying we should legalize it overnight. Maybe we should integrate it gradually, remove the stigma first and then see how it goes. But if we can get rid of that negative image around marijuana, people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly, for medical purposes, it has its place. But no, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol. At least not in the sense that it's a drug that's widely accepted and integrated into society. It's a tough one, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "Um, I believe the church has indeed evolved to accommodate the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be, especially for those who grew up attending Sunday services. I remember wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses as a child, and seeing my friends there on weekends. Now, however, the church has introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often rush in late, and some even arrive in their beach attire. Even at the morning masses where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. While I appreciate the change, the church still has a significant problem on its hands concerning the pedophilia accusations against Catholic priests. I don't believe these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests, as pedophilia is often rooted in genetics and not necessarily a result of marital status. Many religions, like Seventh Heaven, allow their leaders to marry, yet these issues still occur. Therefore, I think the church could have done little to prevent these cases if those involved were predisposed to their attraction towards young children. If they knew and tried to cover it up, that's another story, but I don't think all cases were that way. Besides, the church can't control someone's genetics or nature. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Um, initially, I was okay with the idea. However, given the lingering effects of the September 11th attacks, it seems we invaded Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration initially connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since been proven false, which really gets under my skin. The Iraq war just boils my blood, especially since it feels like the Bush administration lied to the American people, including Colin Powell at the UN. I think this is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I'm convinced the Bush administration had a total disregard for the constitution, marginalizing it since September 11th. It seems they came into office with the intention to go to war.\n\nI remember the Secretary of the Treasury who alleged this in his book after he was forced out, suggesting that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and wanted to expand our energy supply. This was a rather underhanded move, and while I believe it's gone on long enough, I think withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The interim government seems to be crumbling, as evidenced by the ineffective parliament and the rise of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr. This political friction could lead to a power struggle, making the situation even more complicated.\n\nUm, none of this is something I can articulate politely.",
            "I guess I don't really have a strong opinion on the War in Iraq. I mean, it's not like it's a declared war or anything, right? I think it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being behind them. I'm not much of a news junkie, so I don't keep up with the details, but I know we're there to try and build a democracy, which isn't easy, and to maybe get some oil. But I don't think it's a good reason to stay there. If we leave, they might be mad, and if we stay, we're just pouring resources into it. It's a tough situation, and I don't think it's fair to say it should end or not end. I know families with kids in Iraq, and it's hard to want them to come home, but I also worry about the cultural differences and how trying to change them could backfire. I think it's a messy situation that might go on for a long time.",
            "I admit, I’m not feeling it. I believe it’s not right to make it legal, or for a state to even declare it as such. I think it’s something the churches should decide, given that the constitution's separation of church and state is clear and well-defined. Trying to enforce power over it would be defying what’s already been established. I don’t think it’s right for the government to choose one church’s belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don’t feel it’s up to the government to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of our constitution, and any amendment would be contradictory, probably one of the few amendments that restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment seems to be based on personal beliefs rather than logical reasoning. I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society. I think it could have a positive impact on society, but I’m not sure how. I’ve pretty much covered it all.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo get started, I believe the government didn't fully disclose the reasons for going to war with Iraq to the American people. Firstly, they tried to connect the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which was largely unfounded. The government exploited the public's anger and outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003.\nI myself am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, particularly the high cost in American lives. Removing a country's government is one thing, but preparing for the aftermath is quite another.\nThe government didn't seem ready for the void of power and the chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government. They were trying to implement a democratic government, similar to their attempt to remove communists and establish democracy in Vietnam. However, this process is complex and time-consuming.\nI believe the government wasn't adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They made it seem like a short, successful stay, which was naïve. We shouldn't have believed that establishing a democratic government would be easy. It took years to achieve in our own country, and there were plenty of struggles along the way.\nIn the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for potentially voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, once we're in a war for so long, how can we abandon the people we've disrupted? We removed their government and way of life, so how can we leave them now?\nThere's also the matter of American casualties. How much risk is too much for a free democratic Iraq? The whole reason for invading Iraq was supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? The main reason is likely oil, given that Iraq is a significant source of our oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\nBefore going to war, there was a claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Other countries like North Korea, which have such weapons, aren't being targeted for the same reasons. I don't think the government is being thorough or honest in their decision-making.\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq, but it might be a long way off.",
            "So, let me start by saying that I've always been for gay marriage, and I still am. I really believe it's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. I think it's inhumane to take away rights from people based on something they can't control. I've been an advocate for gay marriage for a long time.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a role in this. It's a personal, household-level decision, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, I have a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, and I see no difference between them and anyone else. Bush's interpretation of marriage is ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that homosexuality might be a predisposition, something you're born with, not something you choose. It's not about growing up in a specific environment, like having four sisters and no father. So, I think it's biological, not sociological.\n\nOther than the obvious, I think marriage should be a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do so without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it's splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something in the public eye or national domain.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "It's important to remember that the internet is a public forum. Whatever you post is accessible to everyone. As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.

The internet is seen by everyone, including your friends on Myspace, who will receive the bulletin. The school has to take it seriously and act upon it, regardless of whether it's just a joke or actually serious. They can't ignore it because something might happen and they could have prevented it. Similarly, if you're a student and someone hears something concerning and reports it, the school needs to investigate.

            "I believe the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in a country with an unfair political system. However, I think we've lost sight of this original purpose and now it feels like we're fighting just to assert our global power. There were also questionable motives, given George Bush's father's past feud with Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to provide a democratic government, that would be a fair cause. But over time, I sense the motivation has deteriorated, and it seems we're still at war just to have a decisive end. I think it's gone on long enough, and it's time to let their government handle itself. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which is a drain on our economy. There are pressing issues here at home, such as poverty and infrastructure, that we should be addressing. It's a shame to be spending so much money on war when there are so many needs at home. This war should not be part of our long-term budget. I firmly believe we should focus on our own issues and let the other country stand on its own.",
            "I have a question that needs clarification. Would it be an invasion of privacy if someone went online and found something concerning that someone else had posted on a site like Myspace? I mean, if you put information on the internet, it's essentially available for anyone to see, especially if you're on a platform where you need to have friends to view your profile. So, if I think that was a good thing, that someone saw something and was able to prevent a tragedy, it's tough because you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles. But then again, it might become discriminatory if they only target certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I'm a bit uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can access my profile. I saw on TV once where a man easily found someone's screen name and convinced them to meet him. It's unsettling when people can look at my schedule or photos and know a lot about me. I only accept people I know on my profile, but it's still a tricky issue. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to make such a rule.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two more things I want to mention about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about this\nI mean, I hate to say I was against it\nHate to join the crowd that says \"I was against it from the start\"\nUm\nI was, but it’s not really important anymore\nCause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea\nExcept within the administration\nUm\nThey don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, you know, you just have to look at the polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nIraqi polls\nGlobal polls\nUm\nAnd the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nSeventy percent of the U.S. troops think it was a dumb idea\nUm\nAnd pulling out is going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, it’s just the cultural clash between the U.S. and the Middle East\nIt’s a huge gap\nUm\nAnd for the administration to think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn’t exist\nIt’s just not going to happen\nUm\nAnd yeah, Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons\nBefore you invade a country\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, the administration might have some hopeful ideas\nBut I’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nUm\nI mean, if we want to do it gradually over a year or more\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t have a problem with that\nBut just leaving now seems like the best option\nUm\nAnd you know, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year\nAnd at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now\nUm\nAnd they’re the people we’re trying to help\nUm\nSo, if they say they want us to leave, we should listen\nUm\nAnd at least if we ask them, and they say yes, then it’s not on us if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd you know, if we decide to help out afterwards, we’ll at least be the good guys\nUm\nOr at least better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Yes, I indeed believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, not just with women, but across various fields and roles. For instance, in the workplace, women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they may not be considered for promotions or positions of power because of societal expectations and historical norms.\n\nSimilarly, men can also face discrimination, especially in fields like fashion or in the role of a stay-at-home parent. It's quite uncommon for men to be the primary caregiver in a family, and society often looks down upon this because of traditional gender roles. Additionally, in the fashion industry, men might not be taken seriously if they are interested in fashion, as it's typically viewed as a female-dominated field.\n\nThe challenges extend further into other industries and job roles. For example, people who grew up in certain environments or have accents might be discriminated against, even if they possess great intelligence. This is because societal perceptions and biases can cloud judgments about a person's competence.\n\nChanging these perceptions and biases is a slow process, as societal mindsets are deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress, with women increasingly taking on higher positions and men becoming more accepted in certain roles. However, change often comes gradually, and it's crucial to promote these changes without forcing them, allowing society to adapt naturally. Sometimes, simply showcasing the positive qualities and capabilities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help shift perceptions.",
            "Here's my understanding of the situation: The legal status of marijuana has changed. They've moved it from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket, which means getting caught with it just results in a citation rather than arrest. This is because it's costly for municipalities to arrest, book, and prosecute people, and it's also considered a waste of resources. Some places like Denver, which are more open to these types of policies, have legalized marijuana. This has freed up money for public education, social programs, and food programs for the homeless. However, I'm not sure if it's entirely appropriate to make it so easily accessible, as it could lead to widespread smoking, especially while driving. Plus, it's still seen as taboo in many places. Alcohol, on the other hand, has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more adverse effects on daily life. Both substances have their own adverse effects and can impact people differently based on their personality and how they handle moderation.",
            "I'd say yes,\nBecause,\nUm,\nA lot of their practices are very traditional,\nLike they’ve been doing the same things for a long time,\nAnd,\nIt’s good to have roots in tradition,\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change,\nUm,\nI guess,\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey’re very strict on how things are done,\nAnd,\nSometimes,\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics,\nAnd,\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions,\nUm,\nLike,\nFor instance,\nMy mom was an Episcopalian,\nNo,\nI’m sorry,\nMy dad was an Episcopalian,\nMy mom was a Catholic,\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church,\nBecause of my dad’s religion,\n\nAnd,\nUm,\nThat’s not really,\nLike,\nBeing tolerant of other religions,\nUm,\nWe always learned to,\nYou know,\nLove others,\nThat’s a Catholic teaching,\nBut,\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that,\nSo,\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things,\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it,\nBecause it’s so outdated,\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway,\n\nUm,\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it,\nI mean,\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry,\nBut,\nAs,\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike,\nPedophilic behavior,\nSo,\nBecause it’s just a different realm,\nUm,\nIt might,\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue,\n\nUm,\nWell,\nI guess,\nLike,\nPeople who molest children,\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not,\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse,\nSo if you’re going to do something like that,\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married,\nLike,\nI don’t think,\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent,\nUm,\nThose things from happening,\nI think that would probably happen regardless,\nNope,",
            "Um\nI must admit, I haven't quite formed an opinion on this issue yet\nSo\nI can't definitively say which side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do think this is one of the most complex topics we're facing today\nBecause\nIt's a delicate balance between the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage\nSo\nI don't really know\nI think\nI think that\nAll civil unions\nI don't know if marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it's a sacrament, like\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like what kind of marriage it was\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh, two people got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on their own.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you'll understand its stance. I believe that living in a state means accepting its stance on issues like this. I feel that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think legalization should be based on the discretion of each state.\n\nBush's ban on gay marriage seems unfair, as he doesn't live in every state. He shouldn't decide how each state runs. His term is short, so if a democratic president lifts the ban, it will just swing back and forth. It should be up to each state to decide, as they'll have to live with the consequences. I don't think it's right for the president to dictate these kinds of policies.",
            "Well, let me tell you, I don’t think it’s fair at all. A bulletin board, like what you find on Myspace, is meant to be something public, right? If you use it to post, you’re doing it for everyone to see. That’s the point. Now, if you post something weird or inappropriate, you can’t blame the school for checking it out, especially if it’s to keep everyone safe. After all, it’s their responsibility to make sure the students are safe, and if checking out public posts helps them do that, then I don’t see a problem with it. But if they’re just snooping around on the internet to catch students in the act, that’s a different story. That’s an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that could help keep the school safe, I don’t think that’s an issue. As long as it’s not just to cause trouble, it’s fine. But yeah, I think we can agree that once something is on the internet, it’s always going to be there. And it’s not like you can just delete it and pretend it never happened. You have to be careful with what you post. Like, if you were to write something about someone that’s not nice, you wouldn’t want that to get out, right? Especially since it could come back to haunt you later. So, yeah, I think that’s all I have to say about that.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes in their views. The Church has been facing a decline in followers because it often isn't very accepting of many societal changes. For example, the Church's stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as old-fashioned and not in line with modern beliefs. If the Church were to adapt to a more contemporary perspective on these issues, it might not struggle as much with maintaining its follower base. People are starting to turn away from the Church because they don't agree with its views on these subjects. For instance, someone who supports abortion or gay marriage might not find it comfortable to follow a religion that views these practices as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past incidents. The Church's teachings are so ingrained that I'm not certain how allowing priests to marry or have female priests would have altered their actions. I don't see why priests can't also have a family life alongside their religious duties, as many other professionals in the world do. So, while I don’t think these changes would necessarily prevent past incidents, I do believe they would make the Church more open and relatable to a broader audience.",
            "Um, I'm not opposed to gay marriage, to be honest. I think that people are born that way, regardless of what they choose. It's not like they can consciously make that decision. So, I don't think gay people should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I mean, it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really thought about this topic much, but I would definitely say it's wrong. It seems like it's not a choice, and they don't have a choice on how they are. Like, I was born straight, and someone else was born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I think it's wrong for the federal government to get involved. It's not really a legal or moral issue. I mean, it's just who they are. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I strongly believe that the legalization of gay marriage is a no-brainer. There isn't a compelling reason against it, even though many people argue that it poses a threat to traditional families. It's important to note that there are many different aspects to families, and homosexual couples are no different. They too have the same relationships, roles, and concerns as heterosexual couples. The same civil rights apply to them, such as property taxes and healthcare, where their partners cannot visit them in the hospital or be considered next of kin. This is a flawed practice if you're spending the rest of your life with someone. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples, making it the same kind of relationship. The only difference is the legal recognition, which is what they're asking for, not a religious ceremony. The federal government should make it legal in every state and amend the constitution to reflect this. While I understand that President Bush has strong views on this issue, it's crucial to consider the government's role in promoting equality and not enforcing religious standards on the entire population. It's hypocritical to have the government enforce religious standards while opposing simple amendments like 'under God' in the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage due to the misconception that gay people are psychologically damaged, which is not backed by research. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth. It's crucial to base our beliefs on evidence rather than popular opinion or personal biases.",
            "You know, I work in a hospital pharmacy this summer, and let me tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. I mean, there are plenty of illegal substances that we use in the pharmacy for legitimate medicinal purposes. Take oxycodone, for instance. It's a controlled substance, but we use it because it has benefits that outweigh its potential risks. So, I'd argue that marijuana could be considered in a similar light. If we can embrace its beneficial properties and use it responsibly, why not? It's not like heroin or cocaine. It's just a tough substance to deal with, that's all.\n\nYou know, I'm not saying we should legalize it overnight. Maybe we should integrate it gradually, remove the stigma first and then see how it goes. But if we can get rid of that negative image around marijuana, people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly, for medical purposes, it has its place. But no, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol. At least not in the sense that it's a drug that's widely accepted and integrated into society. It's a tough one, but I think it's worth considering.",
            "Um, I believe the church has indeed evolved to accommodate the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it used to be, especially for those who grew up attending Sunday services. I remember wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and purses as a child, and seeing my friends there on weekends. Now, however, the church has introduced a 'teenager mass' that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Families often rush in late, and some even arrive in their beach attire. Even at the morning masses where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. While I appreciate the change, the church still has a significant problem on its hands concerning the pedophilia accusations against Catholic priests. I don't believe these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests, as pedophilia is often rooted in genetics and not necessarily a result of marital status. Many religions, like Seventh Heaven, allow their leaders to marry, yet these issues still occur. Therefore, I think the church could have done little to prevent these cases if those involved were predisposed to their attraction towards young children. If they knew and tried to cover it up, that's another story, but I don't think all cases were that way. Besides, the church can't control someone's genetics or nature. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Um, initially, I was okay with the idea. However, given the lingering effects of the September 11th attacks, it seems we invaded Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush administration initially connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since been proven false, which really gets under my skin. The Iraq war just boils my blood, especially since it feels like the Bush administration lied to the American people, including Colin Powell at the UN. I think this is a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I'm convinced the Bush administration had a total disregard for the constitution, marginalizing it since September 11th. It seems they came into office with the intention to go to war.\n\nI remember the Secretary of the Treasury who alleged this in his book after he was forced out, suggesting that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and wanted to expand our energy supply. This was a rather underhanded move, and while I believe it's gone on long enough, I think withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might cause more long-term problems due to Iraq's sovereignty issues. The interim government seems to be crumbling, as evidenced by the ineffective parliament and the rise of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr. This political friction could lead to a power struggle, making the situation even more complicated.\n\nUm, none of this is something I can articulate politely.",
            "I guess I don't really have a strong opinion on the War in Iraq. I mean, it's not like it's a declared war or anything, right? I think it was more of a reaction to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being behind them. I'm not much of a news junkie, so I don't keep up with the details, but I know we're there to try and build a democracy, which isn't easy, and to maybe get some oil. But I don't think it's a good reason to stay there. If we leave, they might be mad, and if we stay, we're just pouring resources into it. It's a tough situation, and I don't think it's fair to say it should end or not end. I know families with kids in Iraq, and it's hard to want them to come home, but I also worry about the cultural differences and how trying to change them could backfire. I think it's a messy situation that might go on for a long time.",
            "I admit, I’m not feeling it. I believe it’s not right to make it legal, or for a state to even declare it as such. I think it’s something the churches should decide, given that the constitution's separation of church and state is clear and well-defined. Trying to enforce power over it would be defying what’s already been established. I don’t think it’s right for the government to choose one church’s belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don’t feel it’s up to the government to decide what the churches can and can’t make illegal. Separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of our constitution, and any amendment would be contradictory, probably one of the few amendments that restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The push for this amendment seems to be based on personal beliefs rather than logical reasoning. I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society. I think it could have a positive impact on society, but I’m not sure how. I’ve pretty much covered it all.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo get started, I believe the government didn't fully disclose the reasons for going to war with Iraq to the American people. Firstly, they tried to connect the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which was largely unfounded. The government exploited the public's anger and outrage over the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion, which began in 2003.\nI myself am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, particularly the high cost in American lives. Removing a country's government is one thing, but preparing for the aftermath is quite another.\nThe government didn't seem ready for the void of power and the chaos that followed the removal of the Iraqi government. They were trying to implement a democratic government, similar to their attempt to remove communists and establish democracy in Vietnam. However, this process is complex and time-consuming.\nI believe the government wasn't adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. They made it seem like a short, successful stay, which was naïve. We shouldn't have believed that establishing a democratic government would be easy. It took years to achieve in our own country, and there were plenty of struggles along the way.\nIn the 2004 presidential election, one of my reasons for potentially voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, once we're in a war for so long, how can we abandon the people we've disrupted? We removed their government and way of life, so how can we leave them now?\nThere's also the matter of American casualties. How much risk is too much for a free democratic Iraq? The whole reason for invading Iraq was supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? The main reason is likely oil, given that Iraq is a significant source of our oil, and it's often about controlling resources.\nBefore going to war, there was a claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Other countries like North Korea, which have such weapons, aren't being targeted for the same reasons. I don't think the government is being thorough or honest in their decision-making.\nI just hope the war ends soon and that there's peace in Iraq, but it might be a long way off.",
            "So, let me start by saying that I've always been for gay marriage, and I still am. I really believe it's a personal preference, and it's something that's been proven to be more biological than sociological. I think it's inhumane to take away rights from people based on something they can't control. I've been an advocate for gay marriage for a long time.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a role in this. It's a personal, household-level decision, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, I have a couple of openly gay couples who function just like any other family. They walk their dogs, and I see no difference between them and anyone else. Bush's interpretation of marriage is ridiculous.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that homosexuality might be a predisposition, something you're born with, not something you choose. It's not about growing up in a specific environment, like having four sisters and no father. So, I think it's biological, not sociological.\n\nOther than the obvious, I think marriage should be a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do so without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it's splashed all over the news. I think it should be a private, personal thing, not something in the public eye or national domain.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "It's important to remember that the internet is a public forum. Whatever you post is accessible to everyone. As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.

The internet is seen by everyone, including your friends on Myspace, who will receive the bulletin. The school has to take it seriously and act upon it, regardless of whether it's just a joke or actually serious. They can't ignore it because something might happen and they could have prevented it. Similarly, if you're a student and someone hears something concerning and reports it, the school needs to investigate.

            "I believe the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable—to restore democracy in a country with an unfair political system. However, I think we've lost sight of this original purpose and now it feels like we're fighting just to assert our global power. There were also questionable motives, given George Bush's father's past feud with Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to provide a democratic government, that would be a fair cause. But over time, I sense the motivation has deteriorated, and it seems we're still at war just to have a decisive end. I think it's gone on long enough, and it's time to let their government handle itself. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which is a drain on our economy. There are pressing issues here at home, such as poverty and infrastructure, that we should be addressing. It's a shame to be spending so much money on war when there are so many needs at home. This war should not be part of our long-term budget. I firmly believe we should focus on our own issues and let the other country stand on its own.",
            "I have a question that needs clarification. Would it be an invasion of privacy if someone went online and found something concerning that someone else had posted on a site like Myspace? I mean, if you put information on the internet, it's essentially available for anyone to see, especially if you're on a platform where you need to have friends to view your profile. So, if I think that was a good thing, that someone saw something and was able to prevent a tragedy, it's tough because you can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles. But then again, it might become discriminatory if they only target certain students. It all depends on the situation. I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I'm a bit uncomfortable knowing that there are creepy people out there who can access my profile. I saw on TV once where a man easily found someone's screen name and convinced them to meet him. It's unsettling when people can look at my schedule or photos and know a lot about me. I only accept people I know on my profile, but it's still a tricky issue. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how high school officials had the right to make such a rule.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have these two more things I want to mention about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about this\nI mean, I hate to say I was against it\nHate to join the crowd that says \"I was against it from the start\"\nUm\nI was, but it’s not really important anymore\nCause the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea\nExcept within the administration\nUm\nThey don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd, you know, you just have to look at the polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nIraqi polls\nGlobal polls\nUm\nAnd the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nSeventy percent of the U.S. troops think it was a dumb idea\nUm\nAnd pulling out is going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to handle the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, it’s just the cultural clash between the U.S. and the Middle East\nIt’s a huge gap\nUm\nAnd for the administration to think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn’t exist\nIt’s just not going to happen\nUm\nAnd yeah, Saddam was a bad guy\nBut you have to weigh the pros and cons\nBefore you invade a country\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, the administration might have some hopeful ideas\nBut I’ve yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay\nUm\nAnd the problems that might arise from pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nUm\nI mean, if we want to do it gradually over a year or more\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t have a problem with that\nBut just leaving now seems like the best option\nUm\nAnd you know, eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year\nAnd at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now\nUm\nAnd they’re the people we’re trying to help\nUm\nSo, if they say they want us to leave, we should listen\nUm\nAnd at least if we ask them, and they say yes, then it’s not on us if something goes wrong\nUm\nAnd you know, if we decide to help out afterwards, we’ll at least be the good guys\nUm\nOr at least better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Yes, I indeed believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, not just with women, but across various fields and roles. For instance, in the workplace, women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where they may not be considered for promotions or positions of power because of societal expectations and historical norms.\n\nSimilarly, men can also face discrimination, especially in fields like fashion or in the role of a stay-at-home parent. It's quite uncommon for men to be the primary caregiver in a family, and society often looks down upon this because of traditional gender roles. Additionally, in the fashion industry, men might not be taken seriously if they are interested in fashion, as it's typically viewed as a female-dominated field.\n\nThe challenges extend further into other industries and job roles. For example, people who grew up in certain environments or have accents might be discriminated against, even if they possess great intelligence. This is because societal perceptions and biases can cloud judgments about a person's competence.\n\nChanging these perceptions and biases is a slow process, as societal mindsets are deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress, with women increasingly taking on higher positions and men becoming more accepted in certain roles. However, change often comes gradually, and it's crucial to promote these changes without forcing them, allowing society to adapt naturally. Sometimes, simply showcasing the positive qualities and capabilities of those stereotypically discriminated against can help shift perceptions.",
            "Here's my understanding of the situation: The legal status of marijuana has changed. They've moved it from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket, which means getting caught with it just results in a citation rather than arrest. This is because it's costly for municipalities to arrest, book, and prosecute people, and it's also considered a waste of resources. Some places like Denver, which are more open to these types of policies, have legalized marijuana. This has freed up money for public education, social programs, and food programs for the homeless. However, I'm not sure if it's entirely appropriate to make it so easily accessible, as it could lead to widespread smoking, especially while driving. Plus, it's still seen as taboo in many places. Alcohol, on the other hand, has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have more adverse effects on daily life. Both substances have their own adverse effects and can impact people differently based on their personality and how they handle moderation.",
            "I'd say yes,\nBecause,\nUm,\nA lot of their practices are very traditional,\nLike they’ve been doing the same things for a long time,\nAnd,\nIt’s good to have roots in tradition,\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change,\nUm,\nI guess,\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey’re very strict on how things are done,\nAnd,\nSometimes,\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics,\nAnd,\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions,\nUm,\nLike,\nFor instance,\nMy mom was an Episcopalian,\nNo,\nI’m sorry,\nMy dad was an Episcopalian,\nMy mom was a Catholic,\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church,\nBecause of my dad’s religion,\n\nAnd,\nUm,\nThat’s not really,\nLike,\nBeing tolerant of other religions,\nUm,\nWe always learned to,\nYou know,\nLove others,\nThat’s a Catholic teaching,\nBut,\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that,\nSo,\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things,\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it,\nBecause it’s so outdated,\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway,\n\nUm,\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it,\nI mean,\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry,\nBut,\nAs,\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike,\nPedophilic behavior,\nSo,\nBecause it’s just a different realm,\nUm,\nIt might,\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue,\n\nUm,\nWell,\nI guess,\nLike,\nPeople who molest children,\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not,\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse,\nSo if you’re going to do something like that,\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married,\nLike,\nI don’t think,\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent,\nUm,\nThose things from happening,\nI think that would probably happen regardless,\nNope,",
            "Um\nI must admit, I haven't quite formed an opinion on this issue yet\nSo\nI can't definitively say which side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do think this is one of the most complex topics we're facing today\nBecause\nIt's a delicate balance between the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage\nSo\nI don't really know\nI think\nI think that\nAll civil unions\nI don't know if marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it's a sacrament, like\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nLooked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like what kind of marriage it was\nTwo people got unioned together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh, two people got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide on their own.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you'll understand its stance. I believe that living in a state means accepting its stance on issues like this. I feel that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think legalization should be based on the discretion of each state.\n\nBush's ban on gay marriage seems unfair, as he doesn't live in every state. He shouldn't decide how each state runs. His term is short, so if a democratic president lifts the ban, it will just swing back and forth. It should be up to each state to decide, as they'll have to live with the consequences. I don't think it's right for the president to dictate these kinds of policies.",
            "Well, let me tell you, I don’t think it’s fair at all. A bulletin board, like what you find on Myspace, is meant to be something public, right? If you use it to post, you’re doing it for everyone to see. That’s the point. Now, if you post something weird or inappropriate, you can’t blame the school for checking it out, especially if it’s to keep everyone safe. After all, it’s their responsibility to make sure the students are safe, and if checking out public posts helps them do that, then I don’t see a problem with it. But if they’re just snooping around on the internet to catch students in the act, that’s a different story. That’s an invasion of privacy. However, if they find something that could help keep the school safe, I don’t think that’s an issue. As long as it’s not just to cause trouble, it’s fine. But yeah, I think we can agree that once something is on the internet, it’s always going to be there. And it’s not like you can just delete it and pretend it never happened. You have to be careful with what you post. Like, if you were to write something about someone that’s not nice, you wouldn’t want that to get out, right? Especially since it could come back to haunt you later. So, yeah, I think that’s all I have to say about that.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. They have been grappling with a decline in followers, and I believe this is due to their lack of acceptance on numerous issues. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control can be quite rigid. I think if they were to evolve their thinking a bit, they might not face such a loss in their following.\n\nI've heard that many are starting to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these topics. People are no longer aligned with their stances on these issues, which is causing them to feel uncomfortable within the church. For example, if you support abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if you're for gay marriage, you might struggle in a following that doesn't agree with it.\n\nI don't understand why the Catholic Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. The church claims that priests are married to God, yet everyone else in the world has both a job and a family life. I'm not sure why priests can't have both as well.",
            "In my opinion, I’m not against gay marriage. I honestly don’t see it as a conscious choice that gay people make. It just seems like they are born that way, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. I don’t think it’s right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can’t. I haven’t given it much thought, but I would definitely say that’s wrong. It’s not like they have a say in how they are born. I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this. It’s not a legal or moral issue, and I don’t think they have a right to interfere in people’s lives. It’s just who they are, and they shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s all.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, and here’s why. There's really no solid reason to oppose it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's actually quite different. It’s like comparing two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, yet it's essentially the same thing. Let’s talk about the practical aspects. Many civil rights are tied to marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in a hospital or visit you because they're not technically family. That seems silly if you're spending your life with someone. Plus, scientific studies show that homosexual couples have the same relationship success rates and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main issue is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to marry in a church, they just want a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no religious involvement, it shouldn't be an issue. Some people, like Catholics, argue that it’s against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It’s like segregation: separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, like relationship roles played by partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, but again, the main concern is how children are treated. In New York City, for instance, children of gay parents have special schools because they face bullying in public schools. But parenting skills don't differ between gay and straight couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should be changed to reflect that.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, largely based on his religion, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of his reasons are moral, which vary from person to person. It’s unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It’s hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on an entire country, considering the recent controversy over \"under God” in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged. But the American Psychological Association says this is untrue. If we listened to institutions that do research and studies, society might see things differently.",
            "Let me start by sharing my experience working as a pharmacy intern over the summer. Now, it's important to note that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. I strongly believe that while we should not make it widely available to the public just yet, utilizing it for medicinal purposes is a different story. For instance, there are controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin that are often used in a clinical setting because they provide genuine benefits. Denying these benefits just because of marijuana's taboo status is not productive in my opinion.\n\nI must also emphasize that while marijuana and alcohol are both subject to abuse, marijuana is generally considered less harmful. Integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could be a viable solution. First, we should remove the stigma associated with marijuana to encourage responsible use. If we can achieve this, people might be better equipped to use marijuana responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, I contend that the benefits of marijuana should not be dismissed solely based on its illegal status. By embracing its medicinal properties and addressing the taboo surrounding it, we can pave the way for a more responsible and regulated future for marijuana.",
            "I believe the church has made adjustments to adapt to the twenty-first century. It isn't as rigid as it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends, but now, as I've aged, they've introduced a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer when you'll see folks in beach clothes, and families often arrive late. Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. The church I know has also seen a shift in its political landscape, but I'm not privy to the intricacies. Overall, I think it has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Married men can still become pedophiles due to their genetics, and it's not always a lifestyle choice. Many religions allow their clergy to marry, but if a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I believe pedophilia is primarily genetic rather than environmental, and marriage wouldn't change that. If the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, it's shameful, but I believe in many cases, they may not have been aware. I have no other significant thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but as we were still recovering from the September 11th attacks, everyone was quite shaken. The Bush administration used various pretexts to justify going into Iraq, claiming connections to Osama Bin Laden and linking the war to the attacks. They also alleged that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know were never proven true. This really grates on me, and the Iraq war has always made my blood boil.\n\nI believe the Bush administration straightforwardly lied to the American people and has not taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who gave a major presentation at the UN, later admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. They have shown complete disregard for the Constitution and have been trying to undermine it ever since, especially since September 11th. I think they entered office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t recall the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made this allegation in his book after being forced out, but it seems like the younger Bush was driven by a sense of blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. He also had long-term plans to expand our energy supply, which was quite underhanded. However, I believe the situation has dragged on long enough.\n\nIf we withdraw now, there’s a high risk of civil war and even more deaths. The alternative being considered by the UN and the US is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. However, I'm not sure this is a good idea in the long term because it will bring up issues of Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, as the news reports suggest the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister seems to lack control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting against less than a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in the Iraqi Parliament. The political process is quite tumultuous due to these radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this can be articulated in polite company.",
            "I guess I don't really know how I feel about the War in Iraq. I mean, it's like, what's the point? It wasn't even declared a war. It's more like a big get-back-at-Iraq thing, right? I mean, who do we think did 9/11? So, I don't really follow the details of it, but I know we're kind of just over there trying to build democracy and get oil. But it's not making anyone happy, and if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up again. It's so confusing! I mean, it's like, why are we still there? I don't know! I'm not really for the war, but I don't know if I'm against it either. It's hard to say. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it doesn't feel like one. We just have all these big guns and stuff to show we're powerful. But I don't think it's fair. It's like the Vietnam War, it was never declared, and now it's called a meaningless war. And I don't want Bush to be remembered as the worst president ever. It's just so unfair. And there are so many families with kids in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. But if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into something they're not. And that could make things worse. I mean, who knows what's going to happen in the end? It's just so hard to say. I guess it's going to go on for years.",
            "I strongly feel it's not appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to even consider it. I believe it's a matter that should be left to the churches, as the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any regulations over it would be a breach of what's already established in the constitution. I find it hypocritical for those who are pushing for its illegality to impose their beliefs on others, particularly when most Catholics and Christians oppose it. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of our constitution, promoting religious tolerance. I don't see why making an amendment about this issue would be necessary or beneficial, as it would only restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this at all. The president's push for this amendment is clearly driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it's not justified by any logical or economic reasons. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece on this topic.",
            "Ok, let's talk about the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to get started, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, they had very little to do with each other. The government used the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the terrorist attacks, to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nNow, I'm generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the government should have learned from the Vietnam War. The Iraq War was, in many ways, similar to Vietnam. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic government, just like they did in Vietnam. But they were not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and more importantly, they were not prepared for the insurgents who fought against them.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes. The war in Iraq has been going on for years, and many American troops have died. The U.S. is still there today, trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I don't think the government was prepared for it.\n\nThe U.S. government also made it seem like the invasion would be a short, successful mission, which was naïve. It's not an easy thing to implement a new form of government, especially after a long war. It took our own country a long time to become the powerful democracy it is today, with a lot of tension and civil war along the way.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to let him finish what he started, because it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping. But at the same time, we need to consider the staggering number of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the main reason is oil. The U.S. is getting its oil from Iraq, and it's usually all about money and controlling resources. Before the invasion, there were claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Yet, places like North Korea, which we know have these weapons, are not being attacked. I don't think the U.S. government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's been proven to have biological roots rather than sociological ones. This means that denying people the right to marry someone they love based on something they can't control is inhumane. I've always advocated for gay marriage and I believe that politics and government should stay out of people's personal lives. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who don't have the same rights as straight couples, but they function just like any other family. I think it's ridiculous for politicians to try and interpret marriage in a way that suits them. It's a personal matter, not a national or federal concern. I've heard from many sources that being homosexual can be influenced by biology, not upbringing. For example, a chemical reaction in the brain might predispose someone to be homosexual, rather than societal factors. It's unfair that two people can get married in secret without anyone knowing, but two gay people wanting to do the same gets front-page news. I believe marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal, and now it appears we're simply continuing the conflict to assert our status as a global superpower. Perhaps there were personal interests at play, like the previous feud between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While spreading democracy was a valid motivation, any hint of personal gain would have been unfair. I believe our initial goal was achieved in the first few months, as the war's start itself was a significant statement. Still, the prolonged conflict has left the original purpose diluted and misconceived, as it seems we're still at war for the sake of being at war, aiming for a decisive end that may never come.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on far too long. If our main objective was to install democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a just cause. However, I don't think our reasons have stayed true to this original intent. It seems we're still waging war just to wage war, without a clear end goal in sight. It's high time we let the local government take the reins and step back, as they will eventually have to handle their own affairs anyway. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, which could be better spent addressing our own pressing issues like poverty and infrastructure. It's a drain on our economy to keep funding a war that has lost its purpose over time.",
            "I wanted to clarify something. It seems that the situation you're referring to was prevented because someone went online and found some information. Anyway, I think it's okay. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much accessible to everyone. You have to understand that when you give someone access to your profile, you're allowing them to see it. So, if someone spotted something and prevented a situation, that's not an invasion of privacy. However, it might be difficult to monitor every profile to ensure safety, but it becomes discriminatory if they only target the \"bad kids.\" It depends on the context—whether they were actively searching for something specific or just stumbled upon it. I don't know, it's a tricky issue. I use Facebook, and I'm always aware that there are creepy people out there. I saw a TV show where a man easily found someone's information and convinced her to meet him. It's scary. Sometimes, people I don't recognize on my class list IM me, and I wonder if they know too much about me. It's a dangerous game balancing privacy and communication. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can see what. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seems a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or if they had the right to do that. It's a complex situation.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it\nNot only with women though\nI feel it has to do with the specific field of work that you’re engaged in\nUm\nI mean, for the most part, I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s this glass ceiling where, even though there’s supposed to be equality, many people struggle to work under a woman if they are a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, a lot of times in the workplace, women might see a job they’re qualified for\nBut the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd um\nI guess the same goes for men too\nAnd like other industries like fashion or\nUm being a parent at home\nIt’s really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male\nAnd um\nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you’re the male, you should be out working\nYou should be the money maker of your family\nWhy are you staying at home?\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them and maybe the wife has the better job\nAnd like it’s working out fine for them\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd then in the fashion industry\nUm\nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight\nI don’t know if that really makes sense\nBut I guess it’s because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nLike I guess have different lifestyles\nAnd so if you have the typical lifestyle and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry\nPeople will be like, well wait, how do I really know if you know anything about fashion if you’re a woman?\nLike you don’t really know what our case is like\nLike these other guys\nAnd so\nDepending on the field of work you’re in\nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds\nBut change is really slow so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process\nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works\nAnd um\nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nAnd so they do know what I’m talking about\nSo I guess you kind of have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, by not being too pushy\nBut um saying like the qualities of them\nBecause if you force it, people are going to resist\nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist\nAnd we’ve come a long way and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go on to become a CEO\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don’t know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "I understand that they didn’t outright legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means that getting caught with it is treated more like getting a traffic ticket than a criminal offense. While a decriminalized charge can still have serious future ramifications, such as making it difficult to pass a job interview, it does reduce the immediate consequences of being arrested and booked. On the other hand, there are costs involved in arresting, housing, and bringing individuals to court, especially in financially struggling communities. In a place like Denver, where the community tends to be more open-minded and liberal, decriminalizing marijuana might be a good decision. This could potentially free up funds for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. However, it's important to consider that widespread legalization could lead to marijuana being sold in gas stations and smoked in public, which might not be desirable. Additionally, while alcohol may have more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more enduring impact on an individual's lifestyle. I don't think that either substance should be generalized, as people react differently based on their personalities and behaviors.",
            "In my opinion, yes, there are some things that the Catholic Church has done traditionally that are quite old-fashioned. They've maintained these customs for long periods, which is good for grounding and maintaining traditions. However, it's also crucial to be open-minded to change. Many Catholics feel that they must attend Church weekly and adhere strictly to the Church's rules. This strictness sometimes makes it seem like the Church doesn't accept those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or aren't Catholic. For instance, my parents faced difficulties when it came to getting married in the Church because my father was an Episcopalian. This isn't really tolerant of other religions, which goes against the Church's teachings on loving others. I believe many Catholic doctrines tell us what to do, but the Church's practices don't always align with these teachings due to their outdated nature. I think it's a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't believe it would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. I think priests would act that way whether they're married or not, as the act involves children, not spouses. Therefore, I don't think allowing priests to marry would deter them from these behaviors. In my view, it wouldn't make a difference.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't declare one side as right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most complex topics we're dealing with today. The debate lies between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage, which is tricky without offending anyone. I think civil unions, regardless of the ceremony's religious context, should be treated equally by the government. After all, they're unions between two people, and the government shouldn't concern itself with the type of ceremony or religious significance. But if states can come to a logical consensus, they should push for federal recognition of civil unions. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd; it's not a cause large enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's simply not that important to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "You know, I was brought up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I've got a lot of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each state. I mean, there are so many democratic and republican states, and you can't deny that democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you're choosing to live there, so you should accept that state's position on the issue. I believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think the decision should be up to each state.\n\nI also think Bush shouldn't have a say in whether or not the whole country should be against gay marriage. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't dictate how each state wants to run. Plus, he'll be out of office soon enough, so it doesn't matter what he decides. I think some things are better left up to the individual states, as they'll be the ones to live with the decision. Let's just leave it at that.",
            "So, no, I don't think they should do that at all. Let me explain why. Myspace, it's a public platform, right? If you look at the definition, it's basically for people to see whatever you post. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it. It could be school officials or anyone else. They might see something you didn't intend for them to see. But, if something on the internet could potentially prevent a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. It's the school officials' responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and this might help them do just that. Now, if they're just using the internet to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it for the greater good, to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all. I mean, if you're a student posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's crazy. Everything you post on the internet is for the world to see, and it can come back to bite you later. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. And if they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place, then it's fine. But if they're just doing it to catch students, that's not good. It's like they're dropping their kids off at school and expecting it to be a safe place, and the school officials are doing their duty to ensure that. That's why they do drills and practice for emergencies. They're just trying to make the school safer and prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's all I have to say.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. They have been grappling with a decline in followers, and I believe this is due to their lack of acceptance on numerous issues. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control can be quite rigid. I think if they were to evolve their thinking a bit, they might not face such a loss in their following.\n\nI've heard that many are starting to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these topics. People are no longer aligned with their stances on these issues, which is causing them to feel uncomfortable within the church. For example, if you support abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if you're for gay marriage, you might struggle in a following that doesn't agree with it.\n\nI don't understand why the Catholic Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. The church claims that priests are married to God, yet everyone else in the world has both a job and a family life. I'm not sure why priests can't have both as well.",
            "In my opinion, I’m not against gay marriage. I honestly don’t see it as a conscious choice that gay people make. It just seems like they are born that way, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. I don’t think it’s right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can’t. I haven’t given it much thought, but I would definitely say that’s wrong. It’s not like they have a say in how they are born. I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this. It’s not a legal or moral issue, and I don’t think they have a right to interfere in people’s lives. It’s just who they are, and they shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s all.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, and here’s why. There's really no solid reason to oppose it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's actually quite different. It’s like comparing two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, yet it's essentially the same thing. Let’s talk about the practical aspects. Many civil rights are tied to marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in a hospital or visit you because they're not technically family. That seems silly if you're spending your life with someone. Plus, scientific studies show that homosexual couples have the same relationship success rates and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main issue is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to marry in a church, they just want a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no religious involvement, it shouldn't be an issue. Some people, like Catholics, argue that it’s against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It’s like segregation: separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, like relationship roles played by partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, but again, the main concern is how children are treated. In New York City, for instance, children of gay parents have special schools because they face bullying in public schools. But parenting skills don't differ between gay and straight couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should be changed to reflect that.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, largely based on his religion, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of his reasons are moral, which vary from person to person. It’s unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It’s hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on an entire country, considering the recent controversy over \"under God” in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged. But the American Psychological Association says this is untrue. If we listened to institutions that do research and studies, society might see things differently.",
            "Let me start by sharing my experience working as a pharmacy intern over the summer. Now, it's important to note that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. I strongly believe that while we should not make it widely available to the public just yet, utilizing it for medicinal purposes is a different story. For instance, there are controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin that are often used in a clinical setting because they provide genuine benefits. Denying these benefits just because of marijuana's taboo status is not productive in my opinion.\n\nI must also emphasize that while marijuana and alcohol are both subject to abuse, marijuana is generally considered less harmful. Integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could be a viable solution. First, we should remove the stigma associated with marijuana to encourage responsible use. If we can achieve this, people might be better equipped to use marijuana responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, I contend that the benefits of marijuana should not be dismissed solely based on its illegal status. By embracing its medicinal properties and addressing the taboo surrounding it, we can pave the way for a more responsible and regulated future for marijuana.",
            "I believe the church has made adjustments to adapt to the twenty-first century. It isn't as rigid as it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends, but now, as I've aged, they've introduced a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer when you'll see folks in beach clothes, and families often arrive late. Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. The church I know has also seen a shift in its political landscape, but I'm not privy to the intricacies. Overall, I think it has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Married men can still become pedophiles due to their genetics, and it's not always a lifestyle choice. Many religions allow their clergy to marry, but if a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I believe pedophilia is primarily genetic rather than environmental, and marriage wouldn't change that. If the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, it's shameful, but I believe in many cases, they may not have been aware. I have no other significant thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but as we were still recovering from the September 11th attacks, everyone was quite shaken. The Bush administration used various pretexts to justify going into Iraq, claiming connections to Osama Bin Laden and linking the war to the attacks. They also alleged that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know were never proven true. This really grates on me, and the Iraq war has always made my blood boil.\n\nI believe the Bush administration straightforwardly lied to the American people and has not taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who gave a major presentation at the UN, later admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. They have shown complete disregard for the Constitution and have been trying to undermine it ever since, especially since September 11th. I think they entered office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t recall the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made this allegation in his book after being forced out, but it seems like the younger Bush was driven by a sense of blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. He also had long-term plans to expand our energy supply, which was quite underhanded. However, I believe the situation has dragged on long enough.\n\nIf we withdraw now, there’s a high risk of civil war and even more deaths. The alternative being considered by the UN and the US is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. However, I'm not sure this is a good idea in the long term because it will bring up issues of Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, as the news reports suggest the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister seems to lack control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting against less than a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in the Iraqi Parliament. The political process is quite tumultuous due to these radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this can be articulated in polite company.",
            "I guess I don't really know how I feel about the War in Iraq. I mean, it's like, what's the point? It wasn't even declared a war. It's more like a big get-back-at-Iraq thing, right? I mean, who do we think did 9/11? So, I don't really follow the details of it, but I know we're kind of just over there trying to build democracy and get oil. But it's not making anyone happy, and if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up again. It's so confusing! I mean, it's like, why are we still there? I don't know! I'm not really for the war, but I don't know if I'm against it either. It's hard to say. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it doesn't feel like one. We just have all these big guns and stuff to show we're powerful. But I don't think it's fair. It's like the Vietnam War, it was never declared, and now it's called a meaningless war. And I don't want Bush to be remembered as the worst president ever. It's just so unfair. And there are so many families with kids in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. But if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into something they're not. And that could make things worse. I mean, who knows what's going to happen in the end? It's just so hard to say. I guess it's going to go on for years.",
            "I strongly feel it's not appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to even consider it. I believe it's a matter that should be left to the churches, as the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any regulations over it would be a breach of what's already established in the constitution. I find it hypocritical for those who are pushing for its illegality to impose their beliefs on others, particularly when most Catholics and Christians oppose it. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of our constitution, promoting religious tolerance. I don't see why making an amendment about this issue would be necessary or beneficial, as it would only restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this at all. The president's push for this amendment is clearly driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it's not justified by any logical or economic reasons. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece on this topic.",
            "Ok, let's talk about the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to get started, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, they had very little to do with each other. The government used the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the terrorist attacks, to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nNow, I'm generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the government should have learned from the Vietnam War. The Iraq War was, in many ways, similar to Vietnam. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic government, just like they did in Vietnam. But they were not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and more importantly, they were not prepared for the insurgents who fought against them.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes. The war in Iraq has been going on for years, and many American troops have died. The U.S. is still there today, trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I don't think the government was prepared for it.\n\nThe U.S. government also made it seem like the invasion would be a short, successful mission, which was naïve. It's not an easy thing to implement a new form of government, especially after a long war. It took our own country a long time to become the powerful democracy it is today, with a lot of tension and civil war along the way.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to let him finish what he started, because it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping. But at the same time, we need to consider the staggering number of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the main reason is oil. The U.S. is getting its oil from Iraq, and it's usually all about money and controlling resources. Before the invasion, there were claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Yet, places like North Korea, which we know have these weapons, are not being attacked. I don't think the U.S. government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's been proven to have biological roots rather than sociological ones. This means that denying people the right to marry someone they love based on something they can't control is inhumane. I've always advocated for gay marriage and I believe that politics and government should stay out of people's personal lives. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who don't have the same rights as straight couples, but they function just like any other family. I think it's ridiculous for politicians to try and interpret marriage in a way that suits them. It's a personal matter, not a national or federal concern. I've heard from many sources that being homosexual can be influenced by biology, not upbringing. For example, a chemical reaction in the brain might predispose someone to be homosexual, rather than societal factors. It's unfair that two people can get married in secret without anyone knowing, but two gay people wanting to do the same gets front-page news. I believe marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal, and now it appears we're simply continuing the conflict to assert our status as a global superpower. Perhaps there were personal interests at play, like the previous feud between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While spreading democracy was a valid motivation, any hint of personal gain would have been unfair. I believe our initial goal was achieved in the first few months, as the war's start itself was a significant statement. Still, the prolonged conflict has left the original purpose diluted and misconceived, as it seems we're still at war for the sake of being at war, aiming for a decisive end that may never come.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on far too long. If our main objective was to install democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a just cause. However, I don't think our reasons have stayed true to this original intent. It seems we're still waging war just to wage war, without a clear end goal in sight. It's high time we let the local government take the reins and step back, as they will eventually have to handle their own affairs anyway. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, which could be better spent addressing our own pressing issues like poverty and infrastructure. It's a drain on our economy to keep funding a war that has lost its purpose over time.",
            "I wanted to clarify something. It seems that the situation you're referring to was prevented because someone went online and found some information. Anyway, I think it's okay. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much accessible to everyone. You have to understand that when you give someone access to your profile, you're allowing them to see it. So, if someone spotted something and prevented a situation, that's not an invasion of privacy. However, it might be difficult to monitor every profile to ensure safety, but it becomes discriminatory if they only target the \"bad kids.\" It depends on the context—whether they were actively searching for something specific or just stumbled upon it. I don't know, it's a tricky issue. I use Facebook, and I'm always aware that there are creepy people out there. I saw a TV show where a man easily found someone's information and convinced her to meet him. It's scary. Sometimes, people I don't recognize on my class list IM me, and I wonder if they know too much about me. It's a dangerous game balancing privacy and communication. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can see what. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seems a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or if they had the right to do that. It's a complex situation.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it\nNot only with women though\nI feel it has to do with the specific field of work that you’re engaged in\nUm\nI mean, for the most part, I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s this glass ceiling where, even though there’s supposed to be equality, many people struggle to work under a woman if they are a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, a lot of times in the workplace, women might see a job they’re qualified for\nBut the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd um\nI guess the same goes for men too\nAnd like other industries like fashion or\nUm being a parent at home\nIt’s really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male\nAnd um\nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you’re the male, you should be out working\nYou should be the money maker of your family\nWhy are you staying at home?\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them and maybe the wife has the better job\nAnd like it’s working out fine for them\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd then in the fashion industry\nUm\nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight\nI don’t know if that really makes sense\nBut I guess it’s because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nLike I guess have different lifestyles\nAnd so if you have the typical lifestyle and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry\nPeople will be like, well wait, how do I really know if you know anything about fashion if you’re a woman?\nLike you don’t really know what our case is like\nLike these other guys\nAnd so\nDepending on the field of work you’re in\nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds\nBut change is really slow so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process\nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works\nAnd um\nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nAnd so they do know what I’m talking about\nSo I guess you kind of have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, by not being too pushy\nBut um saying like the qualities of them\nBecause if you force it, people are going to resist\nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist\nAnd we’ve come a long way and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go on to become a CEO\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don’t know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "I understand that they didn’t outright legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means that getting caught with it is treated more like getting a traffic ticket than a criminal offense. While a decriminalized charge can still have serious future ramifications, such as making it difficult to pass a job interview, it does reduce the immediate consequences of being arrested and booked. On the other hand, there are costs involved in arresting, housing, and bringing individuals to court, especially in financially struggling communities. In a place like Denver, where the community tends to be more open-minded and liberal, decriminalizing marijuana might be a good decision. This could potentially free up funds for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. However, it's important to consider that widespread legalization could lead to marijuana being sold in gas stations and smoked in public, which might not be desirable. Additionally, while alcohol may have more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more enduring impact on an individual's lifestyle. I don't think that either substance should be generalized, as people react differently based on their personalities and behaviors.",
            "In my opinion, yes, there are some things that the Catholic Church has done traditionally that are quite old-fashioned. They've maintained these customs for long periods, which is good for grounding and maintaining traditions. However, it's also crucial to be open-minded to change. Many Catholics feel that they must attend Church weekly and adhere strictly to the Church's rules. This strictness sometimes makes it seem like the Church doesn't accept those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or aren't Catholic. For instance, my parents faced difficulties when it came to getting married in the Church because my father was an Episcopalian. This isn't really tolerant of other religions, which goes against the Church's teachings on loving others. I believe many Catholic doctrines tell us what to do, but the Church's practices don't always align with these teachings due to their outdated nature. I think it's a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't believe it would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. I think priests would act that way whether they're married or not, as the act involves children, not spouses. Therefore, I don't think allowing priests to marry would deter them from these behaviors. In my view, it wouldn't make a difference.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't declare one side as right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most complex topics we're dealing with today. The debate lies between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage, which is tricky without offending anyone. I think civil unions, regardless of the ceremony's religious context, should be treated equally by the government. After all, they're unions between two people, and the government shouldn't concern itself with the type of ceremony or religious significance. But if states can come to a logical consensus, they should push for federal recognition of civil unions. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd; it's not a cause large enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's simply not that important to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "You know, I was brought up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I've got a lot of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each state. I mean, there are so many democratic and republican states, and you can't deny that democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you're choosing to live there, so you should accept that state's position on the issue. I believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think the decision should be up to each state.\n\nI also think Bush shouldn't have a say in whether or not the whole country should be against gay marriage. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't dictate how each state wants to run. Plus, he'll be out of office soon enough, so it doesn't matter what he decides. I think some things are better left up to the individual states, as they'll be the ones to live with the decision. Let's just leave it at that.",
            "So, no, I don't think they should do that at all. Let me explain why. Myspace, it's a public platform, right? If you look at the definition, it's basically for people to see whatever you post. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it. It could be school officials or anyone else. They might see something you didn't intend for them to see. But, if something on the internet could potentially prevent a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. It's the school officials' responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and this might help them do just that. Now, if they're just using the internet to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it for the greater good, to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all. I mean, if you're a student posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's crazy. Everything you post on the internet is for the world to see, and it can come back to bite you later. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. And if they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place, then it's fine. But if they're just doing it to catch students, that's not good. It's like they're dropping their kids off at school and expecting it to be a safe place, and the school officials are doing their duty to ensure that. That's why they do drills and practice for emergencies. They're just trying to make the school safer and prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's all I have to say.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. They have been grappling with a decline in followers, and I believe this is due to their lack of acceptance on numerous issues. For instance, their stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control can be quite rigid. I think if they were to evolve their thinking a bit, they might not face such a loss in their following.\n\nI've heard that many are starting to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these topics. People are no longer aligned with their stances on these issues, which is causing them to feel uncomfortable within the church. For example, if you support abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a community where it's seen as completely wrong. Similarly, if you're for gay marriage, you might struggle in a following that doesn't agree with it.\n\nI don't understand why the Catholic Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. The church claims that priests are married to God, yet everyone else in the world has both a job and a family life. I'm not sure why priests can't have both as well.",
            "In my opinion, I’m not against gay marriage. I honestly don’t see it as a conscious choice that gay people make. It just seems like they are born that way, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible for their sexual orientation. I don’t think it’s right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can’t. I haven’t given it much thought, but I would definitely say that’s wrong. It’s not like they have a say in how they are born. I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, it doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this. It’s not a legal or moral issue, and I don’t think they have a right to interfere in people’s lives. It’s just who they are, and they shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s all.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized, and here’s why. There's really no solid reason to oppose it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but it's actually quite different. It’s like comparing two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, yet it's essentially the same thing. Let’s talk about the practical aspects. Many civil rights are tied to marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in a hospital or visit you because they're not technically family. That seems silly if you're spending your life with someone. Plus, scientific studies show that homosexual couples have the same relationship success rates and satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main issue is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to marry in a church, they just want a legal document provided by the government. If there’s no religious involvement, it shouldn't be an issue. Some people, like Catholics, argue that it’s against their religion and morally wrong, but in a legal sense, if you're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It’s like segregation: separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, like relationship roles played by partners. People worry about adoption and community issues, but again, the main concern is how children are treated. In New York City, for instance, children of gay parents have special schools because they face bullying in public schools. But parenting skills don't differ between gay and straight couples. The federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should be changed to reflect that.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, largely based on his religion, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of his reasons are moral, which vary from person to person. It’s unethical to embrace one group's morality while ignoring others. It’s hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on an entire country, considering the recent controversy over \"under God” in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged. But the American Psychological Association says this is untrue. If we listened to institutions that do research and studies, society might see things differently.",
            "Let me start by sharing my experience working as a pharmacy intern over the summer. Now, it's important to note that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. I strongly believe that while we should not make it widely available to the public just yet, utilizing it for medicinal purposes is a different story. For instance, there are controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin that are often used in a clinical setting because they provide genuine benefits. Denying these benefits just because of marijuana's taboo status is not productive in my opinion.\n\nI must also emphasize that while marijuana and alcohol are both subject to abuse, marijuana is generally considered less harmful. Integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could be a viable solution. First, we should remove the stigma associated with marijuana to encourage responsible use. If we can achieve this, people might be better equipped to use marijuana responsibly for both recreational and medicinal purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, I contend that the benefits of marijuana should not be dismissed solely based on its illegal status. By embracing its medicinal properties and addressing the taboo surrounding it, we can pave the way for a more responsible and regulated future for marijuana.",
            "I believe the church has made adjustments to adapt to the twenty-first century. It isn't as rigid as it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on weekends, but now, as I've aged, they've introduced a teen mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during summer when you'll see folks in beach clothes, and families often arrive late. Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis. The church I know has also seen a shift in its political landscape, but I'm not privy to the intricacies. Overall, I think it has become more casual.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Married men can still become pedophiles due to their genetics, and it's not always a lifestyle choice. Many religions allow their clergy to marry, but if a priest truly wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different faith. I believe pedophilia is primarily genetic rather than environmental, and marriage wouldn't change that. If the church knew about the abuse and covered it up, it's shameful, but I believe in many cases, they may not have been aware. I have no other significant thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but as we were still recovering from the September 11th attacks, everyone was quite shaken. The Bush administration used various pretexts to justify going into Iraq, claiming connections to Osama Bin Laden and linking the war to the attacks. They also alleged that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know were never proven true. This really grates on me, and the Iraq war has always made my blood boil.\n\nI believe the Bush administration straightforwardly lied to the American people and has not taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who gave a major presentation at the UN, later admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. They have shown complete disregard for the Constitution and have been trying to undermine it ever since, especially since September 11th. I think they entered office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t recall the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made this allegation in his book after being forced out, but it seems like the younger Bush was driven by a sense of blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. He also had long-term plans to expand our energy supply, which was quite underhanded. However, I believe the situation has dragged on long enough.\n\nIf we withdraw now, there’s a high risk of civil war and even more deaths. The alternative being considered by the UN and the US is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order. However, I'm not sure this is a good idea in the long term because it will bring up issues of Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, as the news reports suggest the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister seems to lack control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting against less than a year ago, now holds a significant number of seats in the Iraqi Parliament. The political process is quite tumultuous due to these radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of this can be articulated in polite company.",
            "I guess I don't really know how I feel about the War in Iraq. I mean, it's like, what's the point? It wasn't even declared a war. It's more like a big get-back-at-Iraq thing, right? I mean, who do we think did 9/11? So, I don't really follow the details of it, but I know we're kind of just over there trying to build democracy and get oil. But it's not making anyone happy, and if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, which takes forever. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up again. It's so confusing! I mean, it's like, why are we still there? I don't know! I'm not really for the war, but I don't know if I'm against it either. It's hard to say. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because it doesn't feel like one. We just have all these big guns and stuff to show we're powerful. But I don't think it's fair. It's like the Vietnam War, it was never declared, and now it's called a meaningless war. And I don't want Bush to be remembered as the worst president ever. It's just so unfair. And there are so many families with kids in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. But if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into something they're not. And that could make things worse. I mean, who knows what's going to happen in the end? It's just so hard to say. I guess it's going to go on for years.",
            "I strongly feel it's not appropriate for a state to legalize it or for the government to even consider it. I believe it's a matter that should be left to the churches, as the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any regulations over it would be a breach of what's already established in the constitution. I find it hypocritical for those who are pushing for its illegality to impose their beliefs on others, particularly when most Catholics and Christians oppose it. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of our constitution, promoting religious tolerance. I don't see why making an amendment about this issue would be necessary or beneficial, as it would only restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this at all. The president's push for this amendment is clearly driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, and it's not justified by any logical or economic reasons. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece on this topic.",
            "Ok, let's talk about the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to get started, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, they had very little to do with each other. The government used the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the terrorist attacks, to justify the invasion, which started in 2003.\n\nNow, I'm generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the government should have learned from the Vietnam War. The Iraq War was, in many ways, similar to Vietnam. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to implement a democratic government, just like they did in Vietnam. But they were not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and more importantly, they were not prepared for the insurgents who fought against them.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes. The war in Iraq has been going on for years, and many American troops have died. The U.S. is still there today, trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It's a long process, and I don't think the government was prepared for it.\n\nThe U.S. government also made it seem like the invasion would be a short, successful mission, which was naïve. It's not an easy thing to implement a new form of government, especially after a long war. It took our own country a long time to become the powerful democracy it is today, with a lot of tension and civil war along the way.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have voted for George Bush to let him finish what he started, because it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping. But at the same time, we need to consider the staggering number of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the main reason is oil. The U.S. is getting its oil from Iraq, and it's usually all about money and controlling resources. Before the invasion, there were claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Yet, places like North Korea, which we know have these weapons, are not being attacked. I don't think the U.S. government is being thorough or truthful enough in their decisions.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there soon, but probably not.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's been proven to have biological roots rather than sociological ones. This means that denying people the right to marry someone they love based on something they can't control is inhumane. I've always advocated for gay marriage and I believe that politics and government should stay out of people's personal lives. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who don't have the same rights as straight couples, but they function just like any other family. I think it's ridiculous for politicians to try and interpret marriage in a way that suits them. It's a personal matter, not a national or federal concern. I've heard from many sources that being homosexual can be influenced by biology, not upbringing. For example, a chemical reaction in the brain might predispose someone to be homosexual, rather than societal factors. It's unfair that two people can get married in secret without anyone knowing, but two gay people wanting to do the same gets front-page news. I believe marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",

            "I feel like the war has dragged on far too long. Initially, the purpose seemed noble: to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we've lost sight of that goal, and now it appears we're simply continuing the conflict to assert our status as a global superpower. Perhaps there were personal interests at play, like the previous feud between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While spreading democracy was a valid motivation, any hint of personal gain would have been unfair. I believe our initial goal was achieved in the first few months, as the war's start itself was a significant statement. Still, the prolonged conflict has left the original purpose diluted and misconceived, as it seems we're still at war for the sake of being at war, aiming for a decisive end that may never come.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on far too long. If our main objective was to install democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant, that would have been a just cause. However, I don't think our reasons have stayed true to this original intent. It seems we're still waging war just to wage war, without a clear end goal in sight. It's high time we let the local government take the reins and step back, as they will eventually have to handle their own affairs anyway. We've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, which could be better spent addressing our own pressing issues like poverty and infrastructure. It's a drain on our economy to keep funding a war that has lost its purpose over time.",
            "I wanted to clarify something. It seems that the situation you're referring to was prevented because someone went online and found some information. Anyway, I think it's okay. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it's pretty much accessible to everyone. You have to understand that when you give someone access to your profile, you're allowing them to see it. So, if someone spotted something and prevented a situation, that's not an invasion of privacy. However, it might be difficult to monitor every profile to ensure safety, but it becomes discriminatory if they only target the \"bad kids.\" It depends on the context—whether they were actively searching for something specific or just stumbled upon it. I don't know, it's a tricky issue. I use Facebook, and I'm always aware that there are creepy people out there. I saw a TV show where a man easily found someone's information and convinced her to meet him. It's scary. Sometimes, people I don't recognize on my class list IM me, and I wonder if they know too much about me. It's a dangerous game balancing privacy and communication. I only accept people I know, but you never know who can see what. My roommate mentioned that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seems a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or if they had the right to do that. It's a complex situation.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nUm\nAnd it\nNot only with women though\nI feel it has to do with the specific field of work that you’re engaged in\nUm\nI mean, for the most part, I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s this glass ceiling where, even though there’s supposed to be equality, many people struggle to work under a woman if they are a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, a lot of times in the workplace, women might see a job they’re qualified for\nBut the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd um\nI guess the same goes for men too\nAnd like other industries like fashion or\nUm being a parent at home\nIt’s really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male\nAnd um\nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, oh well, you’re the male, you should be out working\nYou should be the money maker of your family\nWhy are you staying at home?\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them and maybe the wife has the better job\nAnd like it’s working out fine for them\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd then in the fashion industry\nUm\nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight\nI don’t know if that really makes sense\nBut I guess it’s because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nLike I guess have different lifestyles\nAnd so if you have the typical lifestyle and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry\nPeople will be like, well wait, how do I really know if you know anything about fashion if you’re a woman?\nLike you don’t really know what our case is like\nLike these other guys\nAnd so\nDepending on the field of work you’re in\nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds\nBut change is really slow so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process\nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads\nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works\nAnd um\nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nAnd so they do know what I’m talking about\nSo I guess you kind of have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against, by not being too pushy\nBut um saying like the qualities of them\nBecause if you force it, people are going to resist\nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist\nAnd we’ve come a long way and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go on to become a CEO\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don’t know\nI guess that’d be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "I understand that they didn’t outright legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means that getting caught with it is treated more like getting a traffic ticket than a criminal offense. While a decriminalized charge can still have serious future ramifications, such as making it difficult to pass a job interview, it does reduce the immediate consequences of being arrested and booked. On the other hand, there are costs involved in arresting, housing, and bringing individuals to court, especially in financially struggling communities. In a place like Denver, where the community tends to be more open-minded and liberal, decriminalizing marijuana might be a good decision. This could potentially free up funds for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. However, it's important to consider that widespread legalization could lead to marijuana being sold in gas stations and smoked in public, which might not be desirable. Additionally, while alcohol may have more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana often has a more enduring impact on an individual's lifestyle. I don't think that either substance should be generalized, as people react differently based on their personalities and behaviors.",
            "In my opinion, yes, there are some things that the Catholic Church has done traditionally that are quite old-fashioned. They've maintained these customs for long periods, which is good for grounding and maintaining traditions. However, it's also crucial to be open-minded to change. Many Catholics feel that they must attend Church weekly and adhere strictly to the Church's rules. This strictness sometimes makes it seem like the Church doesn't accept those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly or aren't Catholic. For instance, my parents faced difficulties when it came to getting married in the Church because my father was an Episcopalian. This isn't really tolerant of other religions, which goes against the Church's teachings on loving others. I believe many Catholic doctrines tell us what to do, but the Church's practices don't always align with these teachings due to their outdated nature. I think it's a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don't believe it would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. I think priests would act that way whether they're married or not, as the act involves children, not spouses. Therefore, I don't think allowing priests to marry would deter them from these behaviors. In my view, it wouldn't make a difference.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't declare one side as right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most complex topics we're dealing with today. The debate lies between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage, which is tricky without offending anyone. I think civil unions, regardless of the ceremony's religious context, should be treated equally by the government. After all, they're unions between two people, and the government shouldn't concern itself with the type of ceremony or religious significance. But if states can come to a logical consensus, they should push for federal recognition of civil unions. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd; it's not a cause large enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's simply not that important to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "You know, I was brought up in a Christian household, so my views on homosexuality are a bit nuanced. I've got a lot of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each state. I mean, there are so many democratic and republican states, and you can't deny that democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you're choosing to live there, so you should accept that state's position on the issue. I believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think the decision should be up to each state.\n\nI also think Bush shouldn't have a say in whether or not the whole country should be against gay marriage. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't dictate how each state wants to run. Plus, he'll be out of office soon enough, so it doesn't matter what he decides. I think some things are better left up to the individual states, as they'll be the ones to live with the decision. Let's just leave it at that.",
            "So, no, I don't think they should do that at all. Let me explain why. Myspace, it's a public platform, right? If you look at the definition, it's basically for people to see whatever you post. Now, if you post something on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it. It could be school officials or anyone else. They might see something you didn't intend for them to see. But, if something on the internet could potentially prevent a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. It's the school officials' responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and this might help them do just that. Now, if they're just using the internet to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it for the greater good, to make the school safer, then I don't think it's an invasion at all. I mean, if you're a student posting something on Myspace and you don't expect to get in trouble, that's crazy. Everything you post on the internet is for the world to see, and it can come back to bite you later. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. And if they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place, then it's fine. But if they're just doing it to catch students, that's not good. It's like they're dropping their kids off at school and expecting it to be a safe place, and the school officials are doing their duty to ensure that. That's why they do drills and practice for emergencies. They're just trying to make the school safer and prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's all I have to say.",
