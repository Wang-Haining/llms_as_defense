            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so I think the Catholic Church needs to evolve a bit, you know? Like, I hear they're losing followers, and I think it might be because some of their views are, well, a little stuck in the past.  \n\nTake gay marriage, abortion, birth control – these are hot button issues, and the Church's stance on them is pretty strong.  Now, they have the right to their beliefs, but maybe if they opened their minds a little, they wouldn't be losing so many people.  \n\nI hear folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with how they handle these things.  It's like, if the Church says abortion is wrong and you believe it's okay, you might not feel comfortable being part of that group. Same with gay marriage – if that's something you support, you might not want to belong to a place that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married.  It's not like those things would magically solve all their problems, but maybe it would help.  Like, maybe if priests had families, they wouldn't be so quick to, you know, *do those things*.  I mean, it's hard to say for sure, right?",
            "So, like, gay marriage, huh? Well, I ain't sayin' it's wrong, you know? I dunno, maybe it's somethin' you're just born with, like, not a choice, ya dig? Like, I was born straight, and some folks are born gay, right?  Seems kinda unfair to hold 'em responsible for somethin' they weren't choosin',  y'know?\n\nIt just seems messed up to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two ladies can't.  Haven't really thought too hard about it, but it feels wrong,  ya know?\n\nIt's like, they don't get to pick who they're attracted to,  it's just how they are.  I mean, shouldn't we be cool with that? Shouldn't the government stay outta people's love lives?  It ain't like it's threatenin' national security or nothin'. Seems kinda private, y'know?\n\nIt's like, why put 'em on a stage and make 'em feel bad for  who they are? Like they made a wrong choice or somethin'.  Nah, man, that ain't right.  Let 'em live their lives,  love who they love,  it's not hurtin' nobody.",
            "So, I'm all for gay marriage, ya know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are gonna mess up straight families, but come on! It's just not the same thing.  It's like two sides of the same coin – different, but still connected.  \n\nThere's a whole bunch of rights that come with marriage, like property and healthcare. Think about it, if your partner's gay, they can't even visit you in the hospital! It's crazy, right? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and healthy as straight ones.  They've got the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat bugs me is that folks get hung up on the religious angle.  Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church – they just want a legal document, something the government issues.  If the government isn't involved in religion, why should it matter?\n\nIt's like segregation – separating people based on who they are isn't fair. Gay couples are just like straight couples – they have the same roles, the same dynamics.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and kids. Will they be okay? But the truth is, parenting skills are the same, whether you're gay or straight.  It's about love and care, not orientation.  Plus, some kids of gay parents face bullying in schools. It's heartbreaking, and it shouldn't be happening.\n\nLook, I think the government needs to step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about equality and treating everyone fairly.  President Bush seems to have strong religious views that get in the way, but morality is subjective! It's not something the government should be dictating.  \n\nSome folks think being gay is a psychological problem, but the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. We need to listen to experts and evidence, not just rumors and prejudice.",
            "Alright, so listen up, I work in a hospital pharmacy, you know?  See, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's all bad. Like,  I think making drugs available to everyone is a big no-no, but for medical uses?  Totally a yes. Cause come on, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good uses, right? It's not like it's inherently bad.  \n\nI mean, think about it,  we pharmacies use all kinds of crazy drugs that are totally illegal, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, all that jazz. They're controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why not give marijuana the same chance, ya know? \n\nPeople get all hung up on it being taboo, but it ain't like alcohol. Sure, alcohol can be bad too, but weed, if you mess with it too much, it's not gonna kill ya like some hard stuff. It's a tricky thing, I guess. Maybe we should legalize it little by little, not all at once, so folks don't go crazy. But first, we gotta ditch that whole scary \"Reefer Madness\" vibe, ya know? \n\nPeople freak out about marijuana 'cause it's illegal, but honestly, it ain't as bad as heroin or cocaine.  If we stop picturing it as this evil drug, maybe people will use it responsibly. And for medical stuff?  Definitely.",
            "So, I think the church has totally changed with the times, you know? It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was a kid, every Sunday was a big deal - cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too. We'd go to church every week, but now things are different. \n\nThey've got this teen mass thing, which is only like thirty minutes long. People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. I've seen people show up straight from the beach! And even at the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, people are rocking jeans and khakis now.  \n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. As for all the other stuff, like the scandals with priests, well, I don't really know about all that political stuff. But yeah, the church seems a lot more laid-back these days.",
            "(laughs)\n\nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, the whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil. At first, I was kinda okay with the idea, but then 9/11 happened, and everything changed. It felt like we rushed into this war, using 9/11 as a smokescreen.\n\nThey kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but that's all been proven false. The Bush administration straight up lied to us, and they haven't even admitted it! It's like they don't even care about the Constitution.\n\nI mean, even Colin Powell, remember that big speech he gave at the UN? Now he says he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong. That's a crime, plain and simple.\n\nIt feels like they came into office wanting to go to war, and they twisted everything to make it happen. I heard this one guy, a former Treasury Secretary, said they were practically itching for a fight. And don't even get me started on the whole oil thing – using a war to control resources? So shady.\n\nIt's been going on for way too long. Pulling out now would be messy, though, probably cause a civil war and more deaths. But sending in Syria and Saudi Arabia to \"fix\" things? That doesn't feel right either. It's like they're just going to keep meddling in Iraq's affairs, and that's not good for anyone.\n\nAnd the Iraqi government? What a mess! Parliament's useless, the Prime Minister has no real power, and these radical groups are running wild. It's like a powder keg waiting to explode.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq?  Man, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, you know?  I mean, it wasn't even a real war, officially. It just felt like a \"get back at Iraq\" thing, like they were the ones behind 9/11. \n\nHonestly, I'm not really into politics or keeping up with all the details. But it seems like we're still there trying to build a democracy, like we want Iraq to become another USA. And, let's be real, oil is a big part of it too. \n\nThe thing is, it's making everyone mad.  We can't just force democracy on them overnight. It takes time, and if we leave before it's set, they'll be even more messed up.  It's a real catch-22.\n\nSee, I'm not good with tough topics like this. It's so complicated! \n\nBut I guess I feel like we should stay, help them out, but it's a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, kind of like how Vietnam is still seen as a bad thing.\n\nOn the other hand, I know there are families with loved ones in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. \n\nIt's a mess! They have their own culture, and we're trying to force ours on them. It just feels like it's making things worse, stirring up more hatred.\n\nI think this war will drag on forever, and nobody wins in the end. It's a real bummer.",
            "Ugh, I just can't see how legalizing it is right. It feels wrong, like the government overstepping its bounds. The Constitution, man, it's crystal clear about separating church and state. They're trying to force their beliefs on everyone, picking and choosing which churches get to decide what's right and wrong. It's like saying Catholics get to rule the roost on this one, even though most of them are against it.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is what makes this country great, you know? It lets everyone practice their faith freely.  Trying to change that with an amendment feels like going against everything the Constitution stands for. Plus, wouldn't it be the first amendment ever meant to restrict people instead of the government?  \n\nThis whole thing just feels off. The government shouldn't be telling churches what they can and can't do. It should be up to them, not some politician pushing his own beliefs, especially when they go against the grain of what the Constitution already says.  \n\nI just don't see how it impacts the economy or anything else. Maybe even a positive vibe, who knows? It's all about personal choice, not government interference.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  Let me tell ya, I don't think the government straight up told the American people the whole truth about why we went in there. They tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, but honestly, those two things weren't really connected. The government played on people's emotions, you know? They were angry after 9/11, and they used that anger to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam – another mistake the government should've learned from.  Tons of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and just ripped out Iraq's government without a solid plan for what would happen next. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt. Now we're stuck there trying to put in a democracy, which is a tough job, even in a country that's ready for it.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – trying to push out communism and force democracy on a people who weren't ready for it. It wasn't a clear victory, more like a long, painful loss. You can't just win hearts and minds by force.  Even if some people support you, there are always going to be insurgents fighting back. It's impossible to fight a whole nation.\n\nThe government should've known this going in.  They should've planned for all the possibilities.  They made it seem like this would be a quick, clean win, but it's been dragging on forever.  We're still there in 2006, American troops are still dying, and the Iraqi government is still struggling to hold together.\n\nIt's a tough situation.  I mean, we can't just leave them now after all the chaos we've unleashed. But how long can we keep putting our own people at risk for a country that might never be truly free?\n\nAnd then there's the whole oil thing. Are we really fighting this war for democracy, or are we fighting for access to their resources? We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, and we didn't do anything about it. It's all about money and control, isn't it?",
            "So, you know, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I really think it's a personal preference, something that science is showing is more likely biological than anything else.  To take away someone's rights because of something they can't control, something that's part of who they are, feels just plain wrong to me. It's like, inhuman, you know? I've always been a supporter of gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. This is a personal thing, a family thing. It's not something the state should be dictating. At home, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of gay couples who are together, but can't get married because the law won't let them. They live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go to work, they're part of the community. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. It's people's lives, their love, their commitment.  \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how studies are showing that there's a biological basis for being gay, something that's in your brain chemistry. It's like you're born that way, not something you choose. It's not about how you were raised or your environment. \n\nBesides the obvious,  it just feels… yeah, like it's a private matter. A guy and a girl can marry without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to get married, it's a huge deal. It's like they're making a public spectacle out of it when it should just be a personal celebration.  It should be kept in the private realm, not splashed all over the news.",
            "Alright, listen up. When you chuck something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. It's public, plain and simple. \n\nBeing an RA, I've seen this firsthand.  Whatever you put online, it sticks. People will judge you based on it. If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shooting things, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss these things out there. The internet's a wild beast; everyone's got a peek. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, you get their updates.\n\nNow, the school probably didn't get an official warning from Myspace. Someone saw something, got worried, and told the school. They had to act, you know?  Imagine if something bad happened, and they could have stopped it?  \n\nBut, here's the catch - sometimes people mess around, right? They joke around, and it can get misinterpreted. Like, maybe it was just a crazed sociology project gone wrong. Or maybe, just maybe, it was something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone heard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked through the kid's Facebook, and found some stuff that, in light of the situation, was pretty darn scary. It might have been a joke, but it looked bad.\n\nThe thing is, once you put something online, there's no privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it! Don't expect to control what people think.\n\nNow, I'm not saying school officials should be stalking their students on Facebook. That's creepy! But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously. \n\nI mean, I don't think they should be snooping through texts or IMs unless they have a good reason. But if something's brought up, they have to investigate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.",
            "Right, so I feel like this whole war has dragged on for far too long.  At the start, I get it, there was a good reason, right?  Helping another country get its democracy going.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just in it because we have to be, like we're trying to prove we're the big dogs.  Plus, the whole thing started because of, you know, whatever issues Bush Sr. had with Saddam back in the day. So maybe the reasons we started this weren't so pure to begin with.\n\nIf the goal was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have one, that's a good thing, a righteous thing. But I don't think that's what's happening anymore. It's like we've lost our way, and now it's all about winning, about not backing down, even though it's been going on for years.\n\nListen, maybe in those first few months, dropping that bombshell made a statement, but come on, it's been way too long.  Their government, their people, they have to figure things out on their own eventually. We can't keep throwing money and lives into this thing forever.\n\nThink about it: we're spending billions and billions, money that could be helping people here at home.  We have our own problems, poverty, things we need to fix, but instead, we're pouring it all into this war that doesn't even have a clear purpose anymore.\n\nWe need to stop. We need to bring our troops home. There comes a point where you just have to say enough is enough. We can't keep bleeding money and lives for a war we've already lost.",
            "So, lemme ask,  you know, there was this thing, right?  Seems like someone saw somethin' online, like on Myspace, and it, like, stopped some bad stuff from happening. I get that it's kind of a bummer, ya know, people lookin' at your stuff without permission. But isn't Myspace kinda public, like, if you put it out there, it's kinda fair game?\n\nI mean, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you chose to be their friend, right?  So it's kinda like givin' them the okay to see that stuff.\n\nIt's like, anything you put online, you gotta expect that some folks might see it.\n\nI guess if someone saw somethin' that could've saved someone's life, that's a good thing, right?\n\nBut,  uh, it's tough, right?  I mean, you can't have someone watchin' everyone's Myspace all day, lookin' for trouble.\n\nThat'd be like, pickin' on the \"bad kids\" or somethin'.\n\nI don't know, maybe it depends on the situation.\n\nLike, were they lookin' for somethin' specific, or just snoopin'?\n\nI don't know, it's a sticky wicket.\n\nMe, I don't have Myspace, but I got Facebook.\n\nIt freaks me out a little thinkin' about creeps out there seein' my stuff.\n\nI saw this thing on TV once, about this dude who could find people's info real fast, like, got their screen name and started talkin' to 'em on IM in like, less than a minute, and got 'em to meet up.\n\nI wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes IM'in me, and they know it's me, even though I don't recognize their names.\n\nIt's creepy, 'cause they know all about you, your classes, your friends, your photos. \n\nI try to keep it clean, but it's hard, 'cause Facebook is supposed to be for connectin' with friends.\n\nSo, it's a double-edged sword, ya know?\n\nYou put stuff out there, you gotta expect some folks might see it.\n\n I heard my roommate talkin' about her high school, they banned Myspace.\n\nThat's kinda weird, right? How can they tell you what you can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing makes me want to pull my hair out.  It feels hypocritical even talking about it, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start.  I mean, I was, but honestly, does it even matter now?  It's like everyone knows it was a bad idea except for those in charge who just can't admit they messed up. \n\nYou look at the polls, it's insane.  Everywhere you look, seventy-five to eighty percent of people think it was a disaster – Iraqis, Americans, even the troops over there.  They want out!  And who can blame them?  It's been a train wreck from day one, and pulling out is just gonna be another dumpster fire.  The Middle East is a tangled mess, and our culture just clashes so badly with theirs.  It's like these politicians think they can just force democracy on them, but it's not that simple.  It's their culture, their way of life, and it's not like they asked for our help.\n\nSure, Saddam was a jerk, no question.  But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country, and this was just a recipe for disaster.  It's like quicksand, the deeper we get, the harder it is to get out.  \n\nHonestly, I don't even know what to say anymore.  I can't see any reason to stay there, and I haven't heard a single good reason from the administration.  Maybe a slow pullout over a year or so wouldn't be so bad, but just leaving now?  I think the people of Iraq deserve a say in this, and if they want us gone, maybe we should listen.  At least then we can wash our hands of it and say, \"We gave you the chance, but you chose to go your own way.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do.  But at least this way we'd be less of a problem.",
            "Ya know what? I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women. It's more like, depending on the field you're in, you know? Like for women, there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  \n\nMen sometimes have a hard time taking orders from a woman, just because of how things have always been. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't promote her because, well, history tells them women aren't supposed to be in charge. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other areas. Think about stay-at-home dads. It's super rare for a guy to be the one at home with the kids. People often judge them, thinking, \"Shouldn't the man be out earning money?\"  It can be tough on them when their dream is to raise their kids and their wife has the better job, even if it all works out great for their family. Society just doesn't get it. \n\nAnd in fashion? Guys can get overlooked if they're straight. Not sure if that makes sense, but people might think, \"How can a guy *really* understand fashion if he's not a woman?\" It's like, \"Oh, you're not like the other guys, so you must not know what you're talking about.\"\n\nSo yeah, depending on what you do, there's definitely gender discrimination.  Changing it is slow, though. We've come a long way from the 1800s for sure, but people have set ways of thinking.  Slowly, women are climbing the corporate ladder, becoming CEOs, and being accepted in business.  More men are becoming stay-at-home dads, and people are starting to see that it can work.  \n\nI think it's all about showing the good qualities of those who are stereotyped.  If you push too hard, people resist. We're finding a balance, but change takes time.",
            "So, get this, they didn't exactly legalize it, more like took the handcuffs off, y'know? Demystified it, turned it from a full-blown criminal offense to, like, a parking ticket.  You get a slap on the wrist instead of being thrown in the slammer. But here's the kicker, man, even with this decriminalization thing, the fear of a drug charge still lingers. Job interviews, background checks, all that jazz. It's a shadow that follows you, even if you're not facing jail time.  \n\nIt's crazy, right?  Think about it, the system spends a fortune locking people up for weed.  Courts, lawyers, housing, the whole nine yards. Where's that money going? Could it be going towards, you know, helping people instead of punishing them?  \n\nSeems like cities struggling financially could really use that cash. But then again, some places are just dead set against marijuana, no matter what. It's like a principle thing.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, I think it's a win-win. More money for schools, social programs, helping those in need.  It's a step in the right direction. \n\nBut let's be real, we don't want weed everywhere, blowing up like cigarettes in gas stations. There are valid concerns about that. It's still a bit taboo in many circles. Imagine the awkwardness, right? \n\nAnd alcohol, that's a different beast.  It messes with your motor skills more directly.  But marijuana, it can mess with your life in other ways, your choices, your priorities.  \n\nIt's a double-edged sword, man.  It affects everyone differently. Some people are responsible, some go overboard. It's hard to say for sure what the right answer is.",
            "I reckon I'd say yes, mostly because a lot of their traditions are pretty solid, like they've been doing the same stuff for ages. That's cool, you know, having roots. But it's also gotta be alright to change with the times, right? \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know feel this pressure to go to church every week, and there's a real strictness around how things are done. It's like they judge folks who don't follow every single rule perfectly. They don't seem too keen on folks who aren't, like, totally Catholic either, you know? And they don't really roll out the welcome mat for people from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Talk about not being open-minded, right?  We were always taught to love everyone, which is a big Catholic thing. But it feels kinda bogus when they preach that and then don't even accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like, the rules say one thing, but the way things are actually done is totally different. It's all so stuck in the past, and they just cling to it even though it seems kinda outdated.  \n\nNow, I think letting priests get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from, you know, doing the bad stuff. It's a whole 'nother level, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they probably gonna hurt kids regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about something messed up inside them, not about being single.  So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop that from happening.\n\nNope.",
            "Ugh, man, this whole thing is a real head-scratcher. I'm not sure where I stand on it yet, you know? It's tough to say if either side is totally right or wrong. This feels like the biggest, most tangled mess we're dealing with right now. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage even means.  It's a real minefield, trying to talk about this without stepping on anyone's toes.\n\nI dunno, maybe... maybe all civil unions are the way to go.  Should the government even be in charge of defining marriage, anyway?  It's like a sacrament, right? People don't get special tax breaks or anything from the government just for being baptized. So, if you're married, maybe the government should just see it as a civil union - two people, that's all it is. No need to get into the whole church and state thing, just recognize that two people are together.\n\nAnd with gay marriage...  I mean, it's just like any other civil union, right? Two people, love, commitment. If all the states could agree on that, maybe it should just become federal law.\n\nBut trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's insane! The Constitution shouldn't be messed with just because some people feel strongly about something. It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but not big enough to change the foundation of our country. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nNope, not worth it.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I've got tons of gay friends, you know? It's not something I totally agree with, but I believe everyone should have the right to marry who they love. It shouldn't be a national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves.\n\n  Like, you've got your blue states and your red states, right?  Blue states tend to be more open to gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, well, that's how they feel about it. It's their call. You kinda knew what you were getting into when you moved there.\n\n It's all about equal opportunity for everyone. Homosexuals deserve the same chances as anyone else, so legalizing it on a state-by-state basis seems fair.\n\n Honestly, I don't think the president should have the power to ban gay marriage across the whole country. It's up to the states to decide what's best for their own people. \n\nLook, Bush is leaving office soon anyway. What happens then? If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth forever. Let each state figure it out for themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, like, Myspace is a public thing, right? It's like a bulletin board where everyone can see what you post. If you put something on there, you gotta know that people will see it - teachers, parents, even the principal.\n\nSo, if the school sees something on Myspace that worries them, like talk about a potential shooting, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could easily find it from home. \n\nI get that it's creepy for them to snoop, especially if they're just looking for reasons to punish kids for drinking or smoking. But if they're trying to prevent something really bad, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay. Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, right?\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't write something bad about someone in an email if you didn't want them to see it, right? Because once something is online, it's out there forever.  \n\nIt's scary to think that something you post online could come back to bite you later, like when you're an adult. People can find old stuff from your Myspace days, even if you thought you deleted it. \n\nSo, yeah, I think it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, it's a invasion of privacy. On the other hand, they're trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Alright, so, the war... man.  At first, I was all in, you know?  Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I wanted payback.  I was ready to cause some serious chaos, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were fueled by emotion.  We didn't really think things through, went in unprepared, without a plan.  And it blew up in our faces.  I mean, I was for it then, but now?  I'm completely against it.\n\nI don't think it accomplished anything.  Those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  If they can't even get along, how are we supposed to help?  Frankly, Nine Eleven kinda made me lose all care about what happens over there.\n\nThey're just... different, you know?  They fight like savages, and I don't think they're really aiming to improve their country. They just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's best.  We should just pack up and leave.  We were just hyped up, driven by revenge.  Bush felt the pressure, the people wanted action.  And yeah, I get it, declaring war on Iraq seemed like the only option after what happened.\n\nBut we needed a better plan.  We didn't know what we were facing, and war over there is different.  We lacked unity, no clear goals, and it just spiraled out of control.  We went in driven by anger, and that's what we created over there.  I don't think we're capable of changing them. They're always going to be like that.\n\nI've said enough.  It's gone on long enough.  Sure, we've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just collapse once we leave, and we can't stay forever.  We're hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so I think the Catholic Church needs to evolve a bit, you know? Like, I hear they're losing followers, and I think it might be because some of their views are, well, a little stuck in the past.  \n\nTake gay marriage, abortion, birth control – these are hot button issues, and the Church's stance on them is pretty strong.  Now, they have the right to their beliefs, but maybe if they opened their minds a little, they wouldn't be losing so many people.  \n\nI hear folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with how they handle these things.  It's like, if the Church says abortion is wrong and you believe it's okay, you might not feel comfortable being part of that group. Same with gay marriage – if that's something you support, you might not want to belong to a place that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married.  It's not like those things would magically solve all their problems, but maybe it would help.  Like, maybe if priests had families, they wouldn't be so quick to, you know, *do those things*.  I mean, it's hard to say for sure, right?",
            "So, like, gay marriage, huh? Well, I ain't sayin' it's wrong, you know? I dunno, maybe it's somethin' you're just born with, like, not a choice, ya dig? Like, I was born straight, and some folks are born gay, right?  Seems kinda unfair to hold 'em responsible for somethin' they weren't choosin',  y'know?\n\nIt just seems messed up to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two ladies can't.  Haven't really thought too hard about it, but it feels wrong,  ya know?\n\nIt's like, they don't get to pick who they're attracted to,  it's just how they are.  I mean, shouldn't we be cool with that? Shouldn't the government stay outta people's love lives?  It ain't like it's threatenin' national security or nothin'. Seems kinda private, y'know?\n\nIt's like, why put 'em on a stage and make 'em feel bad for  who they are? Like they made a wrong choice or somethin'.  Nah, man, that ain't right.  Let 'em live their lives,  love who they love,  it's not hurtin' nobody.",
            "So, I'm all for gay marriage, ya know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are gonna mess up straight families, but come on! It's just not the same thing.  It's like two sides of the same coin – different, but still connected.  \n\nThere's a whole bunch of rights that come with marriage, like property and healthcare. Think about it, if your partner's gay, they can't even visit you in the hospital! It's crazy, right? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and healthy as straight ones.  They've got the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat bugs me is that folks get hung up on the religious angle.  Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church – they just want a legal document, something the government issues.  If the government isn't involved in religion, why should it matter?\n\nIt's like segregation – separating people based on who they are isn't fair. Gay couples are just like straight couples – they have the same roles, the same dynamics.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and kids. Will they be okay? But the truth is, parenting skills are the same, whether you're gay or straight.  It's about love and care, not orientation.  Plus, some kids of gay parents face bullying in schools. It's heartbreaking, and it shouldn't be happening.\n\nLook, I think the government needs to step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about equality and treating everyone fairly.  President Bush seems to have strong religious views that get in the way, but morality is subjective! It's not something the government should be dictating.  \n\nSome folks think being gay is a psychological problem, but the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. We need to listen to experts and evidence, not just rumors and prejudice.",
            "Alright, so listen up, I work in a hospital pharmacy, you know?  See, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's all bad. Like,  I think making drugs available to everyone is a big no-no, but for medical uses?  Totally a yes. Cause come on, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good uses, right? It's not like it's inherently bad.  \n\nI mean, think about it,  we pharmacies use all kinds of crazy drugs that are totally illegal, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, all that jazz. They're controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why not give marijuana the same chance, ya know? \n\nPeople get all hung up on it being taboo, but it ain't like alcohol. Sure, alcohol can be bad too, but weed, if you mess with it too much, it's not gonna kill ya like some hard stuff. It's a tricky thing, I guess. Maybe we should legalize it little by little, not all at once, so folks don't go crazy. But first, we gotta ditch that whole scary \"Reefer Madness\" vibe, ya know? \n\nPeople freak out about marijuana 'cause it's illegal, but honestly, it ain't as bad as heroin or cocaine.  If we stop picturing it as this evil drug, maybe people will use it responsibly. And for medical stuff?  Definitely.",
            "So, I think the church has totally changed with the times, you know? It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was a kid, every Sunday was a big deal - cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too. We'd go to church every week, but now things are different. \n\nThey've got this teen mass thing, which is only like thirty minutes long. People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. I've seen people show up straight from the beach! And even at the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, people are rocking jeans and khakis now.  \n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. As for all the other stuff, like the scandals with priests, well, I don't really know about all that political stuff. But yeah, the church seems a lot more laid-back these days.",
            "(laughs)\n\nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, the whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil. At first, I was kinda okay with the idea, but then 9/11 happened, and everything changed. It felt like we rushed into this war, using 9/11 as a smokescreen.\n\nThey kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but that's all been proven false. The Bush administration straight up lied to us, and they haven't even admitted it! It's like they don't even care about the Constitution.\n\nI mean, even Colin Powell, remember that big speech he gave at the UN? Now he says he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong. That's a crime, plain and simple.\n\nIt feels like they came into office wanting to go to war, and they twisted everything to make it happen. I heard this one guy, a former Treasury Secretary, said they were practically itching for a fight. And don't even get me started on the whole oil thing – using a war to control resources? So shady.\n\nIt's been going on for way too long. Pulling out now would be messy, though, probably cause a civil war and more deaths. But sending in Syria and Saudi Arabia to \"fix\" things? That doesn't feel right either. It's like they're just going to keep meddling in Iraq's affairs, and that's not good for anyone.\n\nAnd the Iraqi government? What a mess! Parliament's useless, the Prime Minister has no real power, and these radical groups are running wild. It's like a powder keg waiting to explode.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq?  Man, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, you know?  I mean, it wasn't even a real war, officially. It just felt like a \"get back at Iraq\" thing, like they were the ones behind 9/11. \n\nHonestly, I'm not really into politics or keeping up with all the details. But it seems like we're still there trying to build a democracy, like we want Iraq to become another USA. And, let's be real, oil is a big part of it too. \n\nThe thing is, it's making everyone mad.  We can't just force democracy on them overnight. It takes time, and if we leave before it's set, they'll be even more messed up.  It's a real catch-22.\n\nSee, I'm not good with tough topics like this. It's so complicated! \n\nBut I guess I feel like we should stay, help them out, but it's a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, kind of like how Vietnam is still seen as a bad thing.\n\nOn the other hand, I know there are families with loved ones in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. \n\nIt's a mess! They have their own culture, and we're trying to force ours on them. It just feels like it's making things worse, stirring up more hatred.\n\nI think this war will drag on forever, and nobody wins in the end. It's a real bummer.",
            "Ugh, I just can't see how legalizing it is right. It feels wrong, like the government overstepping its bounds. The Constitution, man, it's crystal clear about separating church and state. They're trying to force their beliefs on everyone, picking and choosing which churches get to decide what's right and wrong. It's like saying Catholics get to rule the roost on this one, even though most of them are against it.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is what makes this country great, you know? It lets everyone practice their faith freely.  Trying to change that with an amendment feels like going against everything the Constitution stands for. Plus, wouldn't it be the first amendment ever meant to restrict people instead of the government?  \n\nThis whole thing just feels off. The government shouldn't be telling churches what they can and can't do. It should be up to them, not some politician pushing his own beliefs, especially when they go against the grain of what the Constitution already says.  \n\nI just don't see how it impacts the economy or anything else. Maybe even a positive vibe, who knows? It's all about personal choice, not government interference.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  Let me tell ya, I don't think the government straight up told the American people the whole truth about why we went in there. They tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, but honestly, those two things weren't really connected. The government played on people's emotions, you know? They were angry after 9/11, and they used that anger to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam – another mistake the government should've learned from.  Tons of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and just ripped out Iraq's government without a solid plan for what would happen next. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt. Now we're stuck there trying to put in a democracy, which is a tough job, even in a country that's ready for it.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – trying to push out communism and force democracy on a people who weren't ready for it. It wasn't a clear victory, more like a long, painful loss. You can't just win hearts and minds by force.  Even if some people support you, there are always going to be insurgents fighting back. It's impossible to fight a whole nation.\n\nThe government should've known this going in.  They should've planned for all the possibilities.  They made it seem like this would be a quick, clean win, but it's been dragging on forever.  We're still there in 2006, American troops are still dying, and the Iraqi government is still struggling to hold together.\n\nIt's a tough situation.  I mean, we can't just leave them now after all the chaos we've unleashed. But how long can we keep putting our own people at risk for a country that might never be truly free?\n\nAnd then there's the whole oil thing. Are we really fighting this war for democracy, or are we fighting for access to their resources? We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, and we didn't do anything about it. It's all about money and control, isn't it?",
            "So, you know, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I really think it's a personal preference, something that science is showing is more likely biological than anything else.  To take away someone's rights because of something they can't control, something that's part of who they are, feels just plain wrong to me. It's like, inhuman, you know? I've always been a supporter of gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. This is a personal thing, a family thing. It's not something the state should be dictating. At home, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of gay couples who are together, but can't get married because the law won't let them. They live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go to work, they're part of the community. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. It's people's lives, their love, their commitment.  \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how studies are showing that there's a biological basis for being gay, something that's in your brain chemistry. It's like you're born that way, not something you choose. It's not about how you were raised or your environment. \n\nBesides the obvious,  it just feels… yeah, like it's a private matter. A guy and a girl can marry without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to get married, it's a huge deal. It's like they're making a public spectacle out of it when it should just be a personal celebration.  It should be kept in the private realm, not splashed all over the news.",
            "Alright, listen up. When you chuck something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. It's public, plain and simple. \n\nBeing an RA, I've seen this firsthand.  Whatever you put online, it sticks. People will judge you based on it. If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shooting things, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss these things out there. The internet's a wild beast; everyone's got a peek. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, you get their updates.\n\nNow, the school probably didn't get an official warning from Myspace. Someone saw something, got worried, and told the school. They had to act, you know?  Imagine if something bad happened, and they could have stopped it?  \n\nBut, here's the catch - sometimes people mess around, right? They joke around, and it can get misinterpreted. Like, maybe it was just a crazed sociology project gone wrong. Or maybe, just maybe, it was something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone heard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked through the kid's Facebook, and found some stuff that, in light of the situation, was pretty darn scary. It might have been a joke, but it looked bad.\n\nThe thing is, once you put something online, there's no privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it! Don't expect to control what people think.\n\nNow, I'm not saying school officials should be stalking their students on Facebook. That's creepy! But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously. \n\nI mean, I don't think they should be snooping through texts or IMs unless they have a good reason. But if something's brought up, they have to investigate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.",
            "Right, so I feel like this whole war has dragged on for far too long.  At the start, I get it, there was a good reason, right?  Helping another country get its democracy going.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just in it because we have to be, like we're trying to prove we're the big dogs.  Plus, the whole thing started because of, you know, whatever issues Bush Sr. had with Saddam back in the day. So maybe the reasons we started this weren't so pure to begin with.\n\nIf the goal was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have one, that's a good thing, a righteous thing. But I don't think that's what's happening anymore. It's like we've lost our way, and now it's all about winning, about not backing down, even though it's been going on for years.\n\nListen, maybe in those first few months, dropping that bombshell made a statement, but come on, it's been way too long.  Their government, their people, they have to figure things out on their own eventually. We can't keep throwing money and lives into this thing forever.\n\nThink about it: we're spending billions and billions, money that could be helping people here at home.  We have our own problems, poverty, things we need to fix, but instead, we're pouring it all into this war that doesn't even have a clear purpose anymore.\n\nWe need to stop. We need to bring our troops home. There comes a point where you just have to say enough is enough. We can't keep bleeding money and lives for a war we've already lost.",
            "So, lemme ask,  you know, there was this thing, right?  Seems like someone saw somethin' online, like on Myspace, and it, like, stopped some bad stuff from happening. I get that it's kind of a bummer, ya know, people lookin' at your stuff without permission. But isn't Myspace kinda public, like, if you put it out there, it's kinda fair game?\n\nI mean, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you chose to be their friend, right?  So it's kinda like givin' them the okay to see that stuff.\n\nIt's like, anything you put online, you gotta expect that some folks might see it.\n\nI guess if someone saw somethin' that could've saved someone's life, that's a good thing, right?\n\nBut,  uh, it's tough, right?  I mean, you can't have someone watchin' everyone's Myspace all day, lookin' for trouble.\n\nThat'd be like, pickin' on the \"bad kids\" or somethin'.\n\nI don't know, maybe it depends on the situation.\n\nLike, were they lookin' for somethin' specific, or just snoopin'?\n\nI don't know, it's a sticky wicket.\n\nMe, I don't have Myspace, but I got Facebook.\n\nIt freaks me out a little thinkin' about creeps out there seein' my stuff.\n\nI saw this thing on TV once, about this dude who could find people's info real fast, like, got their screen name and started talkin' to 'em on IM in like, less than a minute, and got 'em to meet up.\n\nI wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes IM'in me, and they know it's me, even though I don't recognize their names.\n\nIt's creepy, 'cause they know all about you, your classes, your friends, your photos. \n\nI try to keep it clean, but it's hard, 'cause Facebook is supposed to be for connectin' with friends.\n\nSo, it's a double-edged sword, ya know?\n\nYou put stuff out there, you gotta expect some folks might see it.\n\n I heard my roommate talkin' about her high school, they banned Myspace.\n\nThat's kinda weird, right? How can they tell you what you can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing makes me want to pull my hair out.  It feels hypocritical even talking about it, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start.  I mean, I was, but honestly, does it even matter now?  It's like everyone knows it was a bad idea except for those in charge who just can't admit they messed up. \n\nYou look at the polls, it's insane.  Everywhere you look, seventy-five to eighty percent of people think it was a disaster – Iraqis, Americans, even the troops over there.  They want out!  And who can blame them?  It's been a train wreck from day one, and pulling out is just gonna be another dumpster fire.  The Middle East is a tangled mess, and our culture just clashes so badly with theirs.  It's like these politicians think they can just force democracy on them, but it's not that simple.  It's their culture, their way of life, and it's not like they asked for our help.\n\nSure, Saddam was a jerk, no question.  But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country, and this was just a recipe for disaster.  It's like quicksand, the deeper we get, the harder it is to get out.  \n\nHonestly, I don't even know what to say anymore.  I can't see any reason to stay there, and I haven't heard a single good reason from the administration.  Maybe a slow pullout over a year or so wouldn't be so bad, but just leaving now?  I think the people of Iraq deserve a say in this, and if they want us gone, maybe we should listen.  At least then we can wash our hands of it and say, \"We gave you the chance, but you chose to go your own way.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do.  But at least this way we'd be less of a problem.",
            "Ya know what? I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women. It's more like, depending on the field you're in, you know? Like for women, there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  \n\nMen sometimes have a hard time taking orders from a woman, just because of how things have always been. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't promote her because, well, history tells them women aren't supposed to be in charge. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other areas. Think about stay-at-home dads. It's super rare for a guy to be the one at home with the kids. People often judge them, thinking, \"Shouldn't the man be out earning money?\"  It can be tough on them when their dream is to raise their kids and their wife has the better job, even if it all works out great for their family. Society just doesn't get it. \n\nAnd in fashion? Guys can get overlooked if they're straight. Not sure if that makes sense, but people might think, \"How can a guy *really* understand fashion if he's not a woman?\" It's like, \"Oh, you're not like the other guys, so you must not know what you're talking about.\"\n\nSo yeah, depending on what you do, there's definitely gender discrimination.  Changing it is slow, though. We've come a long way from the 1800s for sure, but people have set ways of thinking.  Slowly, women are climbing the corporate ladder, becoming CEOs, and being accepted in business.  More men are becoming stay-at-home dads, and people are starting to see that it can work.  \n\nI think it's all about showing the good qualities of those who are stereotyped.  If you push too hard, people resist. We're finding a balance, but change takes time.",
            "So, get this, they didn't exactly legalize it, more like took the handcuffs off, y'know? Demystified it, turned it from a full-blown criminal offense to, like, a parking ticket.  You get a slap on the wrist instead of being thrown in the slammer. But here's the kicker, man, even with this decriminalization thing, the fear of a drug charge still lingers. Job interviews, background checks, all that jazz. It's a shadow that follows you, even if you're not facing jail time.  \n\nIt's crazy, right?  Think about it, the system spends a fortune locking people up for weed.  Courts, lawyers, housing, the whole nine yards. Where's that money going? Could it be going towards, you know, helping people instead of punishing them?  \n\nSeems like cities struggling financially could really use that cash. But then again, some places are just dead set against marijuana, no matter what. It's like a principle thing.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, I think it's a win-win. More money for schools, social programs, helping those in need.  It's a step in the right direction. \n\nBut let's be real, we don't want weed everywhere, blowing up like cigarettes in gas stations. There are valid concerns about that. It's still a bit taboo in many circles. Imagine the awkwardness, right? \n\nAnd alcohol, that's a different beast.  It messes with your motor skills more directly.  But marijuana, it can mess with your life in other ways, your choices, your priorities.  \n\nIt's a double-edged sword, man.  It affects everyone differently. Some people are responsible, some go overboard. It's hard to say for sure what the right answer is.",
            "I reckon I'd say yes, mostly because a lot of their traditions are pretty solid, like they've been doing the same stuff for ages. That's cool, you know, having roots. But it's also gotta be alright to change with the times, right? \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know feel this pressure to go to church every week, and there's a real strictness around how things are done. It's like they judge folks who don't follow every single rule perfectly. They don't seem too keen on folks who aren't, like, totally Catholic either, you know? And they don't really roll out the welcome mat for people from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Talk about not being open-minded, right?  We were always taught to love everyone, which is a big Catholic thing. But it feels kinda bogus when they preach that and then don't even accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like, the rules say one thing, but the way things are actually done is totally different. It's all so stuck in the past, and they just cling to it even though it seems kinda outdated.  \n\nNow, I think letting priests get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from, you know, doing the bad stuff. It's a whole 'nother level, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they probably gonna hurt kids regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about something messed up inside them, not about being single.  So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop that from happening.\n\nNope.",
            "Ugh, man, this whole thing is a real head-scratcher. I'm not sure where I stand on it yet, you know? It's tough to say if either side is totally right or wrong. This feels like the biggest, most tangled mess we're dealing with right now. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage even means.  It's a real minefield, trying to talk about this without stepping on anyone's toes.\n\nI dunno, maybe... maybe all civil unions are the way to go.  Should the government even be in charge of defining marriage, anyway?  It's like a sacrament, right? People don't get special tax breaks or anything from the government just for being baptized. So, if you're married, maybe the government should just see it as a civil union - two people, that's all it is. No need to get into the whole church and state thing, just recognize that two people are together.\n\nAnd with gay marriage...  I mean, it's just like any other civil union, right? Two people, love, commitment. If all the states could agree on that, maybe it should just become federal law.\n\nBut trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's insane! The Constitution shouldn't be messed with just because some people feel strongly about something. It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but not big enough to change the foundation of our country. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nNope, not worth it.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I've got tons of gay friends, you know? It's not something I totally agree with, but I believe everyone should have the right to marry who they love. It shouldn't be a national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves.\n\n  Like, you've got your blue states and your red states, right?  Blue states tend to be more open to gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, well, that's how they feel about it. It's their call. You kinda knew what you were getting into when you moved there.\n\n It's all about equal opportunity for everyone. Homosexuals deserve the same chances as anyone else, so legalizing it on a state-by-state basis seems fair.\n\n Honestly, I don't think the president should have the power to ban gay marriage across the whole country. It's up to the states to decide what's best for their own people. \n\nLook, Bush is leaving office soon anyway. What happens then? If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth forever. Let each state figure it out for themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, like, Myspace is a public thing, right? It's like a bulletin board where everyone can see what you post. If you put something on there, you gotta know that people will see it - teachers, parents, even the principal.\n\nSo, if the school sees something on Myspace that worries them, like talk about a potential shooting, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could easily find it from home. \n\nI get that it's creepy for them to snoop, especially if they're just looking for reasons to punish kids for drinking or smoking. But if they're trying to prevent something really bad, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay. Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, right?\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't write something bad about someone in an email if you didn't want them to see it, right? Because once something is online, it's out there forever.  \n\nIt's scary to think that something you post online could come back to bite you later, like when you're an adult. People can find old stuff from your Myspace days, even if you thought you deleted it. \n\nSo, yeah, I think it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, it's a invasion of privacy. On the other hand, they're trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Alright, so, the war... man.  At first, I was all in, you know?  Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I wanted payback.  I was ready to cause some serious chaos, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were fueled by emotion.  We didn't really think things through, went in unprepared, without a plan.  And it blew up in our faces.  I mean, I was for it then, but now?  I'm completely against it.\n\nI don't think it accomplished anything.  Those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  If they can't even get along, how are we supposed to help?  Frankly, Nine Eleven kinda made me lose all care about what happens over there.\n\nThey're just... different, you know?  They fight like savages, and I don't think they're really aiming to improve their country. They just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's best.  We should just pack up and leave.  We were just hyped up, driven by revenge.  Bush felt the pressure, the people wanted action.  And yeah, I get it, declaring war on Iraq seemed like the only option after what happened.\n\nBut we needed a better plan.  We didn't know what we were facing, and war over there is different.  We lacked unity, no clear goals, and it just spiraled out of control.  We went in driven by anger, and that's what we created over there.  I don't think we're capable of changing them. They're always going to be like that.\n\nI've said enough.  It's gone on long enough.  Sure, we've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just collapse once we leave, and we can't stay forever.  We're hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so I think the Catholic Church needs to evolve a bit, you know? Like, I hear they're losing followers, and I think it might be because some of their views are, well, a little stuck in the past.  \n\nTake gay marriage, abortion, birth control – these are hot button issues, and the Church's stance on them is pretty strong.  Now, they have the right to their beliefs, but maybe if they opened their minds a little, they wouldn't be losing so many people.  \n\nI hear folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with how they handle these things.  It's like, if the Church says abortion is wrong and you believe it's okay, you might not feel comfortable being part of that group. Same with gay marriage – if that's something you support, you might not want to belong to a place that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married.  It's not like those things would magically solve all their problems, but maybe it would help.  Like, maybe if priests had families, they wouldn't be so quick to, you know, *do those things*.  I mean, it's hard to say for sure, right?",
            "So, like, gay marriage, huh? Well, I ain't sayin' it's wrong, you know? I dunno, maybe it's somethin' you're just born with, like, not a choice, ya dig? Like, I was born straight, and some folks are born gay, right?  Seems kinda unfair to hold 'em responsible for somethin' they weren't choosin',  y'know?\n\nIt just seems messed up to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two ladies can't.  Haven't really thought too hard about it, but it feels wrong,  ya know?\n\nIt's like, they don't get to pick who they're attracted to,  it's just how they are.  I mean, shouldn't we be cool with that? Shouldn't the government stay outta people's love lives?  It ain't like it's threatenin' national security or nothin'. Seems kinda private, y'know?\n\nIt's like, why put 'em on a stage and make 'em feel bad for  who they are? Like they made a wrong choice or somethin'.  Nah, man, that ain't right.  Let 'em live their lives,  love who they love,  it's not hurtin' nobody.",
            "So, I'm all for gay marriage, ya know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are gonna mess up straight families, but come on! It's just not the same thing.  It's like two sides of the same coin – different, but still connected.  \n\nThere's a whole bunch of rights that come with marriage, like property and healthcare. Think about it, if your partner's gay, they can't even visit you in the hospital! It's crazy, right? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and healthy as straight ones.  They've got the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat bugs me is that folks get hung up on the religious angle.  Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church – they just want a legal document, something the government issues.  If the government isn't involved in religion, why should it matter?\n\nIt's like segregation – separating people based on who they are isn't fair. Gay couples are just like straight couples – they have the same roles, the same dynamics.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and kids. Will they be okay? But the truth is, parenting skills are the same, whether you're gay or straight.  It's about love and care, not orientation.  Plus, some kids of gay parents face bullying in schools. It's heartbreaking, and it shouldn't be happening.\n\nLook, I think the government needs to step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about equality and treating everyone fairly.  President Bush seems to have strong religious views that get in the way, but morality is subjective! It's not something the government should be dictating.  \n\nSome folks think being gay is a psychological problem, but the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. We need to listen to experts and evidence, not just rumors and prejudice.",
            "Alright, so listen up, I work in a hospital pharmacy, you know?  See, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's all bad. Like,  I think making drugs available to everyone is a big no-no, but for medical uses?  Totally a yes. Cause come on, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good uses, right? It's not like it's inherently bad.  \n\nI mean, think about it,  we pharmacies use all kinds of crazy drugs that are totally illegal, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, all that jazz. They're controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why not give marijuana the same chance, ya know? \n\nPeople get all hung up on it being taboo, but it ain't like alcohol. Sure, alcohol can be bad too, but weed, if you mess with it too much, it's not gonna kill ya like some hard stuff. It's a tricky thing, I guess. Maybe we should legalize it little by little, not all at once, so folks don't go crazy. But first, we gotta ditch that whole scary \"Reefer Madness\" vibe, ya know? \n\nPeople freak out about marijuana 'cause it's illegal, but honestly, it ain't as bad as heroin or cocaine.  If we stop picturing it as this evil drug, maybe people will use it responsibly. And for medical stuff?  Definitely.",
            "So, I think the church has totally changed with the times, you know? It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was a kid, every Sunday was a big deal - cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too. We'd go to church every week, but now things are different. \n\nThey've got this teen mass thing, which is only like thirty minutes long. People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. I've seen people show up straight from the beach! And even at the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, people are rocking jeans and khakis now.  \n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. As for all the other stuff, like the scandals with priests, well, I don't really know about all that political stuff. But yeah, the church seems a lot more laid-back these days.",
            "(laughs)\n\nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, the whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil. At first, I was kinda okay with the idea, but then 9/11 happened, and everything changed. It felt like we rushed into this war, using 9/11 as a smokescreen.\n\nThey kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but that's all been proven false. The Bush administration straight up lied to us, and they haven't even admitted it! It's like they don't even care about the Constitution.\n\nI mean, even Colin Powell, remember that big speech he gave at the UN? Now he says he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong. That's a crime, plain and simple.\n\nIt feels like they came into office wanting to go to war, and they twisted everything to make it happen. I heard this one guy, a former Treasury Secretary, said they were practically itching for a fight. And don't even get me started on the whole oil thing – using a war to control resources? So shady.\n\nIt's been going on for way too long. Pulling out now would be messy, though, probably cause a civil war and more deaths. But sending in Syria and Saudi Arabia to \"fix\" things? That doesn't feel right either. It's like they're just going to keep meddling in Iraq's affairs, and that's not good for anyone.\n\nAnd the Iraqi government? What a mess! Parliament's useless, the Prime Minister has no real power, and these radical groups are running wild. It's like a powder keg waiting to explode.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq?  Man, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, you know?  I mean, it wasn't even a real war, officially. It just felt like a \"get back at Iraq\" thing, like they were the ones behind 9/11. \n\nHonestly, I'm not really into politics or keeping up with all the details. But it seems like we're still there trying to build a democracy, like we want Iraq to become another USA. And, let's be real, oil is a big part of it too. \n\nThe thing is, it's making everyone mad.  We can't just force democracy on them overnight. It takes time, and if we leave before it's set, they'll be even more messed up.  It's a real catch-22.\n\nSee, I'm not good with tough topics like this. It's so complicated! \n\nBut I guess I feel like we should stay, help them out, but it's a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, kind of like how Vietnam is still seen as a bad thing.\n\nOn the other hand, I know there are families with loved ones in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. \n\nIt's a mess! They have their own culture, and we're trying to force ours on them. It just feels like it's making things worse, stirring up more hatred.\n\nI think this war will drag on forever, and nobody wins in the end. It's a real bummer.",
            "Ugh, I just can't see how legalizing it is right. It feels wrong, like the government overstepping its bounds. The Constitution, man, it's crystal clear about separating church and state. They're trying to force their beliefs on everyone, picking and choosing which churches get to decide what's right and wrong. It's like saying Catholics get to rule the roost on this one, even though most of them are against it.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is what makes this country great, you know? It lets everyone practice their faith freely.  Trying to change that with an amendment feels like going against everything the Constitution stands for. Plus, wouldn't it be the first amendment ever meant to restrict people instead of the government?  \n\nThis whole thing just feels off. The government shouldn't be telling churches what they can and can't do. It should be up to them, not some politician pushing his own beliefs, especially when they go against the grain of what the Constitution already says.  \n\nI just don't see how it impacts the economy or anything else. Maybe even a positive vibe, who knows? It's all about personal choice, not government interference.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  Let me tell ya, I don't think the government straight up told the American people the whole truth about why we went in there. They tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, but honestly, those two things weren't really connected. The government played on people's emotions, you know? They were angry after 9/11, and they used that anger to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam – another mistake the government should've learned from.  Tons of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and just ripped out Iraq's government without a solid plan for what would happen next. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt. Now we're stuck there trying to put in a democracy, which is a tough job, even in a country that's ready for it.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – trying to push out communism and force democracy on a people who weren't ready for it. It wasn't a clear victory, more like a long, painful loss. You can't just win hearts and minds by force.  Even if some people support you, there are always going to be insurgents fighting back. It's impossible to fight a whole nation.\n\nThe government should've known this going in.  They should've planned for all the possibilities.  They made it seem like this would be a quick, clean win, but it's been dragging on forever.  We're still there in 2006, American troops are still dying, and the Iraqi government is still struggling to hold together.\n\nIt's a tough situation.  I mean, we can't just leave them now after all the chaos we've unleashed. But how long can we keep putting our own people at risk for a country that might never be truly free?\n\nAnd then there's the whole oil thing. Are we really fighting this war for democracy, or are we fighting for access to their resources? We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, and we didn't do anything about it. It's all about money and control, isn't it?",
            "So, you know, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I really think it's a personal preference, something that science is showing is more likely biological than anything else.  To take away someone's rights because of something they can't control, something that's part of who they are, feels just plain wrong to me. It's like, inhuman, you know? I've always been a supporter of gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. This is a personal thing, a family thing. It's not something the state should be dictating. At home, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of gay couples who are together, but can't get married because the law won't let them. They live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go to work, they're part of the community. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. It's people's lives, their love, their commitment.  \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how studies are showing that there's a biological basis for being gay, something that's in your brain chemistry. It's like you're born that way, not something you choose. It's not about how you were raised or your environment. \n\nBesides the obvious,  it just feels… yeah, like it's a private matter. A guy and a girl can marry without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to get married, it's a huge deal. It's like they're making a public spectacle out of it when it should just be a personal celebration.  It should be kept in the private realm, not splashed all over the news.",
            "Alright, listen up. When you chuck something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. It's public, plain and simple. \n\nBeing an RA, I've seen this firsthand.  Whatever you put online, it sticks. People will judge you based on it. If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shooting things, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss these things out there. The internet's a wild beast; everyone's got a peek. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, you get their updates.\n\nNow, the school probably didn't get an official warning from Myspace. Someone saw something, got worried, and told the school. They had to act, you know?  Imagine if something bad happened, and they could have stopped it?  \n\nBut, here's the catch - sometimes people mess around, right? They joke around, and it can get misinterpreted. Like, maybe it was just a crazed sociology project gone wrong. Or maybe, just maybe, it was something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone heard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked through the kid's Facebook, and found some stuff that, in light of the situation, was pretty darn scary. It might have been a joke, but it looked bad.\n\nThe thing is, once you put something online, there's no privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it! Don't expect to control what people think.\n\nNow, I'm not saying school officials should be stalking their students on Facebook. That's creepy! But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously. \n\nI mean, I don't think they should be snooping through texts or IMs unless they have a good reason. But if something's brought up, they have to investigate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.",
            "Right, so I feel like this whole war has dragged on for far too long.  At the start, I get it, there was a good reason, right?  Helping another country get its democracy going.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just in it because we have to be, like we're trying to prove we're the big dogs.  Plus, the whole thing started because of, you know, whatever issues Bush Sr. had with Saddam back in the day. So maybe the reasons we started this weren't so pure to begin with.\n\nIf the goal was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have one, that's a good thing, a righteous thing. But I don't think that's what's happening anymore. It's like we've lost our way, and now it's all about winning, about not backing down, even though it's been going on for years.\n\nListen, maybe in those first few months, dropping that bombshell made a statement, but come on, it's been way too long.  Their government, their people, they have to figure things out on their own eventually. We can't keep throwing money and lives into this thing forever.\n\nThink about it: we're spending billions and billions, money that could be helping people here at home.  We have our own problems, poverty, things we need to fix, but instead, we're pouring it all into this war that doesn't even have a clear purpose anymore.\n\nWe need to stop. We need to bring our troops home. There comes a point where you just have to say enough is enough. We can't keep bleeding money and lives for a war we've already lost.",
            "So, lemme ask,  you know, there was this thing, right?  Seems like someone saw somethin' online, like on Myspace, and it, like, stopped some bad stuff from happening. I get that it's kind of a bummer, ya know, people lookin' at your stuff without permission. But isn't Myspace kinda public, like, if you put it out there, it's kinda fair game?\n\nI mean, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you chose to be their friend, right?  So it's kinda like givin' them the okay to see that stuff.\n\nIt's like, anything you put online, you gotta expect that some folks might see it.\n\nI guess if someone saw somethin' that could've saved someone's life, that's a good thing, right?\n\nBut,  uh, it's tough, right?  I mean, you can't have someone watchin' everyone's Myspace all day, lookin' for trouble.\n\nThat'd be like, pickin' on the \"bad kids\" or somethin'.\n\nI don't know, maybe it depends on the situation.\n\nLike, were they lookin' for somethin' specific, or just snoopin'?\n\nI don't know, it's a sticky wicket.\n\nMe, I don't have Myspace, but I got Facebook.\n\nIt freaks me out a little thinkin' about creeps out there seein' my stuff.\n\nI saw this thing on TV once, about this dude who could find people's info real fast, like, got their screen name and started talkin' to 'em on IM in like, less than a minute, and got 'em to meet up.\n\nI wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes IM'in me, and they know it's me, even though I don't recognize their names.\n\nIt's creepy, 'cause they know all about you, your classes, your friends, your photos. \n\nI try to keep it clean, but it's hard, 'cause Facebook is supposed to be for connectin' with friends.\n\nSo, it's a double-edged sword, ya know?\n\nYou put stuff out there, you gotta expect some folks might see it.\n\n I heard my roommate talkin' about her high school, they banned Myspace.\n\nThat's kinda weird, right? How can they tell you what you can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing makes me want to pull my hair out.  It feels hypocritical even talking about it, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start.  I mean, I was, but honestly, does it even matter now?  It's like everyone knows it was a bad idea except for those in charge who just can't admit they messed up. \n\nYou look at the polls, it's insane.  Everywhere you look, seventy-five to eighty percent of people think it was a disaster – Iraqis, Americans, even the troops over there.  They want out!  And who can blame them?  It's been a train wreck from day one, and pulling out is just gonna be another dumpster fire.  The Middle East is a tangled mess, and our culture just clashes so badly with theirs.  It's like these politicians think they can just force democracy on them, but it's not that simple.  It's their culture, their way of life, and it's not like they asked for our help.\n\nSure, Saddam was a jerk, no question.  But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country, and this was just a recipe for disaster.  It's like quicksand, the deeper we get, the harder it is to get out.  \n\nHonestly, I don't even know what to say anymore.  I can't see any reason to stay there, and I haven't heard a single good reason from the administration.  Maybe a slow pullout over a year or so wouldn't be so bad, but just leaving now?  I think the people of Iraq deserve a say in this, and if they want us gone, maybe we should listen.  At least then we can wash our hands of it and say, \"We gave you the chance, but you chose to go your own way.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do.  But at least this way we'd be less of a problem.",
            "Ya know what? I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women. It's more like, depending on the field you're in, you know? Like for women, there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  \n\nMen sometimes have a hard time taking orders from a woman, just because of how things have always been. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't promote her because, well, history tells them women aren't supposed to be in charge. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other areas. Think about stay-at-home dads. It's super rare for a guy to be the one at home with the kids. People often judge them, thinking, \"Shouldn't the man be out earning money?\"  It can be tough on them when their dream is to raise their kids and their wife has the better job, even if it all works out great for their family. Society just doesn't get it. \n\nAnd in fashion? Guys can get overlooked if they're straight. Not sure if that makes sense, but people might think, \"How can a guy *really* understand fashion if he's not a woman?\" It's like, \"Oh, you're not like the other guys, so you must not know what you're talking about.\"\n\nSo yeah, depending on what you do, there's definitely gender discrimination.  Changing it is slow, though. We've come a long way from the 1800s for sure, but people have set ways of thinking.  Slowly, women are climbing the corporate ladder, becoming CEOs, and being accepted in business.  More men are becoming stay-at-home dads, and people are starting to see that it can work.  \n\nI think it's all about showing the good qualities of those who are stereotyped.  If you push too hard, people resist. We're finding a balance, but change takes time.",
            "So, get this, they didn't exactly legalize it, more like took the handcuffs off, y'know? Demystified it, turned it from a full-blown criminal offense to, like, a parking ticket.  You get a slap on the wrist instead of being thrown in the slammer. But here's the kicker, man, even with this decriminalization thing, the fear of a drug charge still lingers. Job interviews, background checks, all that jazz. It's a shadow that follows you, even if you're not facing jail time.  \n\nIt's crazy, right?  Think about it, the system spends a fortune locking people up for weed.  Courts, lawyers, housing, the whole nine yards. Where's that money going? Could it be going towards, you know, helping people instead of punishing them?  \n\nSeems like cities struggling financially could really use that cash. But then again, some places are just dead set against marijuana, no matter what. It's like a principle thing.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, I think it's a win-win. More money for schools, social programs, helping those in need.  It's a step in the right direction. \n\nBut let's be real, we don't want weed everywhere, blowing up like cigarettes in gas stations. There are valid concerns about that. It's still a bit taboo in many circles. Imagine the awkwardness, right? \n\nAnd alcohol, that's a different beast.  It messes with your motor skills more directly.  But marijuana, it can mess with your life in other ways, your choices, your priorities.  \n\nIt's a double-edged sword, man.  It affects everyone differently. Some people are responsible, some go overboard. It's hard to say for sure what the right answer is.",
            "I reckon I'd say yes, mostly because a lot of their traditions are pretty solid, like they've been doing the same stuff for ages. That's cool, you know, having roots. But it's also gotta be alright to change with the times, right? \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know feel this pressure to go to church every week, and there's a real strictness around how things are done. It's like they judge folks who don't follow every single rule perfectly. They don't seem too keen on folks who aren't, like, totally Catholic either, you know? And they don't really roll out the welcome mat for people from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Talk about not being open-minded, right?  We were always taught to love everyone, which is a big Catholic thing. But it feels kinda bogus when they preach that and then don't even accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like, the rules say one thing, but the way things are actually done is totally different. It's all so stuck in the past, and they just cling to it even though it seems kinda outdated.  \n\nNow, I think letting priests get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from, you know, doing the bad stuff. It's a whole 'nother level, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they probably gonna hurt kids regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about something messed up inside them, not about being single.  So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop that from happening.\n\nNope.",
            "Ugh, man, this whole thing is a real head-scratcher. I'm not sure where I stand on it yet, you know? It's tough to say if either side is totally right or wrong. This feels like the biggest, most tangled mess we're dealing with right now. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage even means.  It's a real minefield, trying to talk about this without stepping on anyone's toes.\n\nI dunno, maybe... maybe all civil unions are the way to go.  Should the government even be in charge of defining marriage, anyway?  It's like a sacrament, right? People don't get special tax breaks or anything from the government just for being baptized. So, if you're married, maybe the government should just see it as a civil union - two people, that's all it is. No need to get into the whole church and state thing, just recognize that two people are together.\n\nAnd with gay marriage...  I mean, it's just like any other civil union, right? Two people, love, commitment. If all the states could agree on that, maybe it should just become federal law.\n\nBut trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's insane! The Constitution shouldn't be messed with just because some people feel strongly about something. It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but not big enough to change the foundation of our country. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nNope, not worth it.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I've got tons of gay friends, you know? It's not something I totally agree with, but I believe everyone should have the right to marry who they love. It shouldn't be a national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves.\n\n  Like, you've got your blue states and your red states, right?  Blue states tend to be more open to gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, well, that's how they feel about it. It's their call. You kinda knew what you were getting into when you moved there.\n\n It's all about equal opportunity for everyone. Homosexuals deserve the same chances as anyone else, so legalizing it on a state-by-state basis seems fair.\n\n Honestly, I don't think the president should have the power to ban gay marriage across the whole country. It's up to the states to decide what's best for their own people. \n\nLook, Bush is leaving office soon anyway. What happens then? If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth forever. Let each state figure it out for themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, like, Myspace is a public thing, right? It's like a bulletin board where everyone can see what you post. If you put something on there, you gotta know that people will see it - teachers, parents, even the principal.\n\nSo, if the school sees something on Myspace that worries them, like talk about a potential shooting, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could easily find it from home. \n\nI get that it's creepy for them to snoop, especially if they're just looking for reasons to punish kids for drinking or smoking. But if they're trying to prevent something really bad, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay. Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, right?\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't write something bad about someone in an email if you didn't want them to see it, right? Because once something is online, it's out there forever.  \n\nIt's scary to think that something you post online could come back to bite you later, like when you're an adult. People can find old stuff from your Myspace days, even if you thought you deleted it. \n\nSo, yeah, I think it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, it's a invasion of privacy. On the other hand, they're trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Alright, so, the war... man.  At first, I was all in, you know?  Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I wanted payback.  I was ready to cause some serious chaos, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were fueled by emotion.  We didn't really think things through, went in unprepared, without a plan.  And it blew up in our faces.  I mean, I was for it then, but now?  I'm completely against it.\n\nI don't think it accomplished anything.  Those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  If they can't even get along, how are we supposed to help?  Frankly, Nine Eleven kinda made me lose all care about what happens over there.\n\nThey're just... different, you know?  They fight like savages, and I don't think they're really aiming to improve their country. They just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's best.  We should just pack up and leave.  We were just hyped up, driven by revenge.  Bush felt the pressure, the people wanted action.  And yeah, I get it, declaring war on Iraq seemed like the only option after what happened.\n\nBut we needed a better plan.  We didn't know what we were facing, and war over there is different.  We lacked unity, no clear goals, and it just spiraled out of control.  We went in driven by anger, and that's what we created over there.  I don't think we're capable of changing them. They're always going to be like that.\n\nI've said enough.  It's gone on long enough.  Sure, we've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just collapse once we leave, and we can't stay forever.  We're hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Right, so I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? They're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly open-minded about a lot of stuff. Like, gay marriage, abortion, birth control - the Catholic Church's got some pretty strong, and frankly, kinda outdated views on these things. I get that they have beliefs, but sometimes they seem stuck in the past.  If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be sweating about losing people. People are starting to ditch the Church because they disagree with their stance on these things. They think the Church is on the wrong side of history, you know?  Take abortion, for example. The Church is against it, and if you're pro-choice, you probably wouldn't feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it. Same with gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be in a place that doesn't. \n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests? Why can't priests be married? It seems like a no-brainer to me! Maybe that could've stopped some of the drama, but who knows? It's hard to say for sure. It's like, they're saying priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't they have both?",
            "Y'know,  I'm not against gay marriage, not one bit. I think, uh, whether someone's born that way or, you know, whatever, it ain't like a choice you make on purpose, ya know? So, I think, uh, folks shouldn't be blamed for bein' gay or whatever. It just seems wrong to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI ain't really thought about it too much, but, uh, yeah, it just seems wrong to me. Like, it ain't a choice, ya know? Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It just seems like it's how you are, and you shouldn't be held responsible for that.\n\n(clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to say they can't get married. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it ain't really a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really.  I mean, these folks, they shouldn't be, uh, put on a platform like they made a bad choice or somethin'.  It ain't right.\n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in it. It's just, it's nothin' to do with the country's safety or morals or anythin'. They're just lettin' their noses into folks' lives, and that ain't right. It's just who they are, you know? They shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI mean, it's hard to explain, but, yeah, I just think they should be left alone.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out on this gay marriage thing.  It's like, there's really no good reason not to do it, you know?  A bunch of folks think gay couples are gonna mess up the whole \"straight family\" thing, but honestly, it's just not the same.  It's like, two sides of the same coin, right? Different, but still connected.  Think of it like this, it's not about heads or tails, it's just different faces of the same darn thing.  \n\nAnd, get this, there are all these rights tied up in marriage, like taxes and health care.  It's a real bummer when your partner can't be there for you when you're sick because they're not \"family\" in the eyes of the law.  I mean, if you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you? \n\nPlus, science, man, science!  There've been tons of studies, and guess what? Gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples.  It's all about love and connection, the same stuff that makes any relationship work.\n\nLook, gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document, a marriage certificate.  It's about government recognition, not religious approval.  And if church and state are supposed to be separate, why should religion get in the way of this?  I mean, if you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage?  It's like, separate but unequal, right?  \n\nThen there's the whole adoption thing, and how people worry about gay families affecting the community.  What about the kids?  Will they be okay?  Well, studies are still happening, but it's pretty clear that parenting skills are the same for everyone, regardless of who they love.  It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.  \n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  We need an amendment that says yes, absolutely!  It's just common sense, really.  \n\nBut, you know, President Bush seems pretty set in his ways, probably because of his religion.  It's a bummer because it feels like a lot of this comes down to morality, and morality is different for everyone.  It's not right to force one group's beliefs on everyone else, especially when it comes to something as personal as marriage.  \n\nAnd, honestly, a lot of folks who are against gay marriage think gay people are somehow broken or damaged, like it's a choice or a disease.  But the American Psychological Association has said that's not true. It's just prejudice and ignorance.  We need to listen to experts and evidence, not to our friends or what's popular.",
            "Alright, so listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy, right?  And lemme tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal don't mean it's all bad. I mean, think about it, there are loads of drugs we use in the pharmacy that are totally illegal for the public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - those are all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why deny those benefits just because there's some stink around marijuana? It's like, get real!  \n\nI get it, alcohol's legal, and people can still abuse it, but marijuana ain't exactly harmless itself if you go overboard.  It's a tricky one, but I think we should ease into legalizing it, ya know?  Not just jump in headfirst, 'cause that'd be a disaster. We gotta ditch this whole \"marijuana is evil\" image first. Once people see it's not the devil's lettuce, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical stuff.  It ain't heroin or cocaine, for crying out loud!",
            "So, the church, I think it's totally changed with the times, you know? Not as strict as it used to be. Like, when I was a kid, I'd go to church every Sunday, all dressed up. Little dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang! I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too on the weekends. We'd just go, no big deal. \n\nBut now that I'm older, they've got this \"teenager mass\" thing, thirty minutes tops, super casual.  People show up straight from the beach in their swimsuits during summer, families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress to the nines, now it's jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are cool, but it's a lot less fancy now.  \n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed, honestly. I mean, that's the church I know. I don't really know about all the political stuff going on behind the scenes, but yeah, that's it. \n\nSpeaking of the church, those accusations against priests, the whole pedophilia thing... I don't think changing things like allowing female priests or letting them get married would have stopped it. You've got married guys out there who are pedophiles too, right? It's just about the person, not whether or not they're married.\n\nBesides, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where they get married, like on \"7th Heaven\" or whatever.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nYou see, I think it's kind of like genetics.  People are born with certain tendencies, you know?  It's not something that's learned. It might be influenced a little by upbringing, but mostly it's just who they are. You can't really change that with marriage, can you? \n\nMaybe the church could have done something if they knew about it and covered it up, but I don't think they knew about everything.",
            "So, I'm not okay with the whole Iraq War thing, you know? Like, yeah, we were all shook after 9/11. But I think the Bush crew used that fear to push us into Iraq, waving around these claims about Saddam Hussein and WMDs - stuff that turned out to be total BS.  \n\nIt really grinds my gears that they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, he's admitted now he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he was strutting around the UN! That's messed up, man. That's like, grounds for impeachment, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole Bush administration seems to have this disregard for the Constitution, especially since 9/11. It's like they're trying to shove it aside. \n\nI get this feeling they came into office wanting to go to war, and I hear whispers about that crazy ex-treasury guy who spilled the beans in his book after getting kicked out. It seems like Bush Jr. had a bone to pick with Saddam, maybe because of what happened to his dad. Plus, he probably wanted to snatch up Iraq's oil reserves - real sneaky move, don't you think?\n\nLook, I know pulling out now would be a mess, probably spark a civil war, and more people would die. But this whole UN and regional powers trying to fix things? I'm not so sure about that either. It's like, who are they to decide what happens in Iraq? It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, you know? \n\nAnd their government? A total shambles. Their Parliament's a joke, the Prime Minister's got no real power, and remember that guy, al-Sadr, the one we were fighting not too long ago? Well, his party controls a chunk of Parliament now! It's all just a big, fractious mess.",
            "I mean, this whole Iraq thing is a mess, right?  It feels pointless, like a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11.  We just went in there because we thought they were responsible, but honestly, I don't know the details.  It's not like a proper war, you know?  Congress never officially declared it.  \n\nThey say we're there to build democracy and secure oil, but it's just making everyone angry.  We're trying to force democracy on a country that's not ready for it, and if we leave, they'll be even more screwed. It's a lose-lose situation.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure what the answer is.  It's a tough topic, and I don't have all the answers.  Maybe we should just try to help them out, but it feels like we're wasting resources and making things worse.  It's got this whole Vietnam vibe, you know?  Bush is going to be remembered for this forever, just like Vietnam.\n\nPlus, what about the soldiers?  Their families are suffering too.  But at the same time, we're disrupting their culture, forcing our values on them.  It's just creating more hatred and division. \n\nIt's a tangled mess.  I just wish there was a better way.",
            "Ugh, I just don't feel right about making this legal or having the state declare it so. It seems like it should be up to the churches, ya know? The Constitution even says separation of church and state – it's pretty clear! Trying to force any kind of power over this feels like going against what's already written in stone.  \n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe up in Boston and some places like that. But it just doesn't seem right for the government to decide what churches can and can't make legal or illegal. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of the Constitution and allows for religious tolerance in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's totally wrong and goes against what's already there. Plus, it would probably be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people instead of the government. That just feels off.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this at all. I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over all the others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.  There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else.  Maybe it could even help society more than hurt it.",
            "Right, so about this Iraq war thing... I don't think the government played straight with the American people about why we went in. Before invading, they tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used the public's fear and anger after 9/11 to push the invasion in 2003, which I think was a big mistake.\n\nSee, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes. This whole Iraq thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam – the government didn't learn from past blunders. So many American soldiers have died, and for what? They went in, toppled the government, but weren't ready for the chaos that followed. They were trying to install a democracy, just like in Vietnam, pushing out Communism and putting in their own system. But they should have known it wouldn't be easy.\n\nIt's not like a quick victory.  Even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there'd always be resistance, a bunch of angry citizens fighting back. It's a tough situation, and I think the government misled the people, making it seem like a simple mission.  \n\nThey didn't plan for the long haul. It takes time to build a stable government, like it did here in the US. It wasn't easy, with all the struggle and civil war. We're still there, years later, training Iraqi troops, and it's a slow process. The government should have been honest about the challenges involved.\n\nAnd here's the thing, why just Iraq? Why not other countries that need \"democratizing\"?  It feels like it's all about the oil, controlling resources, and that's not a strong enough reason to risk so many lives. Plus, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but never found any. Meanwhile, places like North Korea have them, and we're not doing anything about it.\n\nIt all feels a bit shady to me.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there eventually. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I mean, it's a personal thing, right?  And you know, more and more, science is showing it's probably biological, not just some choice people make. So, like, why take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, politics and government shouldn't even be in this. It's personal, between people, not some big state or national issue.  Heck, in my old neighborhood, there were a couple gay couples, not married 'cause they couldn't be, but they lived just like any other family. Walked their dogs, you know?  It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff,  studies and news reports, saying it's actually a thing in your brain, like a chemical thing that makes you gay.  Not like you grow up with brothers and sisters and that's why you're gay. It's biological, not sociological. \n\nBesides the obvious, it's just weird that a guy and a girl can get married secretly in Vegas and nobody cares, but two guys or two girls want to get hitched and it's front-page news.\n\nIt should be totally private, a personal thing, not some big public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out.  When you post something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can see it.  As a Resident Advisor, I've dealt with this firsthand.  What you put out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss that out there for the world to see.  The internet is a big ol' public square.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, they get that bulletin.  \n\nNow, it's not like the school directly saw it, someone went to them, and they had to act.  They can't just ignore it, right?  What if something actually happens? They'd be in trouble for not doing anything.  But then again, sometimes people just mess around online.  It could be a sociology class experiment gone wrong, ya know?  Or it could be something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, told someone, and it got passed on.  They looked through this kid's Facebook, and some stuff on there, meant as a joke, suddenly looked super scary.  When you put stuff online, there's no such thing as privacy.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control how people interpret it, or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook, snooping through their profiles.  But if it's brought to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy, because it's information they got from someone who shared it.  If there's a threat, they have to take it seriously.\n\nIt's different if they're monitoring phone calls and texts, that's crossing a line. But if it's brought to their attention, that's another story.  \n\nJust think, a teacher shouldn't create a fake profile to friend their students.  That's creepy!  I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're out partying and posting pics on Facebook.  It's not my place, and it's none of my business.",
            "Man, this whole war just feels dragged out, you know? I get it, the idea at the start was cool, right? Like, bringing democracy to a place that really needed it.  But now? It feels like we've totally lost sight of that. We're just doing it for show, proving we're some kind of world superpower or something. I even think maybe the reasons for starting it in the first place were kinda shady, with all that old stuff about Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI mean, if the goal was to help a country get a fair political system, that's a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal crap mixed in there, that's not cool. Either way, it's gone on way too long. We made our point in the first few months, hitting 'em hard and showing them we weren't messing around. But years later, it's just... pointless.\n\nIt feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting now. We don't want to back down without a clear win, a big victory. But honestly, it's time to cut our losses. Their government has to figure things out eventually, and it's been long enough. We're spending billions, draining our own economy, when we have our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. That money should be going to help our own people, not to keep this war going for no good reason.\n\nI just think it's time to walk away. We've been bleeding money and lives for a cause we've lost. It's time to bring our soldiers home and focus on fixing our own mess.",
            "So, like, someone's asking if it's okay that someone found info on Myspace and stopped something bad from happening.  \n\nI get it, it's a sticky situation.  I mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda public, right?  Like, yeah, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission.  It's weird to think that stuff can be used against you, you know? \n\nIt's tough to say if it's right for someone to be watching everyone's profiles all the time.  Like, they can't possibly look at everyone, and it kinda feels like picking on people if they only focus on the \"bad kids.\"  It'd be like, \"Let's spy on those who might cause trouble.\" That's not cool.  \n\nBut I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or just randomly snooping? \n\n\nI have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing creepy people can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it is to find info about people. He found a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on instant messenger within a minute, and then got her to meet up!  That's insane, I'd never do that!\n\n I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook, even though they don't know me in real life. It's creepy because they know my name, my interests, even where I am during the day.  It's hard to know who to trust. I try to keep my stuff private, but then it's hard to connect with friends. \n\nIt's a weird balance, you know?   \n\n\nI heard my roommate say that her high school banned Myspace. That seems kinda over the top, though.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, I dunno, it's just frustrating, you know?  Talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical, like I'm jumping on the bandwagon. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's hard to say it matters now, 'cause everyone's against it except, like, the people in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong.\n\nIt's crazy, every poll - American, Iraqi, global - shows like 75 to 80 percent of people think it was a bad idea. Even the troops over there, 70 percent of them, think we should pull out within a year!\n\nIt's a mess, total disaster from the beginning, and it's gonna be a disaster to leave too.  The whole Middle East is just so complicated. It's like trying to force democracy on people who don't want it, you know? It's a cultural clash, and our government just doesn't get it.\n\nYeah, Saddam was bad, but invading was such a huge gamble, and it's just turned into quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI just don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure they have some reasons, but haven't heard anything convincing yet. If they wanna pull out gradually, over a year or so, I guess that's okay, but just leaving now seems the best option. \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, a quarter of them want us gone now!  We're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAt least if we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then it's not on us if things go south. We could be like, \"Hey, you guys said you wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be trying to do the right thing.",
            "So, yeah, I think gender discrimination is still a real thing in the U.S., and it's not just women who feel it. It kind of depends on the field you're in, you know? \n\nFor women, there's still that \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we're supposed to be equal, a lot of guys have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages. \n\nSo, women might be super qualified for a job, but the board might not choose them because, historically, women aren't seen as top leaders. And it's the same deal for guys in some fields, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's super uncommon to see a dad at home, and people judge them for it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they think, \"Why isn't he out working?\"  It sucks because maybe he's always dreamed of being with his kids and helping out, even if his wife has the better job. \n\nAnd in fashion, straight dudes sometimes get overlooked because people think, \"How can a guy really know about fashion?\"  They assume dudes in fashion must be living a different sort of life, so they question their expertise. \n\nIt's all about these outdated stereotypes, and it's tough to change because society's got its groove.  \n\nWe've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are more accepted, but it's a gradual process.  \n\nIt's like, we can't force it, or people will resist. We gotta show people the good stuff about these stereotyped roles – the amazing qualities of women in leadership, dads at home, and dudes in fashion – and let them see the value.",
            "So, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They went for decriminalization.  Think of it like this: it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not nabbed, booked, and thrown in a cell.  But here's the thing, even with decriminalization, those job interview worries and other hassles still linger. Future consequences, they stick around.  It's a conundrum, really. Arresting, booking, housing folks, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors - it all costs a bundle.  And for municipalities struggling financially, that's a big pill to swallow, even if it frees up cash for schools, social programs, and helping the less fortunate.   \n\nIt's a matter of philosophy, too. Some places are staunchly against marijuana, no ifs, ands, or buts. But in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, well, it seems like a win-win. They probably have more dough to spend on important stuff now.\n\nBut here's the thing, I'm not saying we should just go wild with marijuana, like cigarettes in every gas station. It's still a sensitive subject, and having it out in the open might feel weird to some.\n\nWhat about driving under the influence? Alcohol's a bigger threat to driving, but weed can mess with your life in other ways, ya know? It's a personal thing, really. Some people handle it better than others.\n\nBottom line: both have downsides, and how folks react varies. It's a tricky issue, no easy answers.",
            "You know, I'd say \"yeah,\" to Catholicism, 'cause a lot of what they do is rooted in tradition, and that's a good thing. It's important to have those roots, you know? But at the same time, you gotta be able to bend with the times, gotta be adaptable. \n\nI guess a lot of Catholics think they have to be in church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Sometimes it feels like they look down on folks who don't follow the rules perfectly, like they don't accept people who aren't cookie-cutter Catholics. And they're not exactly open to other religions, either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem too loving to me. They preach about loving everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who aren't exactly like them. It feels hypocritical, you know?\n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing, but then their actions say something else. Their practices feel outdated, stuck in the past, but they keep clinging to them anyway. \n\nI think it would be cool if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing bad things. It's a different issue altogether.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are gonna hurt kids, no matter if they're married or not. It's not about having a spouse; it's about something else entirely.",
            "Man, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher.  I haven't quite figured it out yet. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means. It's tough, you know?  \n\nI mean, think about it.  If we're talking about marriage as a sacred thing, like a religious sacrament, shouldn't the government stay out of it? Just like they don't mess with folks who get baptized, right?  Maybe it's simpler to just see marriage as a civil union, a legal recognition of two people who want to be together.\n\nIt's all about two people joining forces, no matter who they are.  The government shouldn't care if it's a church wedding or a courthouse ceremony. They should just recognize it as a union, plain and simple.\n\nNow, with gay marriage, it's like, hey, if two people want to commit to each other, why not let them?  It seems pretty straightforward to me.  If all the states can agree on something, maybe it's time to make it federal law.\n\nBut, banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this. Sure, it's important to some people, but it's not something that deserves to be written into the law of the land. It's just not that big a deal.",
            "So, growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a bit of a complicated thing for me. I've got plenty of gay friends, you know? I guess I don't totally agree with their lifestyle, but I think it's something everyone should have the right to choose.  It shouldn't be a national battle, though.  Each state should decide for themselves.  \n\nIt's kinda like how some states lean Democrat and others lean Republican.  Democratic states are more likely to push for gay marriage, and if you're living in one of those states, you're kinda accepting that's how things are there.  You chose to live there, right?\n\nLook, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities.  So yeah, I'm all for legalizing it, but I think it should be up to each state to decide.  \n\nIt's not right for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what they can and can't do.  Gay marriage should be decided at a state level, not by the president. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to make that call for everyone.  It's just not his place.  Besides, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democrat comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it's just gonna keep going back and forth. Let each state decide what's best for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, Myspace is like, totally public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you post something there, you gotta know people, like, even the school, could see it.  I mean, even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still check it out from home. \n\nBut here's the thing:  if checking Myspace helps keep students safe, like, prevents a shooting, then I think it's totally okay. It's the school's job to keep everyone safe, you know? \n\nI get that some people think it's an invasion of privacy if the school is just snooping around for stuff like drinking or smoking. But, if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a shooting, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nIt's kinda like how I don't just say anything bad about people in emails. I mean, you never know who might see it later, right? Everything you post online kinda stays there forever. Like, what if you do something dumb as a college student and then, years later, some big-shot finds that email? Oops.\n\nSo, yeah, I think if the school is using Myspace to keep kids safe, that's totally legit.",
            "Ok, so, about this whole war thing... at first, I was totally on board. Nine eleven hit close to home, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. I think it was all fueled by emotion, though. We went in there unprepared, without a real plan. It was like a knee-jerk reaction. \n\nNow, looking back, I'm totally against it. I don't think it achieved anything. It's like, if those people can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?  Honestly, because of nine eleven, I've just become numb to what's happening over there. Those people... I don't even know if they're human. They're so locked in their own conflicts, they can't see beyond themselves.\n\nWe went in blind, clueless about what we'd face. War is different there, brutal and savage. They're not fighting for a better future, they just want us out.  I think we should just leave. \n\nWe were hyped up on anger and revenge, not thinking about the consequences. President Bush probably felt pressured too, the people wanted action. But, declaring war on Iraq, that was a huge decision.  I get where he was coming from, but we should have had a better plan. What were we even trying to achieve? There was no clear goal, no unity of purpose. \n\nIt's like we went in there expecting to change their whole way of life, but we're not the ones to do that. They're too entrenched in their own ways.  \n\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. We're just prolonging the pain, hurting ourselves in the process. It's time to move on."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Right, so I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? They're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly open-minded about a lot of stuff. Like, gay marriage, abortion, birth control - the Catholic Church's got some pretty strong, and frankly, kinda outdated views on these things. I get that they have beliefs, but sometimes they seem stuck in the past.  If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be sweating about losing people. People are starting to ditch the Church because they disagree with their stance on these things. They think the Church is on the wrong side of history, you know?  Take abortion, for example. The Church is against it, and if you're pro-choice, you probably wouldn't feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it. Same with gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be in a place that doesn't. \n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests? Why can't priests be married? It seems like a no-brainer to me! Maybe that could've stopped some of the drama, but who knows? It's hard to say for sure. It's like, they're saying priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't they have both?",
            "Y'know,  I'm not against gay marriage, not one bit. I think, uh, whether someone's born that way or, you know, whatever, it ain't like a choice you make on purpose, ya know? So, I think, uh, folks shouldn't be blamed for bein' gay or whatever. It just seems wrong to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI ain't really thought about it too much, but, uh, yeah, it just seems wrong to me. Like, it ain't a choice, ya know? Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It just seems like it's how you are, and you shouldn't be held responsible for that.\n\n(clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to say they can't get married. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it ain't really a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really.  I mean, these folks, they shouldn't be, uh, put on a platform like they made a bad choice or somethin'.  It ain't right.\n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in it. It's just, it's nothin' to do with the country's safety or morals or anythin'. They're just lettin' their noses into folks' lives, and that ain't right. It's just who they are, you know? They shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI mean, it's hard to explain, but, yeah, I just think they should be left alone.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out on this gay marriage thing.  It's like, there's really no good reason not to do it, you know?  A bunch of folks think gay couples are gonna mess up the whole \"straight family\" thing, but honestly, it's just not the same.  It's like, two sides of the same coin, right? Different, but still connected.  Think of it like this, it's not about heads or tails, it's just different faces of the same darn thing.  \n\nAnd, get this, there are all these rights tied up in marriage, like taxes and health care.  It's a real bummer when your partner can't be there for you when you're sick because they're not \"family\" in the eyes of the law.  I mean, if you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you? \n\nPlus, science, man, science!  There've been tons of studies, and guess what? Gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples.  It's all about love and connection, the same stuff that makes any relationship work.\n\nLook, gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document, a marriage certificate.  It's about government recognition, not religious approval.  And if church and state are supposed to be separate, why should religion get in the way of this?  I mean, if you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage?  It's like, separate but unequal, right?  \n\nThen there's the whole adoption thing, and how people worry about gay families affecting the community.  What about the kids?  Will they be okay?  Well, studies are still happening, but it's pretty clear that parenting skills are the same for everyone, regardless of who they love.  It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.  \n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  We need an amendment that says yes, absolutely!  It's just common sense, really.  \n\nBut, you know, President Bush seems pretty set in his ways, probably because of his religion.  It's a bummer because it feels like a lot of this comes down to morality, and morality is different for everyone.  It's not right to force one group's beliefs on everyone else, especially when it comes to something as personal as marriage.  \n\nAnd, honestly, a lot of folks who are against gay marriage think gay people are somehow broken or damaged, like it's a choice or a disease.  But the American Psychological Association has said that's not true. It's just prejudice and ignorance.  We need to listen to experts and evidence, not to our friends or what's popular.",
            "Alright, so listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy, right?  And lemme tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal don't mean it's all bad. I mean, think about it, there are loads of drugs we use in the pharmacy that are totally illegal for the public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - those are all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why deny those benefits just because there's some stink around marijuana? It's like, get real!  \n\nI get it, alcohol's legal, and people can still abuse it, but marijuana ain't exactly harmless itself if you go overboard.  It's a tricky one, but I think we should ease into legalizing it, ya know?  Not just jump in headfirst, 'cause that'd be a disaster. We gotta ditch this whole \"marijuana is evil\" image first. Once people see it's not the devil's lettuce, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical stuff.  It ain't heroin or cocaine, for crying out loud!",
            "So, the church, I think it's totally changed with the times, you know? Not as strict as it used to be. Like, when I was a kid, I'd go to church every Sunday, all dressed up. Little dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang! I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too on the weekends. We'd just go, no big deal. \n\nBut now that I'm older, they've got this \"teenager mass\" thing, thirty minutes tops, super casual.  People show up straight from the beach in their swimsuits during summer, families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress to the nines, now it's jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are cool, but it's a lot less fancy now.  \n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed, honestly. I mean, that's the church I know. I don't really know about all the political stuff going on behind the scenes, but yeah, that's it. \n\nSpeaking of the church, those accusations against priests, the whole pedophilia thing... I don't think changing things like allowing female priests or letting them get married would have stopped it. You've got married guys out there who are pedophiles too, right? It's just about the person, not whether or not they're married.\n\nBesides, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where they get married, like on \"7th Heaven\" or whatever.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nYou see, I think it's kind of like genetics.  People are born with certain tendencies, you know?  It's not something that's learned. It might be influenced a little by upbringing, but mostly it's just who they are. You can't really change that with marriage, can you? \n\nMaybe the church could have done something if they knew about it and covered it up, but I don't think they knew about everything.",
            "So, I'm not okay with the whole Iraq War thing, you know? Like, yeah, we were all shook after 9/11. But I think the Bush crew used that fear to push us into Iraq, waving around these claims about Saddam Hussein and WMDs - stuff that turned out to be total BS.  \n\nIt really grinds my gears that they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, he's admitted now he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he was strutting around the UN! That's messed up, man. That's like, grounds for impeachment, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole Bush administration seems to have this disregard for the Constitution, especially since 9/11. It's like they're trying to shove it aside. \n\nI get this feeling they came into office wanting to go to war, and I hear whispers about that crazy ex-treasury guy who spilled the beans in his book after getting kicked out. It seems like Bush Jr. had a bone to pick with Saddam, maybe because of what happened to his dad. Plus, he probably wanted to snatch up Iraq's oil reserves - real sneaky move, don't you think?\n\nLook, I know pulling out now would be a mess, probably spark a civil war, and more people would die. But this whole UN and regional powers trying to fix things? I'm not so sure about that either. It's like, who are they to decide what happens in Iraq? It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, you know? \n\nAnd their government? A total shambles. Their Parliament's a joke, the Prime Minister's got no real power, and remember that guy, al-Sadr, the one we were fighting not too long ago? Well, his party controls a chunk of Parliament now! It's all just a big, fractious mess.",
            "I mean, this whole Iraq thing is a mess, right?  It feels pointless, like a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11.  We just went in there because we thought they were responsible, but honestly, I don't know the details.  It's not like a proper war, you know?  Congress never officially declared it.  \n\nThey say we're there to build democracy and secure oil, but it's just making everyone angry.  We're trying to force democracy on a country that's not ready for it, and if we leave, they'll be even more screwed. It's a lose-lose situation.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure what the answer is.  It's a tough topic, and I don't have all the answers.  Maybe we should just try to help them out, but it feels like we're wasting resources and making things worse.  It's got this whole Vietnam vibe, you know?  Bush is going to be remembered for this forever, just like Vietnam.\n\nPlus, what about the soldiers?  Their families are suffering too.  But at the same time, we're disrupting their culture, forcing our values on them.  It's just creating more hatred and division. \n\nIt's a tangled mess.  I just wish there was a better way.",
            "Ugh, I just don't feel right about making this legal or having the state declare it so. It seems like it should be up to the churches, ya know? The Constitution even says separation of church and state – it's pretty clear! Trying to force any kind of power over this feels like going against what's already written in stone.  \n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe up in Boston and some places like that. But it just doesn't seem right for the government to decide what churches can and can't make legal or illegal. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of the Constitution and allows for religious tolerance in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's totally wrong and goes against what's already there. Plus, it would probably be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people instead of the government. That just feels off.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this at all. I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over all the others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.  There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else.  Maybe it could even help society more than hurt it.",
            "Right, so about this Iraq war thing... I don't think the government played straight with the American people about why we went in. Before invading, they tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used the public's fear and anger after 9/11 to push the invasion in 2003, which I think was a big mistake.\n\nSee, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes. This whole Iraq thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam – the government didn't learn from past blunders. So many American soldiers have died, and for what? They went in, toppled the government, but weren't ready for the chaos that followed. They were trying to install a democracy, just like in Vietnam, pushing out Communism and putting in their own system. But they should have known it wouldn't be easy.\n\nIt's not like a quick victory.  Even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there'd always be resistance, a bunch of angry citizens fighting back. It's a tough situation, and I think the government misled the people, making it seem like a simple mission.  \n\nThey didn't plan for the long haul. It takes time to build a stable government, like it did here in the US. It wasn't easy, with all the struggle and civil war. We're still there, years later, training Iraqi troops, and it's a slow process. The government should have been honest about the challenges involved.\n\nAnd here's the thing, why just Iraq? Why not other countries that need \"democratizing\"?  It feels like it's all about the oil, controlling resources, and that's not a strong enough reason to risk so many lives. Plus, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but never found any. Meanwhile, places like North Korea have them, and we're not doing anything about it.\n\nIt all feels a bit shady to me.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there eventually. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I mean, it's a personal thing, right?  And you know, more and more, science is showing it's probably biological, not just some choice people make. So, like, why take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, politics and government shouldn't even be in this. It's personal, between people, not some big state or national issue.  Heck, in my old neighborhood, there were a couple gay couples, not married 'cause they couldn't be, but they lived just like any other family. Walked their dogs, you know?  It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff,  studies and news reports, saying it's actually a thing in your brain, like a chemical thing that makes you gay.  Not like you grow up with brothers and sisters and that's why you're gay. It's biological, not sociological. \n\nBesides the obvious, it's just weird that a guy and a girl can get married secretly in Vegas and nobody cares, but two guys or two girls want to get hitched and it's front-page news.\n\nIt should be totally private, a personal thing, not some big public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out.  When you post something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can see it.  As a Resident Advisor, I've dealt with this firsthand.  What you put out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss that out there for the world to see.  The internet is a big ol' public square.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, they get that bulletin.  \n\nNow, it's not like the school directly saw it, someone went to them, and they had to act.  They can't just ignore it, right?  What if something actually happens? They'd be in trouble for not doing anything.  But then again, sometimes people just mess around online.  It could be a sociology class experiment gone wrong, ya know?  Or it could be something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, told someone, and it got passed on.  They looked through this kid's Facebook, and some stuff on there, meant as a joke, suddenly looked super scary.  When you put stuff online, there's no such thing as privacy.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control how people interpret it, or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook, snooping through their profiles.  But if it's brought to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy, because it's information they got from someone who shared it.  If there's a threat, they have to take it seriously.\n\nIt's different if they're monitoring phone calls and texts, that's crossing a line. But if it's brought to their attention, that's another story.  \n\nJust think, a teacher shouldn't create a fake profile to friend their students.  That's creepy!  I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're out partying and posting pics on Facebook.  It's not my place, and it's none of my business.",
            "Man, this whole war just feels dragged out, you know? I get it, the idea at the start was cool, right? Like, bringing democracy to a place that really needed it.  But now? It feels like we've totally lost sight of that. We're just doing it for show, proving we're some kind of world superpower or something. I even think maybe the reasons for starting it in the first place were kinda shady, with all that old stuff about Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI mean, if the goal was to help a country get a fair political system, that's a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal crap mixed in there, that's not cool. Either way, it's gone on way too long. We made our point in the first few months, hitting 'em hard and showing them we weren't messing around. But years later, it's just... pointless.\n\nIt feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting now. We don't want to back down without a clear win, a big victory. But honestly, it's time to cut our losses. Their government has to figure things out eventually, and it's been long enough. We're spending billions, draining our own economy, when we have our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. That money should be going to help our own people, not to keep this war going for no good reason.\n\nI just think it's time to walk away. We've been bleeding money and lives for a cause we've lost. It's time to bring our soldiers home and focus on fixing our own mess.",
            "So, like, someone's asking if it's okay that someone found info on Myspace and stopped something bad from happening.  \n\nI get it, it's a sticky situation.  I mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda public, right?  Like, yeah, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission.  It's weird to think that stuff can be used against you, you know? \n\nIt's tough to say if it's right for someone to be watching everyone's profiles all the time.  Like, they can't possibly look at everyone, and it kinda feels like picking on people if they only focus on the \"bad kids.\"  It'd be like, \"Let's spy on those who might cause trouble.\" That's not cool.  \n\nBut I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or just randomly snooping? \n\n\nI have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing creepy people can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it is to find info about people. He found a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on instant messenger within a minute, and then got her to meet up!  That's insane, I'd never do that!\n\n I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook, even though they don't know me in real life. It's creepy because they know my name, my interests, even where I am during the day.  It's hard to know who to trust. I try to keep my stuff private, but then it's hard to connect with friends. \n\nIt's a weird balance, you know?   \n\n\nI heard my roommate say that her high school banned Myspace. That seems kinda over the top, though.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, I dunno, it's just frustrating, you know?  Talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical, like I'm jumping on the bandwagon. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's hard to say it matters now, 'cause everyone's against it except, like, the people in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong.\n\nIt's crazy, every poll - American, Iraqi, global - shows like 75 to 80 percent of people think it was a bad idea. Even the troops over there, 70 percent of them, think we should pull out within a year!\n\nIt's a mess, total disaster from the beginning, and it's gonna be a disaster to leave too.  The whole Middle East is just so complicated. It's like trying to force democracy on people who don't want it, you know? It's a cultural clash, and our government just doesn't get it.\n\nYeah, Saddam was bad, but invading was such a huge gamble, and it's just turned into quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI just don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure they have some reasons, but haven't heard anything convincing yet. If they wanna pull out gradually, over a year or so, I guess that's okay, but just leaving now seems the best option. \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, a quarter of them want us gone now!  We're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAt least if we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then it's not on us if things go south. We could be like, \"Hey, you guys said you wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be trying to do the right thing.",
            "So, yeah, I think gender discrimination is still a real thing in the U.S., and it's not just women who feel it. It kind of depends on the field you're in, you know? \n\nFor women, there's still that \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we're supposed to be equal, a lot of guys have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages. \n\nSo, women might be super qualified for a job, but the board might not choose them because, historically, women aren't seen as top leaders. And it's the same deal for guys in some fields, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's super uncommon to see a dad at home, and people judge them for it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they think, \"Why isn't he out working?\"  It sucks because maybe he's always dreamed of being with his kids and helping out, even if his wife has the better job. \n\nAnd in fashion, straight dudes sometimes get overlooked because people think, \"How can a guy really know about fashion?\"  They assume dudes in fashion must be living a different sort of life, so they question their expertise. \n\nIt's all about these outdated stereotypes, and it's tough to change because society's got its groove.  \n\nWe've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are more accepted, but it's a gradual process.  \n\nIt's like, we can't force it, or people will resist. We gotta show people the good stuff about these stereotyped roles – the amazing qualities of women in leadership, dads at home, and dudes in fashion – and let them see the value.",
            "So, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They went for decriminalization.  Think of it like this: it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not nabbed, booked, and thrown in a cell.  But here's the thing, even with decriminalization, those job interview worries and other hassles still linger. Future consequences, they stick around.  It's a conundrum, really. Arresting, booking, housing folks, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors - it all costs a bundle.  And for municipalities struggling financially, that's a big pill to swallow, even if it frees up cash for schools, social programs, and helping the less fortunate.   \n\nIt's a matter of philosophy, too. Some places are staunchly against marijuana, no ifs, ands, or buts. But in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, well, it seems like a win-win. They probably have more dough to spend on important stuff now.\n\nBut here's the thing, I'm not saying we should just go wild with marijuana, like cigarettes in every gas station. It's still a sensitive subject, and having it out in the open might feel weird to some.\n\nWhat about driving under the influence? Alcohol's a bigger threat to driving, but weed can mess with your life in other ways, ya know? It's a personal thing, really. Some people handle it better than others.\n\nBottom line: both have downsides, and how folks react varies. It's a tricky issue, no easy answers.",
            "You know, I'd say \"yeah,\" to Catholicism, 'cause a lot of what they do is rooted in tradition, and that's a good thing. It's important to have those roots, you know? But at the same time, you gotta be able to bend with the times, gotta be adaptable. \n\nI guess a lot of Catholics think they have to be in church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Sometimes it feels like they look down on folks who don't follow the rules perfectly, like they don't accept people who aren't cookie-cutter Catholics. And they're not exactly open to other religions, either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem too loving to me. They preach about loving everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who aren't exactly like them. It feels hypocritical, you know?\n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing, but then their actions say something else. Their practices feel outdated, stuck in the past, but they keep clinging to them anyway. \n\nI think it would be cool if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing bad things. It's a different issue altogether.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are gonna hurt kids, no matter if they're married or not. It's not about having a spouse; it's about something else entirely.",
            "Man, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher.  I haven't quite figured it out yet. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means. It's tough, you know?  \n\nI mean, think about it.  If we're talking about marriage as a sacred thing, like a religious sacrament, shouldn't the government stay out of it? Just like they don't mess with folks who get baptized, right?  Maybe it's simpler to just see marriage as a civil union, a legal recognition of two people who want to be together.\n\nIt's all about two people joining forces, no matter who they are.  The government shouldn't care if it's a church wedding or a courthouse ceremony. They should just recognize it as a union, plain and simple.\n\nNow, with gay marriage, it's like, hey, if two people want to commit to each other, why not let them?  It seems pretty straightforward to me.  If all the states can agree on something, maybe it's time to make it federal law.\n\nBut, banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this. Sure, it's important to some people, but it's not something that deserves to be written into the law of the land. It's just not that big a deal.",
            "So, growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a bit of a complicated thing for me. I've got plenty of gay friends, you know? I guess I don't totally agree with their lifestyle, but I think it's something everyone should have the right to choose.  It shouldn't be a national battle, though.  Each state should decide for themselves.  \n\nIt's kinda like how some states lean Democrat and others lean Republican.  Democratic states are more likely to push for gay marriage, and if you're living in one of those states, you're kinda accepting that's how things are there.  You chose to live there, right?\n\nLook, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities.  So yeah, I'm all for legalizing it, but I think it should be up to each state to decide.  \n\nIt's not right for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what they can and can't do.  Gay marriage should be decided at a state level, not by the president. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to make that call for everyone.  It's just not his place.  Besides, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democrat comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it's just gonna keep going back and forth. Let each state decide what's best for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, Myspace is like, totally public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you post something there, you gotta know people, like, even the school, could see it.  I mean, even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still check it out from home. \n\nBut here's the thing:  if checking Myspace helps keep students safe, like, prevents a shooting, then I think it's totally okay. It's the school's job to keep everyone safe, you know? \n\nI get that some people think it's an invasion of privacy if the school is just snooping around for stuff like drinking or smoking. But, if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a shooting, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nIt's kinda like how I don't just say anything bad about people in emails. I mean, you never know who might see it later, right? Everything you post online kinda stays there forever. Like, what if you do something dumb as a college student and then, years later, some big-shot finds that email? Oops.\n\nSo, yeah, I think if the school is using Myspace to keep kids safe, that's totally legit.",
            "Ok, so, about this whole war thing... at first, I was totally on board. Nine eleven hit close to home, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. I think it was all fueled by emotion, though. We went in there unprepared, without a real plan. It was like a knee-jerk reaction. \n\nNow, looking back, I'm totally against it. I don't think it achieved anything. It's like, if those people can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?  Honestly, because of nine eleven, I've just become numb to what's happening over there. Those people... I don't even know if they're human. They're so locked in their own conflicts, they can't see beyond themselves.\n\nWe went in blind, clueless about what we'd face. War is different there, brutal and savage. They're not fighting for a better future, they just want us out.  I think we should just leave. \n\nWe were hyped up on anger and revenge, not thinking about the consequences. President Bush probably felt pressured too, the people wanted action. But, declaring war on Iraq, that was a huge decision.  I get where he was coming from, but we should have had a better plan. What were we even trying to achieve? There was no clear goal, no unity of purpose. \n\nIt's like we went in there expecting to change their whole way of life, but we're not the ones to do that. They're too entrenched in their own ways.  \n\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. We're just prolonging the pain, hurting ourselves in the process. It's time to move on."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Right, so I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? They're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly open-minded about a lot of stuff. Like, gay marriage, abortion, birth control - the Catholic Church's got some pretty strong, and frankly, kinda outdated views on these things. I get that they have beliefs, but sometimes they seem stuck in the past.  If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be sweating about losing people. People are starting to ditch the Church because they disagree with their stance on these things. They think the Church is on the wrong side of history, you know?  Take abortion, for example. The Church is against it, and if you're pro-choice, you probably wouldn't feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it. Same with gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be in a place that doesn't. \n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests? Why can't priests be married? It seems like a no-brainer to me! Maybe that could've stopped some of the drama, but who knows? It's hard to say for sure. It's like, they're saying priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't they have both?",
            "Y'know,  I'm not against gay marriage, not one bit. I think, uh, whether someone's born that way or, you know, whatever, it ain't like a choice you make on purpose, ya know? So, I think, uh, folks shouldn't be blamed for bein' gay or whatever. It just seems wrong to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI ain't really thought about it too much, but, uh, yeah, it just seems wrong to me. Like, it ain't a choice, ya know? Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It just seems like it's how you are, and you shouldn't be held responsible for that.\n\n(clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to say they can't get married. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it ain't really a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really.  I mean, these folks, they shouldn't be, uh, put on a platform like they made a bad choice or somethin'.  It ain't right.\n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in it. It's just, it's nothin' to do with the country's safety or morals or anythin'. They're just lettin' their noses into folks' lives, and that ain't right. It's just who they are, you know? They shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI mean, it's hard to explain, but, yeah, I just think they should be left alone.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out on this gay marriage thing.  It's like, there's really no good reason not to do it, you know?  A bunch of folks think gay couples are gonna mess up the whole \"straight family\" thing, but honestly, it's just not the same.  It's like, two sides of the same coin, right? Different, but still connected.  Think of it like this, it's not about heads or tails, it's just different faces of the same darn thing.  \n\nAnd, get this, there are all these rights tied up in marriage, like taxes and health care.  It's a real bummer when your partner can't be there for you when you're sick because they're not \"family\" in the eyes of the law.  I mean, if you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you? \n\nPlus, science, man, science!  There've been tons of studies, and guess what? Gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples.  It's all about love and connection, the same stuff that makes any relationship work.\n\nLook, gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document, a marriage certificate.  It's about government recognition, not religious approval.  And if church and state are supposed to be separate, why should religion get in the way of this?  I mean, if you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage?  It's like, separate but unequal, right?  \n\nThen there's the whole adoption thing, and how people worry about gay families affecting the community.  What about the kids?  Will they be okay?  Well, studies are still happening, but it's pretty clear that parenting skills are the same for everyone, regardless of who they love.  It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.  \n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  We need an amendment that says yes, absolutely!  It's just common sense, really.  \n\nBut, you know, President Bush seems pretty set in his ways, probably because of his religion.  It's a bummer because it feels like a lot of this comes down to morality, and morality is different for everyone.  It's not right to force one group's beliefs on everyone else, especially when it comes to something as personal as marriage.  \n\nAnd, honestly, a lot of folks who are against gay marriage think gay people are somehow broken or damaged, like it's a choice or a disease.  But the American Psychological Association has said that's not true. It's just prejudice and ignorance.  We need to listen to experts and evidence, not to our friends or what's popular.",
            "Alright, so listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy, right?  And lemme tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal don't mean it's all bad. I mean, think about it, there are loads of drugs we use in the pharmacy that are totally illegal for the public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - those are all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why deny those benefits just because there's some stink around marijuana? It's like, get real!  \n\nI get it, alcohol's legal, and people can still abuse it, but marijuana ain't exactly harmless itself if you go overboard.  It's a tricky one, but I think we should ease into legalizing it, ya know?  Not just jump in headfirst, 'cause that'd be a disaster. We gotta ditch this whole \"marijuana is evil\" image first. Once people see it's not the devil's lettuce, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical stuff.  It ain't heroin or cocaine, for crying out loud!",
            "So, the church, I think it's totally changed with the times, you know? Not as strict as it used to be. Like, when I was a kid, I'd go to church every Sunday, all dressed up. Little dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang! I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too on the weekends. We'd just go, no big deal. \n\nBut now that I'm older, they've got this \"teenager mass\" thing, thirty minutes tops, super casual.  People show up straight from the beach in their swimsuits during summer, families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress to the nines, now it's jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are cool, but it's a lot less fancy now.  \n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed, honestly. I mean, that's the church I know. I don't really know about all the political stuff going on behind the scenes, but yeah, that's it. \n\nSpeaking of the church, those accusations against priests, the whole pedophilia thing... I don't think changing things like allowing female priests or letting them get married would have stopped it. You've got married guys out there who are pedophiles too, right? It's just about the person, not whether or not they're married.\n\nBesides, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where they get married, like on \"7th Heaven\" or whatever.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nYou see, I think it's kind of like genetics.  People are born with certain tendencies, you know?  It's not something that's learned. It might be influenced a little by upbringing, but mostly it's just who they are. You can't really change that with marriage, can you? \n\nMaybe the church could have done something if they knew about it and covered it up, but I don't think they knew about everything.",
            "So, I'm not okay with the whole Iraq War thing, you know? Like, yeah, we were all shook after 9/11. But I think the Bush crew used that fear to push us into Iraq, waving around these claims about Saddam Hussein and WMDs - stuff that turned out to be total BS.  \n\nIt really grinds my gears that they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, he's admitted now he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he was strutting around the UN! That's messed up, man. That's like, grounds for impeachment, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole Bush administration seems to have this disregard for the Constitution, especially since 9/11. It's like they're trying to shove it aside. \n\nI get this feeling they came into office wanting to go to war, and I hear whispers about that crazy ex-treasury guy who spilled the beans in his book after getting kicked out. It seems like Bush Jr. had a bone to pick with Saddam, maybe because of what happened to his dad. Plus, he probably wanted to snatch up Iraq's oil reserves - real sneaky move, don't you think?\n\nLook, I know pulling out now would be a mess, probably spark a civil war, and more people would die. But this whole UN and regional powers trying to fix things? I'm not so sure about that either. It's like, who are they to decide what happens in Iraq? It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, you know? \n\nAnd their government? A total shambles. Their Parliament's a joke, the Prime Minister's got no real power, and remember that guy, al-Sadr, the one we were fighting not too long ago? Well, his party controls a chunk of Parliament now! It's all just a big, fractious mess.",
            "I mean, this whole Iraq thing is a mess, right?  It feels pointless, like a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11.  We just went in there because we thought they were responsible, but honestly, I don't know the details.  It's not like a proper war, you know?  Congress never officially declared it.  \n\nThey say we're there to build democracy and secure oil, but it's just making everyone angry.  We're trying to force democracy on a country that's not ready for it, and if we leave, they'll be even more screwed. It's a lose-lose situation.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure what the answer is.  It's a tough topic, and I don't have all the answers.  Maybe we should just try to help them out, but it feels like we're wasting resources and making things worse.  It's got this whole Vietnam vibe, you know?  Bush is going to be remembered for this forever, just like Vietnam.\n\nPlus, what about the soldiers?  Their families are suffering too.  But at the same time, we're disrupting their culture, forcing our values on them.  It's just creating more hatred and division. \n\nIt's a tangled mess.  I just wish there was a better way.",
            "Ugh, I just don't feel right about making this legal or having the state declare it so. It seems like it should be up to the churches, ya know? The Constitution even says separation of church and state – it's pretty clear! Trying to force any kind of power over this feels like going against what's already written in stone.  \n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe up in Boston and some places like that. But it just doesn't seem right for the government to decide what churches can and can't make legal or illegal. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of the Constitution and allows for religious tolerance in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's totally wrong and goes against what's already there. Plus, it would probably be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people instead of the government. That just feels off.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this at all. I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over all the others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.  There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else.  Maybe it could even help society more than hurt it.",
            "Right, so about this Iraq war thing... I don't think the government played straight with the American people about why we went in. Before invading, they tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used the public's fear and anger after 9/11 to push the invasion in 2003, which I think was a big mistake.\n\nSee, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes. This whole Iraq thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam – the government didn't learn from past blunders. So many American soldiers have died, and for what? They went in, toppled the government, but weren't ready for the chaos that followed. They were trying to install a democracy, just like in Vietnam, pushing out Communism and putting in their own system. But they should have known it wouldn't be easy.\n\nIt's not like a quick victory.  Even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there'd always be resistance, a bunch of angry citizens fighting back. It's a tough situation, and I think the government misled the people, making it seem like a simple mission.  \n\nThey didn't plan for the long haul. It takes time to build a stable government, like it did here in the US. It wasn't easy, with all the struggle and civil war. We're still there, years later, training Iraqi troops, and it's a slow process. The government should have been honest about the challenges involved.\n\nAnd here's the thing, why just Iraq? Why not other countries that need \"democratizing\"?  It feels like it's all about the oil, controlling resources, and that's not a strong enough reason to risk so many lives. Plus, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but never found any. Meanwhile, places like North Korea have them, and we're not doing anything about it.\n\nIt all feels a bit shady to me.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there eventually. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I mean, it's a personal thing, right?  And you know, more and more, science is showing it's probably biological, not just some choice people make. So, like, why take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, politics and government shouldn't even be in this. It's personal, between people, not some big state or national issue.  Heck, in my old neighborhood, there were a couple gay couples, not married 'cause they couldn't be, but they lived just like any other family. Walked their dogs, you know?  It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff,  studies and news reports, saying it's actually a thing in your brain, like a chemical thing that makes you gay.  Not like you grow up with brothers and sisters and that's why you're gay. It's biological, not sociological. \n\nBesides the obvious, it's just weird that a guy and a girl can get married secretly in Vegas and nobody cares, but two guys or two girls want to get hitched and it's front-page news.\n\nIt should be totally private, a personal thing, not some big public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out.  When you post something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can see it.  As a Resident Advisor, I've dealt with this firsthand.  What you put out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss that out there for the world to see.  The internet is a big ol' public square.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, they get that bulletin.  \n\nNow, it's not like the school directly saw it, someone went to them, and they had to act.  They can't just ignore it, right?  What if something actually happens? They'd be in trouble for not doing anything.  But then again, sometimes people just mess around online.  It could be a sociology class experiment gone wrong, ya know?  Or it could be something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, told someone, and it got passed on.  They looked through this kid's Facebook, and some stuff on there, meant as a joke, suddenly looked super scary.  When you put stuff online, there's no such thing as privacy.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control how people interpret it, or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook, snooping through their profiles.  But if it's brought to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy, because it's information they got from someone who shared it.  If there's a threat, they have to take it seriously.\n\nIt's different if they're monitoring phone calls and texts, that's crossing a line. But if it's brought to their attention, that's another story.  \n\nJust think, a teacher shouldn't create a fake profile to friend their students.  That's creepy!  I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're out partying and posting pics on Facebook.  It's not my place, and it's none of my business.",
            "Man, this whole war just feels dragged out, you know? I get it, the idea at the start was cool, right? Like, bringing democracy to a place that really needed it.  But now? It feels like we've totally lost sight of that. We're just doing it for show, proving we're some kind of world superpower or something. I even think maybe the reasons for starting it in the first place were kinda shady, with all that old stuff about Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI mean, if the goal was to help a country get a fair political system, that's a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal crap mixed in there, that's not cool. Either way, it's gone on way too long. We made our point in the first few months, hitting 'em hard and showing them we weren't messing around. But years later, it's just... pointless.\n\nIt feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting now. We don't want to back down without a clear win, a big victory. But honestly, it's time to cut our losses. Their government has to figure things out eventually, and it's been long enough. We're spending billions, draining our own economy, when we have our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. That money should be going to help our own people, not to keep this war going for no good reason.\n\nI just think it's time to walk away. We've been bleeding money and lives for a cause we've lost. It's time to bring our soldiers home and focus on fixing our own mess.",
            "So, like, someone's asking if it's okay that someone found info on Myspace and stopped something bad from happening.  \n\nI get it, it's a sticky situation.  I mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda public, right?  Like, yeah, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission.  It's weird to think that stuff can be used against you, you know? \n\nIt's tough to say if it's right for someone to be watching everyone's profiles all the time.  Like, they can't possibly look at everyone, and it kinda feels like picking on people if they only focus on the \"bad kids.\"  It'd be like, \"Let's spy on those who might cause trouble.\" That's not cool.  \n\nBut I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or just randomly snooping? \n\n\nI have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing creepy people can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it is to find info about people. He found a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on instant messenger within a minute, and then got her to meet up!  That's insane, I'd never do that!\n\n I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook, even though they don't know me in real life. It's creepy because they know my name, my interests, even where I am during the day.  It's hard to know who to trust. I try to keep my stuff private, but then it's hard to connect with friends. \n\nIt's a weird balance, you know?   \n\n\nI heard my roommate say that her high school banned Myspace. That seems kinda over the top, though.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, I dunno, it's just frustrating, you know?  Talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical, like I'm jumping on the bandwagon. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's hard to say it matters now, 'cause everyone's against it except, like, the people in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong.\n\nIt's crazy, every poll - American, Iraqi, global - shows like 75 to 80 percent of people think it was a bad idea. Even the troops over there, 70 percent of them, think we should pull out within a year!\n\nIt's a mess, total disaster from the beginning, and it's gonna be a disaster to leave too.  The whole Middle East is just so complicated. It's like trying to force democracy on people who don't want it, you know? It's a cultural clash, and our government just doesn't get it.\n\nYeah, Saddam was bad, but invading was such a huge gamble, and it's just turned into quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI just don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure they have some reasons, but haven't heard anything convincing yet. If they wanna pull out gradually, over a year or so, I guess that's okay, but just leaving now seems the best option. \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, a quarter of them want us gone now!  We're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAt least if we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then it's not on us if things go south. We could be like, \"Hey, you guys said you wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be trying to do the right thing.",
            "So, yeah, I think gender discrimination is still a real thing in the U.S., and it's not just women who feel it. It kind of depends on the field you're in, you know? \n\nFor women, there's still that \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we're supposed to be equal, a lot of guys have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages. \n\nSo, women might be super qualified for a job, but the board might not choose them because, historically, women aren't seen as top leaders. And it's the same deal for guys in some fields, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's super uncommon to see a dad at home, and people judge them for it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they think, \"Why isn't he out working?\"  It sucks because maybe he's always dreamed of being with his kids and helping out, even if his wife has the better job. \n\nAnd in fashion, straight dudes sometimes get overlooked because people think, \"How can a guy really know about fashion?\"  They assume dudes in fashion must be living a different sort of life, so they question their expertise. \n\nIt's all about these outdated stereotypes, and it's tough to change because society's got its groove.  \n\nWe've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are more accepted, but it's a gradual process.  \n\nIt's like, we can't force it, or people will resist. We gotta show people the good stuff about these stereotyped roles – the amazing qualities of women in leadership, dads at home, and dudes in fashion – and let them see the value.",
            "So, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They went for decriminalization.  Think of it like this: it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not nabbed, booked, and thrown in a cell.  But here's the thing, even with decriminalization, those job interview worries and other hassles still linger. Future consequences, they stick around.  It's a conundrum, really. Arresting, booking, housing folks, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors - it all costs a bundle.  And for municipalities struggling financially, that's a big pill to swallow, even if it frees up cash for schools, social programs, and helping the less fortunate.   \n\nIt's a matter of philosophy, too. Some places are staunchly against marijuana, no ifs, ands, or buts. But in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, well, it seems like a win-win. They probably have more dough to spend on important stuff now.\n\nBut here's the thing, I'm not saying we should just go wild with marijuana, like cigarettes in every gas station. It's still a sensitive subject, and having it out in the open might feel weird to some.\n\nWhat about driving under the influence? Alcohol's a bigger threat to driving, but weed can mess with your life in other ways, ya know? It's a personal thing, really. Some people handle it better than others.\n\nBottom line: both have downsides, and how folks react varies. It's a tricky issue, no easy answers.",
            "You know, I'd say \"yeah,\" to Catholicism, 'cause a lot of what they do is rooted in tradition, and that's a good thing. It's important to have those roots, you know? But at the same time, you gotta be able to bend with the times, gotta be adaptable. \n\nI guess a lot of Catholics think they have to be in church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Sometimes it feels like they look down on folks who don't follow the rules perfectly, like they don't accept people who aren't cookie-cutter Catholics. And they're not exactly open to other religions, either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem too loving to me. They preach about loving everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who aren't exactly like them. It feels hypocritical, you know?\n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing, but then their actions say something else. Their practices feel outdated, stuck in the past, but they keep clinging to them anyway. \n\nI think it would be cool if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing bad things. It's a different issue altogether.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are gonna hurt kids, no matter if they're married or not. It's not about having a spouse; it's about something else entirely.",
            "Man, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher.  I haven't quite figured it out yet. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means. It's tough, you know?  \n\nI mean, think about it.  If we're talking about marriage as a sacred thing, like a religious sacrament, shouldn't the government stay out of it? Just like they don't mess with folks who get baptized, right?  Maybe it's simpler to just see marriage as a civil union, a legal recognition of two people who want to be together.\n\nIt's all about two people joining forces, no matter who they are.  The government shouldn't care if it's a church wedding or a courthouse ceremony. They should just recognize it as a union, plain and simple.\n\nNow, with gay marriage, it's like, hey, if two people want to commit to each other, why not let them?  It seems pretty straightforward to me.  If all the states can agree on something, maybe it's time to make it federal law.\n\nBut, banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this. Sure, it's important to some people, but it's not something that deserves to be written into the law of the land. It's just not that big a deal.",
            "So, growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a bit of a complicated thing for me. I've got plenty of gay friends, you know? I guess I don't totally agree with their lifestyle, but I think it's something everyone should have the right to choose.  It shouldn't be a national battle, though.  Each state should decide for themselves.  \n\nIt's kinda like how some states lean Democrat and others lean Republican.  Democratic states are more likely to push for gay marriage, and if you're living in one of those states, you're kinda accepting that's how things are there.  You chose to live there, right?\n\nLook, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities.  So yeah, I'm all for legalizing it, but I think it should be up to each state to decide.  \n\nIt's not right for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what they can and can't do.  Gay marriage should be decided at a state level, not by the president. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to make that call for everyone.  It's just not his place.  Besides, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democrat comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it's just gonna keep going back and forth. Let each state decide what's best for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, Myspace is like, totally public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you post something there, you gotta know people, like, even the school, could see it.  I mean, even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still check it out from home. \n\nBut here's the thing:  if checking Myspace helps keep students safe, like, prevents a shooting, then I think it's totally okay. It's the school's job to keep everyone safe, you know? \n\nI get that some people think it's an invasion of privacy if the school is just snooping around for stuff like drinking or smoking. But, if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a shooting, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nIt's kinda like how I don't just say anything bad about people in emails. I mean, you never know who might see it later, right? Everything you post online kinda stays there forever. Like, what if you do something dumb as a college student and then, years later, some big-shot finds that email? Oops.\n\nSo, yeah, I think if the school is using Myspace to keep kids safe, that's totally legit.",
            "Ok, so, about this whole war thing... at first, I was totally on board. Nine eleven hit close to home, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. I think it was all fueled by emotion, though. We went in there unprepared, without a real plan. It was like a knee-jerk reaction. \n\nNow, looking back, I'm totally against it. I don't think it achieved anything. It's like, if those people can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?  Honestly, because of nine eleven, I've just become numb to what's happening over there. Those people... I don't even know if they're human. They're so locked in their own conflicts, they can't see beyond themselves.\n\nWe went in blind, clueless about what we'd face. War is different there, brutal and savage. They're not fighting for a better future, they just want us out.  I think we should just leave. \n\nWe were hyped up on anger and revenge, not thinking about the consequences. President Bush probably felt pressured too, the people wanted action. But, declaring war on Iraq, that was a huge decision.  I get where he was coming from, but we should have had a better plan. What were we even trying to achieve? There was no clear goal, no unity of purpose. \n\nIt's like we went in there expecting to change their whole way of life, but we're not the ones to do that. They're too entrenched in their own ways.  \n\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. We're just prolonging the pain, hurting ourselves in the process. It's time to move on."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so here's the deal, I think the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly cool with a lot of stuff.  They're super against things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  And while they're entitled to their views, they're kinda stuck in the past, ya know? \n\nI feel like if they loosened up a bit, maybe embraced some newer ideas, they wouldn't be so worried about people leaving.  I've been hearing that folks are starting to ditch the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nLike, if you're pro-choice, you're probably not gonna feel comfy in a place that says abortion is totally wrong. Or if you're all about gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't support it.  \n\nIt just seems like a bit of a clash.\n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests or priests who are married?  It's not like it would hurt anything.  I don't know if it would have stopped all the bad stuff that's happened, but it's something to think about.\n\nIt's just weird to me that priests are supposed to be \"married to God,\" but they can't have families or spouses.  Everyone else gets to have both their job and their personal life.  Why not priests?",
            "Okay, so, um, me personally? I'm cool with gay marriage.  Like, I don't think it's some kinda choice people make, you know? I mean, some folks are born that way, just like some folks are born straight. It's kinda like you can't pick your hair color, right? So, it seems wrong to say, \"Oh, a man and a woman can get married, but two dudes or two gals can't.\" That just doesn't sit right with me.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems unfair. It's not like they're choosing to be gay, it's just who they are. I was born straight, but I wouldn't want someone telling me I couldn't get married because of that, y'know? So, yeah, I think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it affects national security or anything. It's just people's personal lives. I don't think it's a moral issue either.  \n\nIt's just weird to me that people would make such a big deal out of it. Like, they're not hurting anyone. It's not their fault how they feel. They shouldn't have to hide who they are or be ashamed of it. They should be able to love who they love, just like everyone else.",
            "Alright, listen up, here's the deal with gay marriage. It's a no-brainer, really. There's just no solid reason to keep it illegal.\n\nSome folks say gay couples are a threat to the traditional family, but come on, it's totally different. Think of it like two sides of the same coin – different, but still the same essential thing.\n\nAnd it's not just about love; there's a whole heap of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick 'cause they're not legally family.  It's crazy!  If you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?\n\nPlus, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about the relationship, the connection, the love – not the gender of the people involved.\n\nLet's be real, it's not about church weddings. Gay couples are just asking for a government-recognized marriage certificate, a legal document.  \n\nIt's like saying one type of love is more valid than another. If you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage? It's all about equality.\n\nAnd yeah, there are concerns about kids and adoption, but those are just fears based on ignorance. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples.  \n\nLook, I get that some people have strong religious beliefs, but the government shouldn't be making laws based on religion. That's not fair to everyone else. It's like saying only one group's morality matters.  \n\nIt's hypocritcal, considering the government itself is founded on the idea of separation of church and state.\n\nThe bottom line is, gay people deserve the same rights and respect as everyone else.  It's time to stop judging and start embracing love in all its forms.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin'. I work in a hospital pharmacy, see, and lemme just say, just 'cause somethin's illegal don't mean it ain't got some good uses.  I mean, should we just make it easy for everyone to get their hands on it? Nah, not a chance. But for medicinal purposes?  Absolutely!  Cause listen, just 'cause somethin's against the law don't mean it ain't got some good stuff going for it.  \n\nThink about it, there are a bunch of drugs pharmacies use that are totally illegal on the street, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet – they're all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they help people.  So why are we denying folks the potential benefits of marijuana just 'cause there's this whole stigma around it? \n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's exactly like alcohol, 'cause abusin' either one can lead to trouble.  It's a tricky situation, but I reckon we could ease into it – make it legal gradually, not all at once.  Otherwise, people might go overboard.  But first, we gotta knock down this whole negative image around marijuana.  \n\nPeople think it's this terrible, evil drug, but it ain't like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop seein' it as this monster, folks might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Alright, so my church, it's totally changed up in the 21st century. Not as stiff and strict as it used to be, you know?  When I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards.  I went to this private school, and all my friends would be there too. We'd just hang out. Now, they've got these teenager masses, like a 30-minute version, and everyone's dressed way more casual.  Especially in summer, folks roll in straight from the beach, you know? Families running in late, the works!\n\nEven the morning masses, where I used to get all dressed up, are chill now. Jeans and khakis are the norm.  Khakis are cool, don't get me wrong, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest thing I've noticed about the church changing. I don't really know about the behind-the-scenes stuff, all the politics, but that's the vibe I'm getting. \n\n\nNow, about those scandals with priests and stuff... I don't think making priests married would have stopped it.  I mean, there are married guys who become pedophiles, right? It's not about being married or not. It's about the person. Maybe it's a choice they make when they become priests, who knows?\n\nThere are other religions where priests can get married, like the ones on TV shows. They're ministers or something. If they really want to be married and practice their faith, maybe they should check out a different church.\n\n\n\nI think it's kind of like genetics, you know? Like, some people are just born that way.  You can't really change that.  Maybe upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly genetics.  You can try to hide it, but it usually comes out in the end.  \n\nThe church might have screwed up by covering things up, but I don't think they could have stopped it from happening in all cases.",
            "(laughs) \n  Man, September 11th really messed things up. It's like the whole world went crazy. I mean, I was okay with the idea of going into Iraq at first, but it all felt so rushed and  tense. It's like the Bush crew used 9/11 as an excuse, a big red herring, to justify invading. They were spouting about Bin Laden and WMDs, but it all turned out to be a load of crap!  It just makes me so mad that they straight up lied to the American people. \n\n  Even Colin Powell, the guy who gave that whole big speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. C'mon, that's just plain wrong. It's a slap in the face to everyone who believed them, and it feels like a major betrayal of trust. It's like they think they're above the law, like they can just make things up and the public will believe them. \n\n  And don't even get me started on how they've been treating the Constitution. It's like they're trying to push it aside, destroy it piece by piece.  They came into office with war on their minds, and maybe even some dark, personal reasons. I heard this thing about the treasury secretary who basically called them out on it in his book.  He got kicked out, but it made you wonder.\n\n  It just feels like this whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would be a mess, probably cause more bloodshed and chaos. But putting other countries in charge? Doesn't sound good either. What about Iraq's sovereignty? It's already shaky, and things are falling apart in the government. \n\n  The parliament's a joke, the prime minister can't control anything, and these religious groups are playing power games. It's a recipe for disaster, honestly. It's like a giant, messed up game of musical chairs, and nobody knows who's going to be left standing in the end. \n\n (laughs) \n  I can't even begin to explain the whole thing without getting really angry.",
            "The Iraq War, man... it's a real head-scratcher. Feels pointless, you know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, a formal declaration and all that. Just this whole \"get back at Iraq\" thing 'cause they were blamed for 9/11. Not my scene, honestly. Not really into the whole thing.\n\nI don't keep up with the details, but it seems like we're stuck there trying to build democracy, make it more like the U.S., and grab some oil while we're at it. But it's causing so much unrest, and what's the point of staying forever? Building democracy takes time, forever even, and if we leave, they'll be furious 'cause we messed everything up and they're back to square one.\n\nUgh, this is tough. This is one topic I'm clueless about.  \n\nI guess I kinda want it to continue, though. Not because it's right, but because… it's like, we gotta show 'em we're strong, you know? We're America, we got the big guns. But it's not really a war anymore, not in the traditional sense. Congress never officially declared it, so…\n\nMaybe we should just help them out, try to rebuild. But it's also a waste of resources. And poor Bush, he's taking all the heat. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, a meaningless war that'll haunt him forever.\n\nI gotta think of the families with loved ones in Iraq. They want it to keep going so their kids come home safe. These people over there deserve better, they've lost everything.

            "Right, so, I just don't feel it's right for the government to get involved in this whole thing. It's like, the Constitution says separation of church and state, right?  It's plain as day. To me, trying to make laws about something like this feels like going against what's already been written.  \n\nIt's like, you've got all these different churches, all with their own beliefs, and some are okay with it, while others aren't. It's just picking sides, you know?  Forcing one church's view on everyone else. \n\nAnd the whole idea of making it illegal?  That just seems wrong. It's like trying to tell people what they can and can't believe.   Separation of church and state is a big deal in America, it's what lets people practice their religion freely.  \n\nAdding an amendment would be like going backwards. It's gotta be one of the few amendments that'd be used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nHonestly, I don't see any reason for the government to be involved at all. This whole push for an amendment just feels like it's coming from one guy's personal beliefs. He's basically saying that his religion's view is the only one that matters.  \n\nIt should be up to the churches to decide. Let them sort it out amongst themselves. It's not the government's place to interfere.",
            "The Iraq War, man... It's messed up. I don't think the government was straight with us about why we went in there. They tried to link it to 9/11, like it was all connected, but that just wasn't true. They played on our fear and anger after that terrible day, and suddenly we were invading Iraq in 2003.  \n\nLook, I'm against war, always have been. Especially preemptive strikes – that's just wrong. This whole thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, it's heartbreaking. They went in there, ripped out the government, and weren't ready for what came next. They didn't think about the chaos, the power vacuum.  \n\nThey tried to shove democracy in there, like it's some magic cure-all, just like they did in Vietnam. Pushing out Communists, trying to force democracy on a nation, it's a recipe for disaster. It's a long, hard road, not a quick victory. \n\nIt's like, even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there's always gonna be resistance. You can't just fight an army, you're fighting the people themselves. It's messy, it's tough, and it's not a clear-cut win. \n\nWe should have been more prepared. We should have known it wouldn't be easy.  They made it seem simple, but it's not.  Taking down a government and building something new takes time, years of struggle, just ask our own history! \n\nWe're still there in 2006, more American lives lost, training their troops, trying to hold things together. It's a mess, and I just hope it ends soon, for everyone's sake. But honestly, it feels like we're stuck in a quicksand of our own making.\n\nWe're talking about getting oil, right? Controlling resources. And what about those weapons of mass destruction we were told about? They never found any! But we're not even talking about North Korea, a country we know has them. It's all so shady. \n\n\n\nWe're stuck in this war, and I just hope it ends soon, but it feels like we're doing more harm than good.",

I live in a neighborhood where there are a couple of gay couples, you know, livin' their lives just like everyone else.  They walk their dogs, they go to the store, they're just tryin' to live their lives. It's not like they're hurtin' anyone.\n\nAnd this whole Bush thing, tryin' to play God and decide what marriage means? Ridiculous, I tell ya! It's like he's trying to rewrite the rules just because he doesn't understand.\n\nThere's all this talk now about how bein' gay might be somethin' you're born with, a chemical thing in your brain. It's not like you choose to be gay, any more than you choose your eye color. \n\nThe whole thing is just messed up. If a man and a woman want to get married, they don't need anyone's permission. But if two guys or two gals want to do the same thing, it's suddenly a national scandal. It's like they're tryin' to make it a bigger deal than it needs to be. It should be a private matter, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so here's the deal.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. You can't take it back, you know? As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nThink about it:  if you're posting about blowing stuff up or shooting people, someone's going to freak out.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's out there for the whole world to see.  If your friend sees it on Myspace, that's one thing. But if someone brings it to the school's attention, they have to take it seriously. They can't just ignore it, what if something actually happens?\n\nNow, I know some people just mess around online, but you never know. It could be a joke gone wrong, like that sociology experiment we had at school.  Or it could be something really serious.\n\nHere's what happened at our school: someone overheard someone else saying something scary, so they reported it. When they tracked down the person, they looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that seemed harmless at first, but in light of the situation, it became really concerning.\n\nThe bottom line? Once you put something online, it's out there. You can't control how people interpret it. You can't tell them what to think or what to take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you gave access to your stuff shared it with them.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles and friend their students. That's just creepy. It's not my place to know if my residents are out drinking and posting about it on Facebook. I don't want that connection.",
            "This war's been dragged on far too long, ya know?  At first, I thought the goal was legit - bringing democracy to a place that needed it.  But now?  It feels like we're just proving we're some kind of big-shot superpower, like we gotta flex our muscles.  Plus, there's all this talk about Bush Sr.'s beef with Saddam back in the day.  Makes you wonder if there's more to it than meets the eye.  If the goal was to give folks a fairer shot at a say in their government, that's a good thing.  But if it was just about settling old scores, well, that ain't right. \n\nLook, I get it, the first few months showed the world we weren't messing around.  But we've been at this for years now, and it just feels wrong.  It's like we're stuck in a rut, fighting for the sake of fighting, not for any clear purpose anymore.  We need a win, a clean break, something to show we actually accomplished something.\n\nWe gotta face facts: this thing's gone on too long.  Those folks gotta figure things out on their own eventually, right?  We've been pouring billions into this, money that could be used right here at home.  We got our own problems - poverty, schools, healthcare...  These are things that need our attention, not endless war.  It's a drain on our economy, a drain on our soul.  We can't keep sending our young people to fight a war that's lost its meaning.",
            "Okay, so there's this thing, right? Someone found out about, well, something someone else posted online, and that stopped something bad from happening.  I mean, on sites like Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  Like, yeah, you need a friend request or whatever, but you're kinda giving them permission when you accept it, right?  It's like, if you put it on the internet, you gotta be cool with people seeing it.  So I think it was actually good that someone spotted that and could help.\n\nBut then, it's a bit of a dilemma, you know? It's not like someone can watch everyone's profile all day.  And what if they start targeting \"bad kids\"?  That just feels wrong.  It's gotta be some kind of balance, right?  Like, were they looking for something specific, or did they just stumble across it by chance? \n\nPersonally, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook.  It freaks me out a little knowing there are creepy people who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV once about this guy who just showed how easy it was to find info on people.  He got this girl's screen name off her profile and started chatting with her on IM within a minute.  She met up with him! I wouldn't do that, obviously.\n\nI've had people in my classes message me on Facebook who I don't recognize.  They know it's me though, and it's weird.  They know your interests, what you look like, maybe even where you are during the day.  It's a lot of info, and I try to be careful about what I post, but then again, I want to be able to connect with friends.  It's a tough balance.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed strange to me.  Like, how can they tell students what they can and can't do online?  Maybe it's a privacy thing, but I don't know.  It just felt wrong.",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing...it's just a mess. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who were \"against it from the start,\" but I was. It's just that now, it's kinda like everyone agrees it was a bad idea except for the folks in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong. \n\nAnd honestly, look at the polls. They've done them everywhere, US, Iraq, even globally, and it's like 75-80% of the world thinks it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, even! And get this, a good chunk of the US troops over there think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's just been a disaster from day one. Even before we showed up, Iraq was messed up, and now this whole leaving thing is gonna be a disaster too.  There's no easy way out when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a huge cultural clash between us and those countries.  Our government just doesn't get it. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt about it. But you gotta weigh the pros and cons before invading a country and turning it into a giant quicksand pit.\n\nI don't even know what to say anymore. The only reason I can see for staying is what the administration thinks, but I haven't heard a single good reason that makes sense. If they wanna pull out gradually over a year or so, I could see that. But why stay any longer?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them think we should just leave now!  These are the people we're supposed to be helping, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, we can say \"Well, you guys made the call.\" Then, if things go south, we can step in and help, and maybe, just maybe, we'll be seen as the good guys. \n\nBut let's be real, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Okay, so like, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a huge thing in the US. It's not just about women, though. It's more like, it depends on what kind of work you do, ya know?  \n\nI mean, overall, it seems like women still have it rougher. There's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, dudes still have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages, you know? \n\nSo, women might see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just 'cause historically, women haven't been in those top positions. It's like they're stuck looking up at the top, but no one's letting them climb.\n\nAnd the same goes for guys, like in fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  It's super rare to see a dude staying home while his wife works.  People kinda judge them for it, like, \"Dude, you should be the breadwinner!\"  Even if it's what they really want,  society pushes back hard. \n\nAnd in fashion, it's kinda weird, right? People don't always take straight dudes seriously in that world. It's like they think they can't \"get\" fashion 'cause it's supposed to be a woman's thing.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's definitely still gender discrimination in the US, and it's different depending on what you do.  Changing it is tough because people are stuck in their ways. We've come a long way from the 1800s, but slow and steady, I guess. Women are getting more CEO jobs, and people are starting to accept stay-at-home dads more. \n\nIt's all about showing people the good qualities of those who are often stereotyped. If you push too hard, people resist. We gotta be patient, I guess. Change takes time.",
            "Right, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They made it so it's not a criminal offense anymore. More like a parking ticket, you get cited instead of getting thrown in jail.  I mean,  it still hangs over ya, especially when you're lookin' for a job or whatever.  Those  ramifications, like the worst parts of a drug charge, well, they don't exactly disappear just 'cause it's decriminalized. \n\nBut, think about it, arresting folks, booking 'em, housing 'em, court dates, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all costs a bundle. A whole lotta dough.  Especially for places that are struggling financially. Some places, they're just dead set against it, even if it'd save 'em money. \n\nBut in cities like Denver, where folks are a bit more... open-minded, ya know? More liberal,  it makes sense to me.  They probably have a lot more dough now for schools, helpin' old folks, feedin' the homeless.  It's a win-win, right?\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' we should be handin' out joints like candy.  There's a reason it's still a bit taboo.  But financially, it's gotta be a factor. \n\nIf it was fully legal, imagine it everywhere, like cigarettes. Gas stations, cars, everywhere.  Folks gettin' high and drivin'?  That ain't right.\n\nAnd besides, society ain't quite ready for that kinda openness, ya know?\n\nIt's like with alcohol, it messes with your coordination, but marijuana, it messes with your whole life, ya know? They both have their downsides, but everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, others... not so much.",
            "So, about Catholicism... I mean, there's a lot to like. They've got traditions that have stood the test of time, which is cool. It's good to have roots, right? But, at the same time, you've gotta be able to adapt and change with the times. \n\nThe thing is, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church is stuck in the past. They're super strict about how things are done, and honestly, it can feel kinda judgmental towards people who don't follow the rules perfectly. Like, what about people who aren't, you know, *perfect* Catholics? Or people who practice different religions?\n\nMy dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but they wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of his religion.  That doesn't seem very loving or accepting, does it?  They preach about loving everyone but then turn around and exclude people who aren't exactly like them. It's kinda hypocritical, if you ask me.\n\nYou see, a lot of Catholic teaching is about doing good things, but then their practices don't always line up with that.  It's like they're clinging to outdated traditions even though they don't really make sense anymore.\n\nNow, about those priests who... well, you know...  I think it would be good if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing those bad things. It's a separate issue, really.\n\nI mean, people who hurt children are going to hurt children, whether they're married or not.  It's just a different kind of wrong.  Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve that problem.",
            "So, I'm kinda stuck on this whole marriage thing.  It's a real head-scratcher, ya know?  Like, where do you draw the line between church and state?  And what even *is* marriage, anyway?  It's a tough one because it feels like no matter what you say, someone's gonna get their knickers in a twist.\n\nI'm thinking maybe all these unions, whether they're called \"marriage\" or \"civil union,\" should be treated the same.  I mean, why should the government care *how* you define it, as long as it's between two consenting adults?  It's like, wouldn't it be kinda weird if the government decided to recognize baptisms or other religious stuff?  Just let people love who they love, right?\n\nAs for gay marriage, I think if states can figure out a way to make it work, then cool, let's make it federal law.  But changing the Constitution just to ban it?  That's just plain bonkers.  It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but is it *that* big of a deal to amend the Constitution over?\n\nHonestly, it just feels kinda pointless.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a complicated issue for me. \n\nSee, I have lots of gay friends, so I can't just brush it off. I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to choose who they love. \n\nThis whole thing shouldn't be a national debate, though. Each state should decide for themselves if they want to legalize gay marriage.  \n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, like California or New York, while others are more conservative, like Texas or Alabama. \n\nIf you live in a state where gay marriage is legal, well, that's just how it is there. You're basically agreeing to those rules when you move there.  \n\nLook, I think everyone deserves equal opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I'm all for legalization, but let each state make that call. \n\nIt's not right for the president to impose his views on the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide what's best for them. \n\nBesides, Bush is leaving office soon anyway.  What's the point of fighting over this when a new president could change everything in a heartbeat? \n\nLet the states figure it out, that's what I say. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Listen, I get it. Myspace is like a public billboard, right?  If you put something up there, it's basically for everyone to see, teachers included.  I mean, even if they're not using the school's name, they can still check it out from home.  It's like, if you're posting something you don't want people to see, maybe don't post it online at all. \n\nNow, I get that some people think it's a privacy invasion if they're just snooping around looking for students doing dumb stuff.  But if they see something that could prevent a shooting, or keep kids safe, well, that seems pretty important to me.  It's like, the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe, and if that means checking Myspace, so be it.\n\nThink about it: if schools are checking email, why not Myspace?  They're just trying to make sure everyone's safe, and if that means looking at what people are posting online, well, it's kind of a necessary evil, right?",
            "Okay, so, about the war...  It all started after 9/11. I was right there in the thick of it, personally affected, and fueled by anger.  I was all for going over there and dishing out some serious payback. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. It was a knee-jerk reaction,  a bit impulsive. We rushed into things without a solid plan, and honestly, it backfired spectacularly.  \n\nI mean, I used to be all for it, but now?  I'm against it completely. I don't see any real progress, any positive outcome. The people over there, they're constantly fighting amongst themselves.  How can we expect them to focus on us when they can't even get along? It feels like we're just stirring the pot, creating more chaos. \n\nTo be honest, 9/11 changed things for me. I've almost become numb to what's going on there. I just don't care anymore. They're fighting, they're killing each other, it's a vicious cycle. They seem so different from us, so savage in their approach to war. I don't think they're trying to build a better future, just trying to push us out. Maybe that's what they want, and maybe we should just give it to them.\n\nWe went in there unprepared, with no clear idea of what we were facing. War is different for them, way more brutal. We  were blinded by revenge, fueled by the need for justice after 9/11. President Bush, well, he felt the pressure from the people, wanted to act tough.  I understand where he was coming from, but maybe declaring war on Iraq was a mistake.  \n\nWe should have had a better plan, a clearer purpose. There wasn't enough unity, everyone was just reacting instead of thinking. It all felt emotional, not strategic.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we were ever meant to change those people. They're stuck in their ways, and no amount of force will break that cycle. It's time to admit we've made a mess of things and just leave.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying. They'll just fall back into chaos once we withdraw, and we can't keep throwing our lives away trying to fix it. We need to let go."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so here's the deal, I think the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly cool with a lot of stuff.  They're super against things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  And while they're entitled to their views, they're kinda stuck in the past, ya know? \n\nI feel like if they loosened up a bit, maybe embraced some newer ideas, they wouldn't be so worried about people leaving.  I've been hearing that folks are starting to ditch the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nLike, if you're pro-choice, you're probably not gonna feel comfy in a place that says abortion is totally wrong. Or if you're all about gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't support it.  \n\nIt just seems like a bit of a clash.\n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests or priests who are married?  It's not like it would hurt anything.  I don't know if it would have stopped all the bad stuff that's happened, but it's something to think about.\n\nIt's just weird to me that priests are supposed to be \"married to God,\" but they can't have families or spouses.  Everyone else gets to have both their job and their personal life.  Why not priests?",
            "Okay, so, um, me personally? I'm cool with gay marriage.  Like, I don't think it's some kinda choice people make, you know? I mean, some folks are born that way, just like some folks are born straight. It's kinda like you can't pick your hair color, right? So, it seems wrong to say, \"Oh, a man and a woman can get married, but two dudes or two gals can't.\" That just doesn't sit right with me.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems unfair. It's not like they're choosing to be gay, it's just who they are. I was born straight, but I wouldn't want someone telling me I couldn't get married because of that, y'know? So, yeah, I think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it affects national security or anything. It's just people's personal lives. I don't think it's a moral issue either.  \n\nIt's just weird to me that people would make such a big deal out of it. Like, they're not hurting anyone. It's not their fault how they feel. They shouldn't have to hide who they are or be ashamed of it. They should be able to love who they love, just like everyone else.",
            "Alright, listen up, here's the deal with gay marriage. It's a no-brainer, really. There's just no solid reason to keep it illegal.\n\nSome folks say gay couples are a threat to the traditional family, but come on, it's totally different. Think of it like two sides of the same coin – different, but still the same essential thing.\n\nAnd it's not just about love; there's a whole heap of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick 'cause they're not legally family.  It's crazy!  If you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?\n\nPlus, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about the relationship, the connection, the love – not the gender of the people involved.\n\nLet's be real, it's not about church weddings. Gay couples are just asking for a government-recognized marriage certificate, a legal document.  \n\nIt's like saying one type of love is more valid than another. If you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage? It's all about equality.\n\nAnd yeah, there are concerns about kids and adoption, but those are just fears based on ignorance. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples.  \n\nLook, I get that some people have strong religious beliefs, but the government shouldn't be making laws based on religion. That's not fair to everyone else. It's like saying only one group's morality matters.  \n\nIt's hypocritcal, considering the government itself is founded on the idea of separation of church and state.\n\nThe bottom line is, gay people deserve the same rights and respect as everyone else.  It's time to stop judging and start embracing love in all its forms.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin'. I work in a hospital pharmacy, see, and lemme just say, just 'cause somethin's illegal don't mean it ain't got some good uses.  I mean, should we just make it easy for everyone to get their hands on it? Nah, not a chance. But for medicinal purposes?  Absolutely!  Cause listen, just 'cause somethin's against the law don't mean it ain't got some good stuff going for it.  \n\nThink about it, there are a bunch of drugs pharmacies use that are totally illegal on the street, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet – they're all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they help people.  So why are we denying folks the potential benefits of marijuana just 'cause there's this whole stigma around it? \n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's exactly like alcohol, 'cause abusin' either one can lead to trouble.  It's a tricky situation, but I reckon we could ease into it – make it legal gradually, not all at once.  Otherwise, people might go overboard.  But first, we gotta knock down this whole negative image around marijuana.  \n\nPeople think it's this terrible, evil drug, but it ain't like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop seein' it as this monster, folks might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Alright, so my church, it's totally changed up in the 21st century. Not as stiff and strict as it used to be, you know?  When I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards.  I went to this private school, and all my friends would be there too. We'd just hang out. Now, they've got these teenager masses, like a 30-minute version, and everyone's dressed way more casual.  Especially in summer, folks roll in straight from the beach, you know? Families running in late, the works!\n\nEven the morning masses, where I used to get all dressed up, are chill now. Jeans and khakis are the norm.  Khakis are cool, don't get me wrong, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest thing I've noticed about the church changing. I don't really know about the behind-the-scenes stuff, all the politics, but that's the vibe I'm getting. \n\n\nNow, about those scandals with priests and stuff... I don't think making priests married would have stopped it.  I mean, there are married guys who become pedophiles, right? It's not about being married or not. It's about the person. Maybe it's a choice they make when they become priests, who knows?\n\nThere are other religions where priests can get married, like the ones on TV shows. They're ministers or something. If they really want to be married and practice their faith, maybe they should check out a different church.\n\n\n\nI think it's kind of like genetics, you know? Like, some people are just born that way.  You can't really change that.  Maybe upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly genetics.  You can try to hide it, but it usually comes out in the end.  \n\nThe church might have screwed up by covering things up, but I don't think they could have stopped it from happening in all cases.",
            "(laughs) \n  Man, September 11th really messed things up. It's like the whole world went crazy. I mean, I was okay with the idea of going into Iraq at first, but it all felt so rushed and  tense. It's like the Bush crew used 9/11 as an excuse, a big red herring, to justify invading. They were spouting about Bin Laden and WMDs, but it all turned out to be a load of crap!  It just makes me so mad that they straight up lied to the American people. \n\n  Even Colin Powell, the guy who gave that whole big speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. C'mon, that's just plain wrong. It's a slap in the face to everyone who believed them, and it feels like a major betrayal of trust. It's like they think they're above the law, like they can just make things up and the public will believe them. \n\n  And don't even get me started on how they've been treating the Constitution. It's like they're trying to push it aside, destroy it piece by piece.  They came into office with war on their minds, and maybe even some dark, personal reasons. I heard this thing about the treasury secretary who basically called them out on it in his book.  He got kicked out, but it made you wonder.\n\n  It just feels like this whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would be a mess, probably cause more bloodshed and chaos. But putting other countries in charge? Doesn't sound good either. What about Iraq's sovereignty? It's already shaky, and things are falling apart in the government. \n\n  The parliament's a joke, the prime minister can't control anything, and these religious groups are playing power games. It's a recipe for disaster, honestly. It's like a giant, messed up game of musical chairs, and nobody knows who's going to be left standing in the end. \n\n (laughs) \n  I can't even begin to explain the whole thing without getting really angry.",
            "The Iraq War, man... it's a real head-scratcher. Feels pointless, you know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, a formal declaration and all that. Just this whole \"get back at Iraq\" thing 'cause they were blamed for 9/11. Not my scene, honestly. Not really into the whole thing.\n\nI don't keep up with the details, but it seems like we're stuck there trying to build democracy, make it more like the U.S., and grab some oil while we're at it. But it's causing so much unrest, and what's the point of staying forever? Building democracy takes time, forever even, and if we leave, they'll be furious 'cause we messed everything up and they're back to square one.\n\nUgh, this is tough. This is one topic I'm clueless about.  \n\nI guess I kinda want it to continue, though. Not because it's right, but because… it's like, we gotta show 'em we're strong, you know? We're America, we got the big guns. But it's not really a war anymore, not in the traditional sense. Congress never officially declared it, so…\n\nMaybe we should just help them out, try to rebuild. But it's also a waste of resources. And poor Bush, he's taking all the heat. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, a meaningless war that'll haunt him forever.\n\nI gotta think of the families with loved ones in Iraq. They want it to keep going so their kids come home safe. These people over there deserve better, they've lost everything.

            "Right, so, I just don't feel it's right for the government to get involved in this whole thing. It's like, the Constitution says separation of church and state, right?  It's plain as day. To me, trying to make laws about something like this feels like going against what's already been written.  \n\nIt's like, you've got all these different churches, all with their own beliefs, and some are okay with it, while others aren't. It's just picking sides, you know?  Forcing one church's view on everyone else. \n\nAnd the whole idea of making it illegal?  That just seems wrong. It's like trying to tell people what they can and can't believe.   Separation of church and state is a big deal in America, it's what lets people practice their religion freely.  \n\nAdding an amendment would be like going backwards. It's gotta be one of the few amendments that'd be used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nHonestly, I don't see any reason for the government to be involved at all. This whole push for an amendment just feels like it's coming from one guy's personal beliefs. He's basically saying that his religion's view is the only one that matters.  \n\nIt should be up to the churches to decide. Let them sort it out amongst themselves. It's not the government's place to interfere.",
            "The Iraq War, man... It's messed up. I don't think the government was straight with us about why we went in there. They tried to link it to 9/11, like it was all connected, but that just wasn't true. They played on our fear and anger after that terrible day, and suddenly we were invading Iraq in 2003.  \n\nLook, I'm against war, always have been. Especially preemptive strikes – that's just wrong. This whole thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, it's heartbreaking. They went in there, ripped out the government, and weren't ready for what came next. They didn't think about the chaos, the power vacuum.  \n\nThey tried to shove democracy in there, like it's some magic cure-all, just like they did in Vietnam. Pushing out Communists, trying to force democracy on a nation, it's a recipe for disaster. It's a long, hard road, not a quick victory. \n\nIt's like, even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there's always gonna be resistance. You can't just fight an army, you're fighting the people themselves. It's messy, it's tough, and it's not a clear-cut win. \n\nWe should have been more prepared. We should have known it wouldn't be easy.  They made it seem simple, but it's not.  Taking down a government and building something new takes time, years of struggle, just ask our own history! \n\nWe're still there in 2006, more American lives lost, training their troops, trying to hold things together. It's a mess, and I just hope it ends soon, for everyone's sake. But honestly, it feels like we're stuck in a quicksand of our own making.\n\nWe're talking about getting oil, right? Controlling resources. And what about those weapons of mass destruction we were told about? They never found any! But we're not even talking about North Korea, a country we know has them. It's all so shady. \n\n\n\nWe're stuck in this war, and I just hope it ends soon, but it feels like we're doing more harm than good.",

I live in a neighborhood where there are a couple of gay couples, you know, livin' their lives just like everyone else.  They walk their dogs, they go to the store, they're just tryin' to live their lives. It's not like they're hurtin' anyone.\n\nAnd this whole Bush thing, tryin' to play God and decide what marriage means? Ridiculous, I tell ya! It's like he's trying to rewrite the rules just because he doesn't understand.\n\nThere's all this talk now about how bein' gay might be somethin' you're born with, a chemical thing in your brain. It's not like you choose to be gay, any more than you choose your eye color. \n\nThe whole thing is just messed up. If a man and a woman want to get married, they don't need anyone's permission. But if two guys or two gals want to do the same thing, it's suddenly a national scandal. It's like they're tryin' to make it a bigger deal than it needs to be. It should be a private matter, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so here's the deal.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. You can't take it back, you know? As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nThink about it:  if you're posting about blowing stuff up or shooting people, someone's going to freak out.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's out there for the whole world to see.  If your friend sees it on Myspace, that's one thing. But if someone brings it to the school's attention, they have to take it seriously. They can't just ignore it, what if something actually happens?\n\nNow, I know some people just mess around online, but you never know. It could be a joke gone wrong, like that sociology experiment we had at school.  Or it could be something really serious.\n\nHere's what happened at our school: someone overheard someone else saying something scary, so they reported it. When they tracked down the person, they looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that seemed harmless at first, but in light of the situation, it became really concerning.\n\nThe bottom line? Once you put something online, it's out there. You can't control how people interpret it. You can't tell them what to think or what to take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you gave access to your stuff shared it with them.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles and friend their students. That's just creepy. It's not my place to know if my residents are out drinking and posting about it on Facebook. I don't want that connection.",
            "This war's been dragged on far too long, ya know?  At first, I thought the goal was legit - bringing democracy to a place that needed it.  But now?  It feels like we're just proving we're some kind of big-shot superpower, like we gotta flex our muscles.  Plus, there's all this talk about Bush Sr.'s beef with Saddam back in the day.  Makes you wonder if there's more to it than meets the eye.  If the goal was to give folks a fairer shot at a say in their government, that's a good thing.  But if it was just about settling old scores, well, that ain't right. \n\nLook, I get it, the first few months showed the world we weren't messing around.  But we've been at this for years now, and it just feels wrong.  It's like we're stuck in a rut, fighting for the sake of fighting, not for any clear purpose anymore.  We need a win, a clean break, something to show we actually accomplished something.\n\nWe gotta face facts: this thing's gone on too long.  Those folks gotta figure things out on their own eventually, right?  We've been pouring billions into this, money that could be used right here at home.  We got our own problems - poverty, schools, healthcare...  These are things that need our attention, not endless war.  It's a drain on our economy, a drain on our soul.  We can't keep sending our young people to fight a war that's lost its meaning.",
            "Okay, so there's this thing, right? Someone found out about, well, something someone else posted online, and that stopped something bad from happening.  I mean, on sites like Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  Like, yeah, you need a friend request or whatever, but you're kinda giving them permission when you accept it, right?  It's like, if you put it on the internet, you gotta be cool with people seeing it.  So I think it was actually good that someone spotted that and could help.\n\nBut then, it's a bit of a dilemma, you know? It's not like someone can watch everyone's profile all day.  And what if they start targeting \"bad kids\"?  That just feels wrong.  It's gotta be some kind of balance, right?  Like, were they looking for something specific, or did they just stumble across it by chance? \n\nPersonally, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook.  It freaks me out a little knowing there are creepy people who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV once about this guy who just showed how easy it was to find info on people.  He got this girl's screen name off her profile and started chatting with her on IM within a minute.  She met up with him! I wouldn't do that, obviously.\n\nI've had people in my classes message me on Facebook who I don't recognize.  They know it's me though, and it's weird.  They know your interests, what you look like, maybe even where you are during the day.  It's a lot of info, and I try to be careful about what I post, but then again, I want to be able to connect with friends.  It's a tough balance.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed strange to me.  Like, how can they tell students what they can and can't do online?  Maybe it's a privacy thing, but I don't know.  It just felt wrong.",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing...it's just a mess. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who were \"against it from the start,\" but I was. It's just that now, it's kinda like everyone agrees it was a bad idea except for the folks in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong. \n\nAnd honestly, look at the polls. They've done them everywhere, US, Iraq, even globally, and it's like 75-80% of the world thinks it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, even! And get this, a good chunk of the US troops over there think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's just been a disaster from day one. Even before we showed up, Iraq was messed up, and now this whole leaving thing is gonna be a disaster too.  There's no easy way out when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a huge cultural clash between us and those countries.  Our government just doesn't get it. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt about it. But you gotta weigh the pros and cons before invading a country and turning it into a giant quicksand pit.\n\nI don't even know what to say anymore. The only reason I can see for staying is what the administration thinks, but I haven't heard a single good reason that makes sense. If they wanna pull out gradually over a year or so, I could see that. But why stay any longer?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them think we should just leave now!  These are the people we're supposed to be helping, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, we can say \"Well, you guys made the call.\" Then, if things go south, we can step in and help, and maybe, just maybe, we'll be seen as the good guys. \n\nBut let's be real, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Okay, so like, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a huge thing in the US. It's not just about women, though. It's more like, it depends on what kind of work you do, ya know?  \n\nI mean, overall, it seems like women still have it rougher. There's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, dudes still have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages, you know? \n\nSo, women might see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just 'cause historically, women haven't been in those top positions. It's like they're stuck looking up at the top, but no one's letting them climb.\n\nAnd the same goes for guys, like in fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  It's super rare to see a dude staying home while his wife works.  People kinda judge them for it, like, \"Dude, you should be the breadwinner!\"  Even if it's what they really want,  society pushes back hard. \n\nAnd in fashion, it's kinda weird, right? People don't always take straight dudes seriously in that world. It's like they think they can't \"get\" fashion 'cause it's supposed to be a woman's thing.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's definitely still gender discrimination in the US, and it's different depending on what you do.  Changing it is tough because people are stuck in their ways. We've come a long way from the 1800s, but slow and steady, I guess. Women are getting more CEO jobs, and people are starting to accept stay-at-home dads more. \n\nIt's all about showing people the good qualities of those who are often stereotyped. If you push too hard, people resist. We gotta be patient, I guess. Change takes time.",
            "Right, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They made it so it's not a criminal offense anymore. More like a parking ticket, you get cited instead of getting thrown in jail.  I mean,  it still hangs over ya, especially when you're lookin' for a job or whatever.  Those  ramifications, like the worst parts of a drug charge, well, they don't exactly disappear just 'cause it's decriminalized. \n\nBut, think about it, arresting folks, booking 'em, housing 'em, court dates, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all costs a bundle. A whole lotta dough.  Especially for places that are struggling financially. Some places, they're just dead set against it, even if it'd save 'em money. \n\nBut in cities like Denver, where folks are a bit more... open-minded, ya know? More liberal,  it makes sense to me.  They probably have a lot more dough now for schools, helpin' old folks, feedin' the homeless.  It's a win-win, right?\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' we should be handin' out joints like candy.  There's a reason it's still a bit taboo.  But financially, it's gotta be a factor. \n\nIf it was fully legal, imagine it everywhere, like cigarettes. Gas stations, cars, everywhere.  Folks gettin' high and drivin'?  That ain't right.\n\nAnd besides, society ain't quite ready for that kinda openness, ya know?\n\nIt's like with alcohol, it messes with your coordination, but marijuana, it messes with your whole life, ya know? They both have their downsides, but everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, others... not so much.",
            "So, about Catholicism... I mean, there's a lot to like. They've got traditions that have stood the test of time, which is cool. It's good to have roots, right? But, at the same time, you've gotta be able to adapt and change with the times. \n\nThe thing is, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church is stuck in the past. They're super strict about how things are done, and honestly, it can feel kinda judgmental towards people who don't follow the rules perfectly. Like, what about people who aren't, you know, *perfect* Catholics? Or people who practice different religions?\n\nMy dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but they wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of his religion.  That doesn't seem very loving or accepting, does it?  They preach about loving everyone but then turn around and exclude people who aren't exactly like them. It's kinda hypocritical, if you ask me.\n\nYou see, a lot of Catholic teaching is about doing good things, but then their practices don't always line up with that.  It's like they're clinging to outdated traditions even though they don't really make sense anymore.\n\nNow, about those priests who... well, you know...  I think it would be good if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing those bad things. It's a separate issue, really.\n\nI mean, people who hurt children are going to hurt children, whether they're married or not.  It's just a different kind of wrong.  Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve that problem.",
            "So, I'm kinda stuck on this whole marriage thing.  It's a real head-scratcher, ya know?  Like, where do you draw the line between church and state?  And what even *is* marriage, anyway?  It's a tough one because it feels like no matter what you say, someone's gonna get their knickers in a twist.\n\nI'm thinking maybe all these unions, whether they're called \"marriage\" or \"civil union,\" should be treated the same.  I mean, why should the government care *how* you define it, as long as it's between two consenting adults?  It's like, wouldn't it be kinda weird if the government decided to recognize baptisms or other religious stuff?  Just let people love who they love, right?\n\nAs for gay marriage, I think if states can figure out a way to make it work, then cool, let's make it federal law.  But changing the Constitution just to ban it?  That's just plain bonkers.  It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but is it *that* big of a deal to amend the Constitution over?\n\nHonestly, it just feels kinda pointless.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a complicated issue for me. \n\nSee, I have lots of gay friends, so I can't just brush it off. I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to choose who they love. \n\nThis whole thing shouldn't be a national debate, though. Each state should decide for themselves if they want to legalize gay marriage.  \n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, like California or New York, while others are more conservative, like Texas or Alabama. \n\nIf you live in a state where gay marriage is legal, well, that's just how it is there. You're basically agreeing to those rules when you move there.  \n\nLook, I think everyone deserves equal opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I'm all for legalization, but let each state make that call. \n\nIt's not right for the president to impose his views on the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide what's best for them. \n\nBesides, Bush is leaving office soon anyway.  What's the point of fighting over this when a new president could change everything in a heartbeat? \n\nLet the states figure it out, that's what I say. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Listen, I get it. Myspace is like a public billboard, right?  If you put something up there, it's basically for everyone to see, teachers included.  I mean, even if they're not using the school's name, they can still check it out from home.  It's like, if you're posting something you don't want people to see, maybe don't post it online at all. \n\nNow, I get that some people think it's a privacy invasion if they're just snooping around looking for students doing dumb stuff.  But if they see something that could prevent a shooting, or keep kids safe, well, that seems pretty important to me.  It's like, the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe, and if that means checking Myspace, so be it.\n\nThink about it: if schools are checking email, why not Myspace?  They're just trying to make sure everyone's safe, and if that means looking at what people are posting online, well, it's kind of a necessary evil, right?",
            "Okay, so, about the war...  It all started after 9/11. I was right there in the thick of it, personally affected, and fueled by anger.  I was all for going over there and dishing out some serious payback. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. It was a knee-jerk reaction,  a bit impulsive. We rushed into things without a solid plan, and honestly, it backfired spectacularly.  \n\nI mean, I used to be all for it, but now?  I'm against it completely. I don't see any real progress, any positive outcome. The people over there, they're constantly fighting amongst themselves.  How can we expect them to focus on us when they can't even get along? It feels like we're just stirring the pot, creating more chaos. \n\nTo be honest, 9/11 changed things for me. I've almost become numb to what's going on there. I just don't care anymore. They're fighting, they're killing each other, it's a vicious cycle. They seem so different from us, so savage in their approach to war. I don't think they're trying to build a better future, just trying to push us out. Maybe that's what they want, and maybe we should just give it to them.\n\nWe went in there unprepared, with no clear idea of what we were facing. War is different for them, way more brutal. We  were blinded by revenge, fueled by the need for justice after 9/11. President Bush, well, he felt the pressure from the people, wanted to act tough.  I understand where he was coming from, but maybe declaring war on Iraq was a mistake.  \n\nWe should have had a better plan, a clearer purpose. There wasn't enough unity, everyone was just reacting instead of thinking. It all felt emotional, not strategic.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we were ever meant to change those people. They're stuck in their ways, and no amount of force will break that cycle. It's time to admit we've made a mess of things and just leave.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying. They'll just fall back into chaos once we withdraw, and we can't keep throwing our lives away trying to fix it. We need to let go."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so here's the deal, I think the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly cool with a lot of stuff.  They're super against things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  And while they're entitled to their views, they're kinda stuck in the past, ya know? \n\nI feel like if they loosened up a bit, maybe embraced some newer ideas, they wouldn't be so worried about people leaving.  I've been hearing that folks are starting to ditch the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nLike, if you're pro-choice, you're probably not gonna feel comfy in a place that says abortion is totally wrong. Or if you're all about gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't support it.  \n\nIt just seems like a bit of a clash.\n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests or priests who are married?  It's not like it would hurt anything.  I don't know if it would have stopped all the bad stuff that's happened, but it's something to think about.\n\nIt's just weird to me that priests are supposed to be \"married to God,\" but they can't have families or spouses.  Everyone else gets to have both their job and their personal life.  Why not priests?",
            "Okay, so, um, me personally? I'm cool with gay marriage.  Like, I don't think it's some kinda choice people make, you know? I mean, some folks are born that way, just like some folks are born straight. It's kinda like you can't pick your hair color, right? So, it seems wrong to say, \"Oh, a man and a woman can get married, but two dudes or two gals can't.\" That just doesn't sit right with me.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems unfair. It's not like they're choosing to be gay, it's just who they are. I was born straight, but I wouldn't want someone telling me I couldn't get married because of that, y'know? So, yeah, I think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it affects national security or anything. It's just people's personal lives. I don't think it's a moral issue either.  \n\nIt's just weird to me that people would make such a big deal out of it. Like, they're not hurting anyone. It's not their fault how they feel. They shouldn't have to hide who they are or be ashamed of it. They should be able to love who they love, just like everyone else.",
            "Alright, listen up, here's the deal with gay marriage. It's a no-brainer, really. There's just no solid reason to keep it illegal.\n\nSome folks say gay couples are a threat to the traditional family, but come on, it's totally different. Think of it like two sides of the same coin – different, but still the same essential thing.\n\nAnd it's not just about love; there's a whole heap of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick 'cause they're not legally family.  It's crazy!  If you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?\n\nPlus, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about the relationship, the connection, the love – not the gender of the people involved.\n\nLet's be real, it's not about church weddings. Gay couples are just asking for a government-recognized marriage certificate, a legal document.  \n\nIt's like saying one type of love is more valid than another. If you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage? It's all about equality.\n\nAnd yeah, there are concerns about kids and adoption, but those are just fears based on ignorance. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples.  \n\nLook, I get that some people have strong religious beliefs, but the government shouldn't be making laws based on religion. That's not fair to everyone else. It's like saying only one group's morality matters.  \n\nIt's hypocritcal, considering the government itself is founded on the idea of separation of church and state.\n\nThe bottom line is, gay people deserve the same rights and respect as everyone else.  It's time to stop judging and start embracing love in all its forms.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin'. I work in a hospital pharmacy, see, and lemme just say, just 'cause somethin's illegal don't mean it ain't got some good uses.  I mean, should we just make it easy for everyone to get their hands on it? Nah, not a chance. But for medicinal purposes?  Absolutely!  Cause listen, just 'cause somethin's against the law don't mean it ain't got some good stuff going for it.  \n\nThink about it, there are a bunch of drugs pharmacies use that are totally illegal on the street, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet – they're all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they help people.  So why are we denying folks the potential benefits of marijuana just 'cause there's this whole stigma around it? \n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's exactly like alcohol, 'cause abusin' either one can lead to trouble.  It's a tricky situation, but I reckon we could ease into it – make it legal gradually, not all at once.  Otherwise, people might go overboard.  But first, we gotta knock down this whole negative image around marijuana.  \n\nPeople think it's this terrible, evil drug, but it ain't like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop seein' it as this monster, folks might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Alright, so my church, it's totally changed up in the 21st century. Not as stiff and strict as it used to be, you know?  When I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards.  I went to this private school, and all my friends would be there too. We'd just hang out. Now, they've got these teenager masses, like a 30-minute version, and everyone's dressed way more casual.  Especially in summer, folks roll in straight from the beach, you know? Families running in late, the works!\n\nEven the morning masses, where I used to get all dressed up, are chill now. Jeans and khakis are the norm.  Khakis are cool, don't get me wrong, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest thing I've noticed about the church changing. I don't really know about the behind-the-scenes stuff, all the politics, but that's the vibe I'm getting. \n\n\nNow, about those scandals with priests and stuff... I don't think making priests married would have stopped it.  I mean, there are married guys who become pedophiles, right? It's not about being married or not. It's about the person. Maybe it's a choice they make when they become priests, who knows?\n\nThere are other religions where priests can get married, like the ones on TV shows. They're ministers or something. If they really want to be married and practice their faith, maybe they should check out a different church.\n\n\n\nI think it's kind of like genetics, you know? Like, some people are just born that way.  You can't really change that.  Maybe upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly genetics.  You can try to hide it, but it usually comes out in the end.  \n\nThe church might have screwed up by covering things up, but I don't think they could have stopped it from happening in all cases.",
            "(laughs) \n  Man, September 11th really messed things up. It's like the whole world went crazy. I mean, I was okay with the idea of going into Iraq at first, but it all felt so rushed and  tense. It's like the Bush crew used 9/11 as an excuse, a big red herring, to justify invading. They were spouting about Bin Laden and WMDs, but it all turned out to be a load of crap!  It just makes me so mad that they straight up lied to the American people. \n\n  Even Colin Powell, the guy who gave that whole big speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. C'mon, that's just plain wrong. It's a slap in the face to everyone who believed them, and it feels like a major betrayal of trust. It's like they think they're above the law, like they can just make things up and the public will believe them. \n\n  And don't even get me started on how they've been treating the Constitution. It's like they're trying to push it aside, destroy it piece by piece.  They came into office with war on their minds, and maybe even some dark, personal reasons. I heard this thing about the treasury secretary who basically called them out on it in his book.  He got kicked out, but it made you wonder.\n\n  It just feels like this whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would be a mess, probably cause more bloodshed and chaos. But putting other countries in charge? Doesn't sound good either. What about Iraq's sovereignty? It's already shaky, and things are falling apart in the government. \n\n  The parliament's a joke, the prime minister can't control anything, and these religious groups are playing power games. It's a recipe for disaster, honestly. It's like a giant, messed up game of musical chairs, and nobody knows who's going to be left standing in the end. \n\n (laughs) \n  I can't even begin to explain the whole thing without getting really angry.",
            "The Iraq War, man... it's a real head-scratcher. Feels pointless, you know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, a formal declaration and all that. Just this whole \"get back at Iraq\" thing 'cause they were blamed for 9/11. Not my scene, honestly. Not really into the whole thing.\n\nI don't keep up with the details, but it seems like we're stuck there trying to build democracy, make it more like the U.S., and grab some oil while we're at it. But it's causing so much unrest, and what's the point of staying forever? Building democracy takes time, forever even, and if we leave, they'll be furious 'cause we messed everything up and they're back to square one.\n\nUgh, this is tough. This is one topic I'm clueless about.  \n\nI guess I kinda want it to continue, though. Not because it's right, but because… it's like, we gotta show 'em we're strong, you know? We're America, we got the big guns. But it's not really a war anymore, not in the traditional sense. Congress never officially declared it, so…\n\nMaybe we should just help them out, try to rebuild. But it's also a waste of resources. And poor Bush, he's taking all the heat. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, a meaningless war that'll haunt him forever.\n\nI gotta think of the families with loved ones in Iraq. They want it to keep going so their kids come home safe. These people over there deserve better, they've lost everything.

            "Right, so, I just don't feel it's right for the government to get involved in this whole thing. It's like, the Constitution says separation of church and state, right?  It's plain as day. To me, trying to make laws about something like this feels like going against what's already been written.  \n\nIt's like, you've got all these different churches, all with their own beliefs, and some are okay with it, while others aren't. It's just picking sides, you know?  Forcing one church's view on everyone else. \n\nAnd the whole idea of making it illegal?  That just seems wrong. It's like trying to tell people what they can and can't believe.   Separation of church and state is a big deal in America, it's what lets people practice their religion freely.  \n\nAdding an amendment would be like going backwards. It's gotta be one of the few amendments that'd be used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nHonestly, I don't see any reason for the government to be involved at all. This whole push for an amendment just feels like it's coming from one guy's personal beliefs. He's basically saying that his religion's view is the only one that matters.  \n\nIt should be up to the churches to decide. Let them sort it out amongst themselves. It's not the government's place to interfere.",
            "The Iraq War, man... It's messed up. I don't think the government was straight with us about why we went in there. They tried to link it to 9/11, like it was all connected, but that just wasn't true. They played on our fear and anger after that terrible day, and suddenly we were invading Iraq in 2003.  \n\nLook, I'm against war, always have been. Especially preemptive strikes – that's just wrong. This whole thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, it's heartbreaking. They went in there, ripped out the government, and weren't ready for what came next. They didn't think about the chaos, the power vacuum.  \n\nThey tried to shove democracy in there, like it's some magic cure-all, just like they did in Vietnam. Pushing out Communists, trying to force democracy on a nation, it's a recipe for disaster. It's a long, hard road, not a quick victory. \n\nIt's like, even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there's always gonna be resistance. You can't just fight an army, you're fighting the people themselves. It's messy, it's tough, and it's not a clear-cut win. \n\nWe should have been more prepared. We should have known it wouldn't be easy.  They made it seem simple, but it's not.  Taking down a government and building something new takes time, years of struggle, just ask our own history! \n\nWe're still there in 2006, more American lives lost, training their troops, trying to hold things together. It's a mess, and I just hope it ends soon, for everyone's sake. But honestly, it feels like we're stuck in a quicksand of our own making.\n\nWe're talking about getting oil, right? Controlling resources. And what about those weapons of mass destruction we were told about? They never found any! But we're not even talking about North Korea, a country we know has them. It's all so shady. \n\n\n\nWe're stuck in this war, and I just hope it ends soon, but it feels like we're doing more harm than good.",

I live in a neighborhood where there are a couple of gay couples, you know, livin' their lives just like everyone else.  They walk their dogs, they go to the store, they're just tryin' to live their lives. It's not like they're hurtin' anyone.\n\nAnd this whole Bush thing, tryin' to play God and decide what marriage means? Ridiculous, I tell ya! It's like he's trying to rewrite the rules just because he doesn't understand.\n\nThere's all this talk now about how bein' gay might be somethin' you're born with, a chemical thing in your brain. It's not like you choose to be gay, any more than you choose your eye color. \n\nThe whole thing is just messed up. If a man and a woman want to get married, they don't need anyone's permission. But if two guys or two gals want to do the same thing, it's suddenly a national scandal. It's like they're tryin' to make it a bigger deal than it needs to be. It should be a private matter, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so here's the deal.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. You can't take it back, you know? As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nThink about it:  if you're posting about blowing stuff up or shooting people, someone's going to freak out.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's out there for the whole world to see.  If your friend sees it on Myspace, that's one thing. But if someone brings it to the school's attention, they have to take it seriously. They can't just ignore it, what if something actually happens?\n\nNow, I know some people just mess around online, but you never know. It could be a joke gone wrong, like that sociology experiment we had at school.  Or it could be something really serious.\n\nHere's what happened at our school: someone overheard someone else saying something scary, so they reported it. When they tracked down the person, they looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that seemed harmless at first, but in light of the situation, it became really concerning.\n\nThe bottom line? Once you put something online, it's out there. You can't control how people interpret it. You can't tell them what to think or what to take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you gave access to your stuff shared it with them.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles and friend their students. That's just creepy. It's not my place to know if my residents are out drinking and posting about it on Facebook. I don't want that connection.",
            "This war's been dragged on far too long, ya know?  At first, I thought the goal was legit - bringing democracy to a place that needed it.  But now?  It feels like we're just proving we're some kind of big-shot superpower, like we gotta flex our muscles.  Plus, there's all this talk about Bush Sr.'s beef with Saddam back in the day.  Makes you wonder if there's more to it than meets the eye.  If the goal was to give folks a fairer shot at a say in their government, that's a good thing.  But if it was just about settling old scores, well, that ain't right. \n\nLook, I get it, the first few months showed the world we weren't messing around.  But we've been at this for years now, and it just feels wrong.  It's like we're stuck in a rut, fighting for the sake of fighting, not for any clear purpose anymore.  We need a win, a clean break, something to show we actually accomplished something.\n\nWe gotta face facts: this thing's gone on too long.  Those folks gotta figure things out on their own eventually, right?  We've been pouring billions into this, money that could be used right here at home.  We got our own problems - poverty, schools, healthcare...  These are things that need our attention, not endless war.  It's a drain on our economy, a drain on our soul.  We can't keep sending our young people to fight a war that's lost its meaning.",
            "Okay, so there's this thing, right? Someone found out about, well, something someone else posted online, and that stopped something bad from happening.  I mean, on sites like Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  Like, yeah, you need a friend request or whatever, but you're kinda giving them permission when you accept it, right?  It's like, if you put it on the internet, you gotta be cool with people seeing it.  So I think it was actually good that someone spotted that and could help.\n\nBut then, it's a bit of a dilemma, you know? It's not like someone can watch everyone's profile all day.  And what if they start targeting \"bad kids\"?  That just feels wrong.  It's gotta be some kind of balance, right?  Like, were they looking for something specific, or did they just stumble across it by chance? \n\nPersonally, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook.  It freaks me out a little knowing there are creepy people who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV once about this guy who just showed how easy it was to find info on people.  He got this girl's screen name off her profile and started chatting with her on IM within a minute.  She met up with him! I wouldn't do that, obviously.\n\nI've had people in my classes message me on Facebook who I don't recognize.  They know it's me though, and it's weird.  They know your interests, what you look like, maybe even where you are during the day.  It's a lot of info, and I try to be careful about what I post, but then again, I want to be able to connect with friends.  It's a tough balance.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed strange to me.  Like, how can they tell students what they can and can't do online?  Maybe it's a privacy thing, but I don't know.  It just felt wrong.",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing...it's just a mess. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who were \"against it from the start,\" but I was. It's just that now, it's kinda like everyone agrees it was a bad idea except for the folks in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong. \n\nAnd honestly, look at the polls. They've done them everywhere, US, Iraq, even globally, and it's like 75-80% of the world thinks it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, even! And get this, a good chunk of the US troops over there think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's just been a disaster from day one. Even before we showed up, Iraq was messed up, and now this whole leaving thing is gonna be a disaster too.  There's no easy way out when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a huge cultural clash between us and those countries.  Our government just doesn't get it. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt about it. But you gotta weigh the pros and cons before invading a country and turning it into a giant quicksand pit.\n\nI don't even know what to say anymore. The only reason I can see for staying is what the administration thinks, but I haven't heard a single good reason that makes sense. If they wanna pull out gradually over a year or so, I could see that. But why stay any longer?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them think we should just leave now!  These are the people we're supposed to be helping, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, we can say \"Well, you guys made the call.\" Then, if things go south, we can step in and help, and maybe, just maybe, we'll be seen as the good guys. \n\nBut let's be real, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Okay, so like, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a huge thing in the US. It's not just about women, though. It's more like, it depends on what kind of work you do, ya know?  \n\nI mean, overall, it seems like women still have it rougher. There's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, dudes still have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages, you know? \n\nSo, women might see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just 'cause historically, women haven't been in those top positions. It's like they're stuck looking up at the top, but no one's letting them climb.\n\nAnd the same goes for guys, like in fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  It's super rare to see a dude staying home while his wife works.  People kinda judge them for it, like, \"Dude, you should be the breadwinner!\"  Even if it's what they really want,  society pushes back hard. \n\nAnd in fashion, it's kinda weird, right? People don't always take straight dudes seriously in that world. It's like they think they can't \"get\" fashion 'cause it's supposed to be a woman's thing.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's definitely still gender discrimination in the US, and it's different depending on what you do.  Changing it is tough because people are stuck in their ways. We've come a long way from the 1800s, but slow and steady, I guess. Women are getting more CEO jobs, and people are starting to accept stay-at-home dads more. \n\nIt's all about showing people the good qualities of those who are often stereotyped. If you push too hard, people resist. We gotta be patient, I guess. Change takes time.",
            "Right, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They made it so it's not a criminal offense anymore. More like a parking ticket, you get cited instead of getting thrown in jail.  I mean,  it still hangs over ya, especially when you're lookin' for a job or whatever.  Those  ramifications, like the worst parts of a drug charge, well, they don't exactly disappear just 'cause it's decriminalized. \n\nBut, think about it, arresting folks, booking 'em, housing 'em, court dates, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all costs a bundle. A whole lotta dough.  Especially for places that are struggling financially. Some places, they're just dead set against it, even if it'd save 'em money. \n\nBut in cities like Denver, where folks are a bit more... open-minded, ya know? More liberal,  it makes sense to me.  They probably have a lot more dough now for schools, helpin' old folks, feedin' the homeless.  It's a win-win, right?\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' we should be handin' out joints like candy.  There's a reason it's still a bit taboo.  But financially, it's gotta be a factor. \n\nIf it was fully legal, imagine it everywhere, like cigarettes. Gas stations, cars, everywhere.  Folks gettin' high and drivin'?  That ain't right.\n\nAnd besides, society ain't quite ready for that kinda openness, ya know?\n\nIt's like with alcohol, it messes with your coordination, but marijuana, it messes with your whole life, ya know? They both have their downsides, but everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, others... not so much.",
            "So, about Catholicism... I mean, there's a lot to like. They've got traditions that have stood the test of time, which is cool. It's good to have roots, right? But, at the same time, you've gotta be able to adapt and change with the times. \n\nThe thing is, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church is stuck in the past. They're super strict about how things are done, and honestly, it can feel kinda judgmental towards people who don't follow the rules perfectly. Like, what about people who aren't, you know, *perfect* Catholics? Or people who practice different religions?\n\nMy dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but they wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of his religion.  That doesn't seem very loving or accepting, does it?  They preach about loving everyone but then turn around and exclude people who aren't exactly like them. It's kinda hypocritical, if you ask me.\n\nYou see, a lot of Catholic teaching is about doing good things, but then their practices don't always line up with that.  It's like they're clinging to outdated traditions even though they don't really make sense anymore.\n\nNow, about those priests who... well, you know...  I think it would be good if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing those bad things. It's a separate issue, really.\n\nI mean, people who hurt children are going to hurt children, whether they're married or not.  It's just a different kind of wrong.  Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve that problem.",
            "So, I'm kinda stuck on this whole marriage thing.  It's a real head-scratcher, ya know?  Like, where do you draw the line between church and state?  And what even *is* marriage, anyway?  It's a tough one because it feels like no matter what you say, someone's gonna get their knickers in a twist.\n\nI'm thinking maybe all these unions, whether they're called \"marriage\" or \"civil union,\" should be treated the same.  I mean, why should the government care *how* you define it, as long as it's between two consenting adults?  It's like, wouldn't it be kinda weird if the government decided to recognize baptisms or other religious stuff?  Just let people love who they love, right?\n\nAs for gay marriage, I think if states can figure out a way to make it work, then cool, let's make it federal law.  But changing the Constitution just to ban it?  That's just plain bonkers.  It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but is it *that* big of a deal to amend the Constitution over?\n\nHonestly, it just feels kinda pointless.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a complicated issue for me. \n\nSee, I have lots of gay friends, so I can't just brush it off. I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to choose who they love. \n\nThis whole thing shouldn't be a national debate, though. Each state should decide for themselves if they want to legalize gay marriage.  \n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, like California or New York, while others are more conservative, like Texas or Alabama. \n\nIf you live in a state where gay marriage is legal, well, that's just how it is there. You're basically agreeing to those rules when you move there.  \n\nLook, I think everyone deserves equal opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I'm all for legalization, but let each state make that call. \n\nIt's not right for the president to impose his views on the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide what's best for them. \n\nBesides, Bush is leaving office soon anyway.  What's the point of fighting over this when a new president could change everything in a heartbeat? \n\nLet the states figure it out, that's what I say. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Listen, I get it. Myspace is like a public billboard, right?  If you put something up there, it's basically for everyone to see, teachers included.  I mean, even if they're not using the school's name, they can still check it out from home.  It's like, if you're posting something you don't want people to see, maybe don't post it online at all. \n\nNow, I get that some people think it's a privacy invasion if they're just snooping around looking for students doing dumb stuff.  But if they see something that could prevent a shooting, or keep kids safe, well, that seems pretty important to me.  It's like, the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe, and if that means checking Myspace, so be it.\n\nThink about it: if schools are checking email, why not Myspace?  They're just trying to make sure everyone's safe, and if that means looking at what people are posting online, well, it's kind of a necessary evil, right?",
            "Okay, so, about the war...  It all started after 9/11. I was right there in the thick of it, personally affected, and fueled by anger.  I was all for going over there and dishing out some serious payback. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. It was a knee-jerk reaction,  a bit impulsive. We rushed into things without a solid plan, and honestly, it backfired spectacularly.  \n\nI mean, I used to be all for it, but now?  I'm against it completely. I don't see any real progress, any positive outcome. The people over there, they're constantly fighting amongst themselves.  How can we expect them to focus on us when they can't even get along? It feels like we're just stirring the pot, creating more chaos. \n\nTo be honest, 9/11 changed things for me. I've almost become numb to what's going on there. I just don't care anymore. They're fighting, they're killing each other, it's a vicious cycle. They seem so different from us, so savage in their approach to war. I don't think they're trying to build a better future, just trying to push us out. Maybe that's what they want, and maybe we should just give it to them.\n\nWe went in there unprepared, with no clear idea of what we were facing. War is different for them, way more brutal. We  were blinded by revenge, fueled by the need for justice after 9/11. President Bush, well, he felt the pressure from the people, wanted to act tough.  I understand where he was coming from, but maybe declaring war on Iraq was a mistake.  \n\nWe should have had a better plan, a clearer purpose. There wasn't enough unity, everyone was just reacting instead of thinking. It all felt emotional, not strategic.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we were ever meant to change those people. They're stuck in their ways, and no amount of force will break that cycle. It's time to admit we've made a mess of things and just leave.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying. They'll just fall back into chaos once we withdraw, and we can't keep throwing our lives away trying to fix it. We need to let go."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church could really use a bit of an update, ya know?  \n\nThey've been going on about how they're losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not super accepting of, well, a lot of stuff. Like, take gay marriage, abortion, birth control - those are biggies. They've got these super strong opinions about 'em, which is cool, but some of it feels a bit stuck in the past, ya know?  \n\nI've heard that a lot of people are starting to ditch the church 'cause they don't agree with their views on these things.  They just feel like the Church is on the wrong side of things. \n\nLike, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a church that says it's completely wrong.  Same deal with gay marriage, if that's something you support, you might not wanna be in a church that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or married priests.  But I'm not sure if that would've stopped all the bad stuff that's gone down. \n\nIt's tough to say, right? Maybe they would have done things differently if they could've gotten married or had women priests, but who knows? \n\nI just think it's weird that priests are supposed to be devoted to God but can't have regular lives with families like everyone else.  They're human too!",
            "Alright, so, like, gay marriage, huh? I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like a choice you make on purpose, right? So, gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are, you know? It's messed up to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but yeah, it seems wrong to me. Like, it's not a choice, you're just born that way. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, right? It's not something you pick, so you shouldn't be punished for it, if you get what I mean.\n\n(clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it's not really a legal thing, or even really a moral issue, you know? I mean, gay people shouldn't be put on trial or anything, like they made a wrong choice.\n\nIt's not the government's business, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nIt's tough to explain, but, like, it's not about security or morals or anything. It's just people's lives, and they should be able to live how they want. They shouldn't be punished for who they are. That's just how they were born, and that's okay.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage, you know?  It just seems like there's no good reason to say no.  People worry that it'll mess up traditional families, but honestly, it's like comparing apples and oranges.  They're different, but both relationships are, like, the same thing under the surface. It's just love, right?\n\nThere's a ton of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the hospital room with you if you're sick!  It's crazy because they're not considered family.  And who else would you want there if you're really sick?\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of research showing that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work. It's all about the connection, you know?\n\nWhat really gets me is that people think this is about churches getting involved. It's not! Gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document from the government.  The church and the state should be separate, right?\n\nAnd it's like, if you're okay with civil unions, why not just go all the way with marriage? It's the same thing, just with a different name.  It's like segregation, but for love.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how it will affect kids, but honestly, it's just about being a good parent.  Gay couples can be just as loving and caring as straight couples.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes kids get bullied or treated differently because their parents are gay. It's sad, but it happens.\n\nI think the government should definitely get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It shouldn't be up to each state to decide. \n\nThe whole thing makes me mad, especially when you hear people saying it goes against their religion.  It's like, how can they decide what's right for everyone else based on their beliefs? \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the idea that being gay is a choice or a problem. That's just not true! The American Psychological Association has said that being gay is normal and healthy. People just need to open their minds and hearts to the truth.",
            "Listen, I work the pharmacy counter at a hospital, see?  Just 'cause a medicine ain't legal doesn't mean it's all bad, y'know?  I mean, should folks be able to just walk in and grab it? Nope, not a chance. But if it can help someone, I'm all for it.  I mean, a medicine's not evil just 'cause it's outlawed, right?\n\nThink about it: we use stuff like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet in the pharmacy all the time. They're super strong, controlled, but they help folks feel better. So why slam the door on weed just 'cause it's got a bad rap?  Embrace the good parts, right?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's exactly like booze.  Both can be messy if you overdo it, but...  It's a tough call. Maybe ease into it, you know? Make it legal bit by bit, not all at once.  Gotta break down that wall of fear around weed first.  Then folks might treat it with respect, not like some devilish demon.\n\nPeople freak out 'cause it's illegal, but c'mon,  it ain't heroin or coke. It ain't that bad for you.  If we ditch the scary stories, maybe folks'll use it smart, especially for when they're sick.",
            "Y'know, I feel like the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be,  not even close.  When I was a kid, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd rock the cutest dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards!  We went to a private school, so all my friends were there too, every single weekend.  But now things are different. They've got this \"teenager mass\", all thirty minutes long, and people dress way more casual.  Especially in the summer, you'd see folks in their beach gear, straight from the sand! Families would rush in late, no biggie.  Even the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, now folks are rocking jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are fine, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As far as the church itself goes, that's all I really know. I don't get into the church politics or anything like that.\n\nSpeaking of politics, I heard about all the nasty stuff going on with priests and kids.  It makes me sick. Do you think things would have been different if the church allowed female priests or let priests get married?\n\nI don't think so. Some married guys become pedophiles anyway, they've got that urge no matter what.  I think it's something inside them, not about being married or not.  And choosing to become a priest is their own decision.  There are other religions where priests can get married, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\". They're ministers or whatever, but they can have families. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nI think it's all about genetics, like, some folks are just born with those urges. You can't change that with marriage, it might hide it for a while, but it'll probably come out eventually.  I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening, but if they knew and covered it up, shame on them!",
            "(laughs) \nMan, that whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil.  I mean, at first, I wasn't totally against the idea, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we were jumping into a war based on some pretty shaky pretexts. The Bush administration kept linking Iraq to Bin Laden and those 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We all know now that was a load of crap.  \n\nI just can't stand how the Bush guys flat out lied to the American people. It's like they have zero respect for the truth, and even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. That's malfeasance, plain and simple.  An impeachable offense, if you ask me.  \n\nIt feels like they came into office with a war on their minds, wanting to make a statement. There was even talk, after that Secretary of the Treasury guy got kicked out, about how younger Bush had a personal grudge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad.  I mean, what a mess.  And let's not forget about the whole energy thing - like it's all about securing oil, y'know?  Pretty slimy. \n\nLook, it's gone on for way too long.  Pulling out now would be a disaster, though.  Iraq could easily spiral into civil war, and even more people would die. The UN is trying to put together some kind of coalition from the region - Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing - but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's gonna mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and we're already seeing problems with the government. The Parliament is a joke, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to be in control.  And then there's al-Sadr and all those other factions fighting for power. It's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)",
            "You know, this whole War in Iraq thing, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, like we just went in there because we thought Iraq was behind 9/11, you know?  I'm not one to get all worked up about war stuff, but it just doesn't sit right with me.  We're supposedly there to build democracy and grab some oil, but honestly, it's making everyone miserable.  Trying to force democracy on a place that's not ready for it is like trying to teach a toddler calculus.  It just ain't gonna happen overnight.  And if we leave, they'll probably blame us for messing everything up. It's a real catch-22.\n\nI feel bad for Bush, too. This whole thing is making him look like one of those presidents people remember for all the wrong reasons, like the Vietnam War president.  It's heavy stuff.\n\nOf course, there are those families with loved ones over there, and I don't want them to be stuck in danger. But at the same time, I just feel like we're not helping them.  We're changing their culture, forcing our way of life on them. That's just gonna make things worse.\n\nThis whole thing is a mess, and I don't think there's an easy solution. It feels like it's gonna drag on for years and years, and I just hope it doesn't make things even worse in the end.",
            "Ugh, it just feels wrong to think about the government making something legal or illegal, especially something like this. It's all about the separation of church and state, right? The Constitution is super clear about that – it's right there in black and white.  Trying to push laws on this stuff feels like going against what's already been decided.\n\nPlus, it's like picking one church's beliefs over another's. Most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in a few places like Boston.  Shouldn't it be up to the churches themselves to decide?  \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal in the US, it's all about letting people practice their religions freely. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It goes against what's already in the Constitution, and it'd be weird – it's one of the few amendments that would restrict people instead of the government.\n\nHonestly, the government shouldn't be involved at all.  This guy pushing for it just seems like he wants to enforce his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It's not fair to favor one religion over others. This is something the churches should decide, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to ban it, it doesn't hurt the economy or anything else – it might even make things better.",
            "The whole Iraq war is just a mess, you know? Right from the start, I don't think the government was straight with us about why they wanted to invade. They tried to tie it all to 9/11, making it seem like Iraq was behind it, but that just wasn't true. They used our anger and fear after 9/11 to push us into war, and it all started back in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike, and this whole thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from the mistakes we made there. We've lost so many good American soldiers, and for what? They went in, overthrew the Iraqi government, didn't have a plan for what to do next, and now look at the chaos. It's like they thought they could just drop in, install a democracy, and everything would be sunshine and rainbows.  \n\nThey're trying to do the same thing they did in Vietnam, pushing their idea of democracy onto a country that wasn't ready for it. It's a tough fight, especially when you're not fighting a regular army, but the people themselves. You can't just conquer a country and expect everyone to be happy about it. \n\nThe government didn't plan for the aftermath. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the violence, the rebuilding. We're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, trying to train the Iraqi army and police. It's a long, hard process, and I don't think the US government was honest with the American people about how long it would take or how difficult it would be. \n\nThey made it seem easy, like a quick victory, but it's not that simple. Building a democracy takes time, and it takes a lot of work. Look at our own country, it took years of struggle to get to where we are now.  \n\nI think we should have never gone to war in the first place. But if we did, we should have been prepared for everything. It's just sad that so many lives have been lost, and it's not clear if anything good will come out of it in the end.",
            "Okay, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  It just feels like a personal thing, y'know? Kinda like, who are we to decide what's right for someone else?  And, you know, science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just something you choose. It's like, how can you deny someone rights because of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. It's a personal thing, between two people, not some big political deal.  Like, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who are just trying to live their lives, but they can't even get married because, well, you know. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their business.  It's crazy to me that someone like Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nI mean, I've read stuff, seen it on TV, that suggests it might even be in your genes, you know?  Maybe you're just born that way, not because of anything you did growing up.  It's not like choosing to have chocolate ice cream over vanilla. \n\nIt's just... the whole thing feels unfair.  A guy and a girl can get married anytime, no big deal. But two guys or two girls, it's like front-page news!  It should be a private thing, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal. When you chuck something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops.  It's out there for everyone to see.  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  Once you put something out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out. You can't just toss that into the digital world and expect it to disappear.  The internet's a giant town square, everyone's checking it out.  Your friends on Myspace get those updates, right? It's not like the school magically got a bulletin, someone brought it to their attention.  They have to take action because, you know, what if something actually happens?  They could be blamed for not doing anything.\n\nThe tricky part is, you never know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a social experiment gone wrong, like that sociology class I heard about, or it could be something really, really bad.  \n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated.  They looked at the kid's Facebook because someone was worried about some stuff he posted.  It might have seemed like a joke to him, but given the situation, it became a serious issue.\n\nBottom line, when you put stuff online, there's no real privacy anymore.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control what people think or take seriously.  \n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on MySpace and Facebook, stalking their profiles, or snooping through their LiveJournals.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.   They shouldn't be monitoring phone calls and texts, but if it comes up, it's a whole different story.\n\nBasically, don't be posting stuff online that you wouldn't want your grandma to see.",
            "Right, so, I feel like this whole war thing has dragged on way too long. I get that at first, we had good intentions, you know, wanting to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just doing it to prove how powerful we are, like a big \"look at us!\" kinda thing.  \n\nPlus, it makes me wonder about those original motives, especially with all the baggage between Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to bring democracy to a place ruled by a dictator, that would be a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal stuff mixed in, that's not cool.  \n\nI think we made a pretty big statement in the beginning, showing everyone we weren't messing around. But after all these years – years! – I just don't see the point anymore. It feels like we're stuck in this endless cycle of fighting, just for the sake of fighting.  \n\nWe need a clear end to this, a win, or something. We can't just keep throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.  We gotta think about our own problems too, you know?  Billions are going overseas when we have poverty, education issues, healthcare…things that need fixing right here at home.  \n\nIt's like we're pouring money into this bottomless pit while our own citizens are struggling. It's just not right.  \n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We need to focus on fixing things here, supporting our people, and not wasting money on a war that's gone on for far too long.",
            "So, there's this question about privacy on Myspace, right? \nLike, what happens when someone looks at your profile and finds something that could, you know, get someone hurt?\nI mean, if you post stuff online, it's kinda out there for anyone to see. Like, on Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's a weird situation though, 'cause you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, right? \nIt'd be like picking on the \"bad kids\" just because they're online. \n\nBut then again, what if someone was looking for something specific?\nLike, if they saw something that made them think someone was in danger, wouldn't it be good they found it?\n\nIt's a tough call.  I don't have Myspace myself, but I have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing that creepy people can see my stuff.\nI saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it was to find someone's info online. He got a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on IM within a minute, then got her to meet up.\nI wouldn't do that, but some people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. They already know stuff about me, like my classes, my friends, and even pictures.\n\nIt's a bit scary, 'cause you think they know a lot about you. You try to be careful about what you post, but you also want to connect with friends.  It's a balancing act.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace, which seems kinda messed up.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing just makes me feel so conflicted. It's hard to talk about it without feeling hypocritical, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who are all \"I was against it from the start.\"  But honestly, it's just so obvious now that it was a terrible idea.  Everyone knows it, except for those stuck in the administration who can't admit they were wrong. \n\nI mean, look at the polls!  Everywhere you look –  the US, Iraq, even globally –  people are saying it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there – they all agree it's time to get out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and pulling out is just going to be another disaster.  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a cultural clash, you know? The US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that's not ready for it.  It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but invading a country like that has consequences.  It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I see no reason to stay. The administration probably has some fancy reasons why we should stick it out, but I haven't heard anything convincing. If they want to leave gradually, over a year or so, I guess I wouldn't be against it.  But honestly, we should just pull out now. \n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us out right now. These are the people we're supposedly saving, trying to help. They're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. At least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" then we're not to blame if things go south. We'll be like, \"Hey, you guys wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, listen, I totally think gender stuff is still a big deal in the U.S.  And it's not just about women, either. It's more about the field you're in, you know? Like, overall, I feel women have it tougher. There's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing. Sometimes guys get hung up on having a woman as their boss.  Society's been like that for ages! \n\nSo, often women see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board might not pick them because, historically, women aren't seen as top dogs in business.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Think about staying home with kids. It's super uncommon for dads to be the stay-at-home parent, and people often judge them for it. Society thinks, \"Dude, you gotta be the breadwinner, man!\" Even if it's working great for them and the wife has the better job, people still look down on it.\n\nAnd in fashion?  It's tough for straight guys. People might not take them seriously.  Maybe it's because guys into fashion are seen as having a different kind of lifestyle, so folks wonder if they really get \"woman\" fashion.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's gender discrimination everywhere, depending on what you do. \n\nChanging it is slow, though. Society's got its ways, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s. But change is slow.  We're seeing more women in top roles, more dads at home, and people are slowly getting used to it. It's a process.\n\nI think we just gotta keep promoting the good stuff about people who are stereotyped, not be too pushy. Just show them being awesome, you know?  If you force it, people resist.  We're starting to find a good balance.\n\nChange takes time, man.",
            "So, lemme break this down. They didn't exactly *legalize* it, more like decriminalized it, y'know?  Like, instead of being a full-blown criminal offense, it's more like,  uh, a traffic ticket.  You get a citation, not locked up in the slammer. It's a lighter slap on the wrist.  But, even with that, think about job interviews, background checks - all that jazz. Those kind of repercussions, they still linger, even if it ain't a hardcore criminal charge.  I mean, people worry about that future baggage, especially with something like marijuana. \n\nThe thing is, cops and courts cost a pretty penny.  Arrest, booking, holding cells, court appearances, a lawyer, the whole shebang. It's a money pit!  And towns struggling financially? They're less likely to change their tune, even if it means saving cash in the long run.  I get it, some places are still dead set against marijuana, even if it's just about the bottom line.\n\nNow, Denver's a different story.  They're more open-minded, you know, liberal, whatever word you wanna use.  Makes sense to me.  If they're raking in the dough from somewhere else, maybe they can use it for schools, help out seniors, feed the homeless folks.  Seems like a win-win, right?\n\nLook, I'm not saying we should just let folks blaze up everywhere, in gas stations and whatnot.  There's a line. But the money thing is real.  Plus, it's still kinda taboo, you know?  Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it'd be awkward af.\n\nNow, alcohol's got its own nasty side effects, I ain't denying it.  But marijuana, it messes with people's lives more, y'know?  It's not just about motor skills, it's about the whole vibe.\n\nBut honestly, everyone reacts differently.  Some folks can handle it, others, not so much.  It's a tricky thing.",
            "I'd say \"maybe\" to the Catholic Church.  I mean, there's a lot to like about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, right? It's good to have roots, but it's also important to be able to change with the times.\n\nThe thing is, a lot of Catholics seem to think they *have* to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly, and they don't really welcome people who aren't, well, *perfectly* Catholic.  They don't seem very open to other religions either. \n\nTake my dad, for example. He was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church because of his religion! I mean, isn't loving others one of the biggest Catholic teachings? It seems hypocritical to preach love but then not accept people who are different. \n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing but then act another way entirely.  Their practices seem so stuck in the past, but they just keep holding on. \n\nWould allowing priests to marry change things? I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know...doing bad things. It's a whole different issue, really.  \n\nIt's probably not the marriage that's the problem.  People who hurt kids would probably find a way to do it whether they were married or not. It's just a messed up thing to do.",
            "Man, this whole thing about marriage is a real head-scratcher, you know? I haven't figured out where I stand yet.  It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage *really* means. It's a minefield,  Trying to nail down a definition without stepping on anyone's toes is tough.\n\nI'm thinking, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same.  If it's a sacrament, like baptism, the government shouldn't be in the business of giving tax breaks or special treatment based on it.  It's just two people coming together, right?  They shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not.\n\nAnd with gay marriage, I mean, it just seems like it should be a civil union thing.  Two people, one union.  Simple as that.\n\nNow, if all the states can agree on something sensible,  then maybe it should become federal law. But this whole idea of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage?  That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed just because some folks are really passionate about it.  It's not like it's a matter of life and death.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I've got a ton of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I think everyone should have the right to marry whoever they love.  It's not an issue that should be decided nationally, though. Each state should have the freedom to choose its own stance.  \n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, others are more conservative.  Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live there, you're pretty much accepting of that.  It's like choosing to live somewhere – you kinda know what to expect.\n\nSo, I believe everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Legalizing gay marriage should be left up to each state to decide.  Personally, I don't think the president should have the power to impose his views on the entire country. It's not his place to dictate what happens in every state. \n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just be a back-and-forth battle.  It's best to let each state decide what's right for them – they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, so basically, I'm saying MySpace is like a public bulletin board. Anything you put on there is meant for everyone to see, not just your friends. You gotta realize that if you post something online, even if it's not under your school's name, anyone can find it, even school officials at home.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it's totally fine if they saw something on there that could prevent a school shooting.  I mean, keeping students safe is, like, the school's responsibility, right?  \n\nNow, I get it, if they're constantly snooping through MySpace just to catch kids doing dumb stuff, that's a different story. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, I think they're totally justified in looking.\n\nIt's kinda like, you wouldn't expect to get away with writing something bad about someone in a school hallway and not getting in trouble, right?  Same kinda thing with the internet.  Everything you post online can come back to bite you later, especially when you're older. \n\nThe bottom line is, if posting on MySpace could save lives or make school a safer place, I think it's worth it. Like, imagine if they saw something that stopped a Columbine situation from happening.  That's gotta be worth it, right?",
            "Ok, so about this whole war thing... see, after nine eleven, I was all for it.  You know, getting back at them, causing some serious chaos. I was riding high on that emotional wave, and honestly, I think we all kind of overlooked the big picture. We just jumped in, unprepared, with no real plan. And now? Well, now I think it backfired spectacularly. I mean, I used to be all for it, but now, I'm totally against it. \n\nIt feels like we haven't accomplished anything.  The people over there, they're stuck fighting amongst themselves.  What good are we doing by being there if they can't even get along with each other?  I'm not saying it's not a tragedy, but I just feel numb about it now.   Truthfully, because of nine eleven, I just don't care about what goes on over there with those people. They're just fighting, tearing each other apart... it's like they don't even care about their own country. \n\nWe went in there blind, clueless about what we were facing. War for them is different, way different from how we experience it. They're savage, and I don't think they're trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's fine. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nWe were so hyped up, so caught up in the revenge thing, that we didn't think things through.  We just wanted to lash out, and I think Bush felt pressured to go to war because that's what people wanted.  He probably felt like he had no choice. \n\nBut looking back, I think we should have had a better plan. We didn't know what we were doing, there was no clear strategy. It felt like we lacked unity, like we didn't even know why we were there.  \n\nIt was all emotion, anger... and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. They'll always be like that. And at this point, I don't know if we're making enough progress to justify staying. We're hurting ourselves more than anything.  We can't stay there forever."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church could really use a bit of an update, ya know?  \n\nThey've been going on about how they're losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not super accepting of, well, a lot of stuff. Like, take gay marriage, abortion, birth control - those are biggies. They've got these super strong opinions about 'em, which is cool, but some of it feels a bit stuck in the past, ya know?  \n\nI've heard that a lot of people are starting to ditch the church 'cause they don't agree with their views on these things.  They just feel like the Church is on the wrong side of things. \n\nLike, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a church that says it's completely wrong.  Same deal with gay marriage, if that's something you support, you might not wanna be in a church that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or married priests.  But I'm not sure if that would've stopped all the bad stuff that's gone down. \n\nIt's tough to say, right? Maybe they would have done things differently if they could've gotten married or had women priests, but who knows? \n\nI just think it's weird that priests are supposed to be devoted to God but can't have regular lives with families like everyone else.  They're human too!",
            "Alright, so, like, gay marriage, huh? I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like a choice you make on purpose, right? So, gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are, you know? It's messed up to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but yeah, it seems wrong to me. Like, it's not a choice, you're just born that way. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, right? It's not something you pick, so you shouldn't be punished for it, if you get what I mean.\n\n(clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it's not really a legal thing, or even really a moral issue, you know? I mean, gay people shouldn't be put on trial or anything, like they made a wrong choice.\n\nIt's not the government's business, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nIt's tough to explain, but, like, it's not about security or morals or anything. It's just people's lives, and they should be able to live how they want. They shouldn't be punished for who they are. That's just how they were born, and that's okay.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage, you know?  It just seems like there's no good reason to say no.  People worry that it'll mess up traditional families, but honestly, it's like comparing apples and oranges.  They're different, but both relationships are, like, the same thing under the surface. It's just love, right?\n\nThere's a ton of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the hospital room with you if you're sick!  It's crazy because they're not considered family.  And who else would you want there if you're really sick?\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of research showing that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work. It's all about the connection, you know?\n\nWhat really gets me is that people think this is about churches getting involved. It's not! Gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document from the government.  The church and the state should be separate, right?\n\nAnd it's like, if you're okay with civil unions, why not just go all the way with marriage? It's the same thing, just with a different name.  It's like segregation, but for love.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how it will affect kids, but honestly, it's just about being a good parent.  Gay couples can be just as loving and caring as straight couples.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes kids get bullied or treated differently because their parents are gay. It's sad, but it happens.\n\nI think the government should definitely get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It shouldn't be up to each state to decide. \n\nThe whole thing makes me mad, especially when you hear people saying it goes against their religion.  It's like, how can they decide what's right for everyone else based on their beliefs? \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the idea that being gay is a choice or a problem. That's just not true! The American Psychological Association has said that being gay is normal and healthy. People just need to open their minds and hearts to the truth.",
            "Listen, I work the pharmacy counter at a hospital, see?  Just 'cause a medicine ain't legal doesn't mean it's all bad, y'know?  I mean, should folks be able to just walk in and grab it? Nope, not a chance. But if it can help someone, I'm all for it.  I mean, a medicine's not evil just 'cause it's outlawed, right?\n\nThink about it: we use stuff like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet in the pharmacy all the time. They're super strong, controlled, but they help folks feel better. So why slam the door on weed just 'cause it's got a bad rap?  Embrace the good parts, right?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's exactly like booze.  Both can be messy if you overdo it, but...  It's a tough call. Maybe ease into it, you know? Make it legal bit by bit, not all at once.  Gotta break down that wall of fear around weed first.  Then folks might treat it with respect, not like some devilish demon.\n\nPeople freak out 'cause it's illegal, but c'mon,  it ain't heroin or coke. It ain't that bad for you.  If we ditch the scary stories, maybe folks'll use it smart, especially for when they're sick.",
            "Y'know, I feel like the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be,  not even close.  When I was a kid, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd rock the cutest dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards!  We went to a private school, so all my friends were there too, every single weekend.  But now things are different. They've got this \"teenager mass\", all thirty minutes long, and people dress way more casual.  Especially in the summer, you'd see folks in their beach gear, straight from the sand! Families would rush in late, no biggie.  Even the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, now folks are rocking jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are fine, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As far as the church itself goes, that's all I really know. I don't get into the church politics or anything like that.\n\nSpeaking of politics, I heard about all the nasty stuff going on with priests and kids.  It makes me sick. Do you think things would have been different if the church allowed female priests or let priests get married?\n\nI don't think so. Some married guys become pedophiles anyway, they've got that urge no matter what.  I think it's something inside them, not about being married or not.  And choosing to become a priest is their own decision.  There are other religions where priests can get married, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\". They're ministers or whatever, but they can have families. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nI think it's all about genetics, like, some folks are just born with those urges. You can't change that with marriage, it might hide it for a while, but it'll probably come out eventually.  I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening, but if they knew and covered it up, shame on them!",
            "(laughs) \nMan, that whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil.  I mean, at first, I wasn't totally against the idea, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we were jumping into a war based on some pretty shaky pretexts. The Bush administration kept linking Iraq to Bin Laden and those 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We all know now that was a load of crap.  \n\nI just can't stand how the Bush guys flat out lied to the American people. It's like they have zero respect for the truth, and even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. That's malfeasance, plain and simple.  An impeachable offense, if you ask me.  \n\nIt feels like they came into office with a war on their minds, wanting to make a statement. There was even talk, after that Secretary of the Treasury guy got kicked out, about how younger Bush had a personal grudge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad.  I mean, what a mess.  And let's not forget about the whole energy thing - like it's all about securing oil, y'know?  Pretty slimy. \n\nLook, it's gone on for way too long.  Pulling out now would be a disaster, though.  Iraq could easily spiral into civil war, and even more people would die. The UN is trying to put together some kind of coalition from the region - Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing - but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's gonna mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and we're already seeing problems with the government. The Parliament is a joke, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to be in control.  And then there's al-Sadr and all those other factions fighting for power. It's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)",
            "You know, this whole War in Iraq thing, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, like we just went in there because we thought Iraq was behind 9/11, you know?  I'm not one to get all worked up about war stuff, but it just doesn't sit right with me.  We're supposedly there to build democracy and grab some oil, but honestly, it's making everyone miserable.  Trying to force democracy on a place that's not ready for it is like trying to teach a toddler calculus.  It just ain't gonna happen overnight.  And if we leave, they'll probably blame us for messing everything up. It's a real catch-22.\n\nI feel bad for Bush, too. This whole thing is making him look like one of those presidents people remember for all the wrong reasons, like the Vietnam War president.  It's heavy stuff.\n\nOf course, there are those families with loved ones over there, and I don't want them to be stuck in danger. But at the same time, I just feel like we're not helping them.  We're changing their culture, forcing our way of life on them. That's just gonna make things worse.\n\nThis whole thing is a mess, and I don't think there's an easy solution. It feels like it's gonna drag on for years and years, and I just hope it doesn't make things even worse in the end.",
            "Ugh, it just feels wrong to think about the government making something legal or illegal, especially something like this. It's all about the separation of church and state, right? The Constitution is super clear about that – it's right there in black and white.  Trying to push laws on this stuff feels like going against what's already been decided.\n\nPlus, it's like picking one church's beliefs over another's. Most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in a few places like Boston.  Shouldn't it be up to the churches themselves to decide?  \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal in the US, it's all about letting people practice their religions freely. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It goes against what's already in the Constitution, and it'd be weird – it's one of the few amendments that would restrict people instead of the government.\n\nHonestly, the government shouldn't be involved at all.  This guy pushing for it just seems like he wants to enforce his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It's not fair to favor one religion over others. This is something the churches should decide, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to ban it, it doesn't hurt the economy or anything else – it might even make things better.",
            "The whole Iraq war is just a mess, you know? Right from the start, I don't think the government was straight with us about why they wanted to invade. They tried to tie it all to 9/11, making it seem like Iraq was behind it, but that just wasn't true. They used our anger and fear after 9/11 to push us into war, and it all started back in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike, and this whole thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from the mistakes we made there. We've lost so many good American soldiers, and for what? They went in, overthrew the Iraqi government, didn't have a plan for what to do next, and now look at the chaos. It's like they thought they could just drop in, install a democracy, and everything would be sunshine and rainbows.  \n\nThey're trying to do the same thing they did in Vietnam, pushing their idea of democracy onto a country that wasn't ready for it. It's a tough fight, especially when you're not fighting a regular army, but the people themselves. You can't just conquer a country and expect everyone to be happy about it. \n\nThe government didn't plan for the aftermath. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the violence, the rebuilding. We're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, trying to train the Iraqi army and police. It's a long, hard process, and I don't think the US government was honest with the American people about how long it would take or how difficult it would be. \n\nThey made it seem easy, like a quick victory, but it's not that simple. Building a democracy takes time, and it takes a lot of work. Look at our own country, it took years of struggle to get to where we are now.  \n\nI think we should have never gone to war in the first place. But if we did, we should have been prepared for everything. It's just sad that so many lives have been lost, and it's not clear if anything good will come out of it in the end.",
            "Okay, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  It just feels like a personal thing, y'know? Kinda like, who are we to decide what's right for someone else?  And, you know, science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just something you choose. It's like, how can you deny someone rights because of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. It's a personal thing, between two people, not some big political deal.  Like, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who are just trying to live their lives, but they can't even get married because, well, you know. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their business.  It's crazy to me that someone like Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nI mean, I've read stuff, seen it on TV, that suggests it might even be in your genes, you know?  Maybe you're just born that way, not because of anything you did growing up.  It's not like choosing to have chocolate ice cream over vanilla. \n\nIt's just... the whole thing feels unfair.  A guy and a girl can get married anytime, no big deal. But two guys or two girls, it's like front-page news!  It should be a private thing, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal. When you chuck something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops.  It's out there for everyone to see.  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  Once you put something out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out. You can't just toss that into the digital world and expect it to disappear.  The internet's a giant town square, everyone's checking it out.  Your friends on Myspace get those updates, right? It's not like the school magically got a bulletin, someone brought it to their attention.  They have to take action because, you know, what if something actually happens?  They could be blamed for not doing anything.\n\nThe tricky part is, you never know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a social experiment gone wrong, like that sociology class I heard about, or it could be something really, really bad.  \n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated.  They looked at the kid's Facebook because someone was worried about some stuff he posted.  It might have seemed like a joke to him, but given the situation, it became a serious issue.\n\nBottom line, when you put stuff online, there's no real privacy anymore.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control what people think or take seriously.  \n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on MySpace and Facebook, stalking their profiles, or snooping through their LiveJournals.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.   They shouldn't be monitoring phone calls and texts, but if it comes up, it's a whole different story.\n\nBasically, don't be posting stuff online that you wouldn't want your grandma to see.",
            "Right, so, I feel like this whole war thing has dragged on way too long. I get that at first, we had good intentions, you know, wanting to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just doing it to prove how powerful we are, like a big \"look at us!\" kinda thing.  \n\nPlus, it makes me wonder about those original motives, especially with all the baggage between Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to bring democracy to a place ruled by a dictator, that would be a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal stuff mixed in, that's not cool.  \n\nI think we made a pretty big statement in the beginning, showing everyone we weren't messing around. But after all these years – years! – I just don't see the point anymore. It feels like we're stuck in this endless cycle of fighting, just for the sake of fighting.  \n\nWe need a clear end to this, a win, or something. We can't just keep throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.  We gotta think about our own problems too, you know?  Billions are going overseas when we have poverty, education issues, healthcare…things that need fixing right here at home.  \n\nIt's like we're pouring money into this bottomless pit while our own citizens are struggling. It's just not right.  \n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We need to focus on fixing things here, supporting our people, and not wasting money on a war that's gone on for far too long.",
            "So, there's this question about privacy on Myspace, right? \nLike, what happens when someone looks at your profile and finds something that could, you know, get someone hurt?\nI mean, if you post stuff online, it's kinda out there for anyone to see. Like, on Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's a weird situation though, 'cause you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, right? \nIt'd be like picking on the \"bad kids\" just because they're online. \n\nBut then again, what if someone was looking for something specific?\nLike, if they saw something that made them think someone was in danger, wouldn't it be good they found it?\n\nIt's a tough call.  I don't have Myspace myself, but I have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing that creepy people can see my stuff.\nI saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it was to find someone's info online. He got a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on IM within a minute, then got her to meet up.\nI wouldn't do that, but some people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. They already know stuff about me, like my classes, my friends, and even pictures.\n\nIt's a bit scary, 'cause you think they know a lot about you. You try to be careful about what you post, but you also want to connect with friends.  It's a balancing act.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace, which seems kinda messed up.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing just makes me feel so conflicted. It's hard to talk about it without feeling hypocritical, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who are all \"I was against it from the start.\"  But honestly, it's just so obvious now that it was a terrible idea.  Everyone knows it, except for those stuck in the administration who can't admit they were wrong. \n\nI mean, look at the polls!  Everywhere you look –  the US, Iraq, even globally –  people are saying it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there – they all agree it's time to get out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and pulling out is just going to be another disaster.  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a cultural clash, you know? The US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that's not ready for it.  It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but invading a country like that has consequences.  It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I see no reason to stay. The administration probably has some fancy reasons why we should stick it out, but I haven't heard anything convincing. If they want to leave gradually, over a year or so, I guess I wouldn't be against it.  But honestly, we should just pull out now. \n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us out right now. These are the people we're supposedly saving, trying to help. They're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. At least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" then we're not to blame if things go south. We'll be like, \"Hey, you guys wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, listen, I totally think gender stuff is still a big deal in the U.S.  And it's not just about women, either. It's more about the field you're in, you know? Like, overall, I feel women have it tougher. There's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing. Sometimes guys get hung up on having a woman as their boss.  Society's been like that for ages! \n\nSo, often women see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board might not pick them because, historically, women aren't seen as top dogs in business.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Think about staying home with kids. It's super uncommon for dads to be the stay-at-home parent, and people often judge them for it. Society thinks, \"Dude, you gotta be the breadwinner, man!\" Even if it's working great for them and the wife has the better job, people still look down on it.\n\nAnd in fashion?  It's tough for straight guys. People might not take them seriously.  Maybe it's because guys into fashion are seen as having a different kind of lifestyle, so folks wonder if they really get \"woman\" fashion.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's gender discrimination everywhere, depending on what you do. \n\nChanging it is slow, though. Society's got its ways, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s. But change is slow.  We're seeing more women in top roles, more dads at home, and people are slowly getting used to it. It's a process.\n\nI think we just gotta keep promoting the good stuff about people who are stereotyped, not be too pushy. Just show them being awesome, you know?  If you force it, people resist.  We're starting to find a good balance.\n\nChange takes time, man.",
            "So, lemme break this down. They didn't exactly *legalize* it, more like decriminalized it, y'know?  Like, instead of being a full-blown criminal offense, it's more like,  uh, a traffic ticket.  You get a citation, not locked up in the slammer. It's a lighter slap on the wrist.  But, even with that, think about job interviews, background checks - all that jazz. Those kind of repercussions, they still linger, even if it ain't a hardcore criminal charge.  I mean, people worry about that future baggage, especially with something like marijuana. \n\nThe thing is, cops and courts cost a pretty penny.  Arrest, booking, holding cells, court appearances, a lawyer, the whole shebang. It's a money pit!  And towns struggling financially? They're less likely to change their tune, even if it means saving cash in the long run.  I get it, some places are still dead set against marijuana, even if it's just about the bottom line.\n\nNow, Denver's a different story.  They're more open-minded, you know, liberal, whatever word you wanna use.  Makes sense to me.  If they're raking in the dough from somewhere else, maybe they can use it for schools, help out seniors, feed the homeless folks.  Seems like a win-win, right?\n\nLook, I'm not saying we should just let folks blaze up everywhere, in gas stations and whatnot.  There's a line. But the money thing is real.  Plus, it's still kinda taboo, you know?  Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it'd be awkward af.\n\nNow, alcohol's got its own nasty side effects, I ain't denying it.  But marijuana, it messes with people's lives more, y'know?  It's not just about motor skills, it's about the whole vibe.\n\nBut honestly, everyone reacts differently.  Some folks can handle it, others, not so much.  It's a tricky thing.",
            "I'd say \"maybe\" to the Catholic Church.  I mean, there's a lot to like about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, right? It's good to have roots, but it's also important to be able to change with the times.\n\nThe thing is, a lot of Catholics seem to think they *have* to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly, and they don't really welcome people who aren't, well, *perfectly* Catholic.  They don't seem very open to other religions either. \n\nTake my dad, for example. He was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church because of his religion! I mean, isn't loving others one of the biggest Catholic teachings? It seems hypocritical to preach love but then not accept people who are different. \n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing but then act another way entirely.  Their practices seem so stuck in the past, but they just keep holding on. \n\nWould allowing priests to marry change things? I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know...doing bad things. It's a whole different issue, really.  \n\nIt's probably not the marriage that's the problem.  People who hurt kids would probably find a way to do it whether they were married or not. It's just a messed up thing to do.",
            "Man, this whole thing about marriage is a real head-scratcher, you know? I haven't figured out where I stand yet.  It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage *really* means. It's a minefield,  Trying to nail down a definition without stepping on anyone's toes is tough.\n\nI'm thinking, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same.  If it's a sacrament, like baptism, the government shouldn't be in the business of giving tax breaks or special treatment based on it.  It's just two people coming together, right?  They shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not.\n\nAnd with gay marriage, I mean, it just seems like it should be a civil union thing.  Two people, one union.  Simple as that.\n\nNow, if all the states can agree on something sensible,  then maybe it should become federal law. But this whole idea of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage?  That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed just because some folks are really passionate about it.  It's not like it's a matter of life and death.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I've got a ton of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I think everyone should have the right to marry whoever they love.  It's not an issue that should be decided nationally, though. Each state should have the freedom to choose its own stance.  \n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, others are more conservative.  Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live there, you're pretty much accepting of that.  It's like choosing to live somewhere – you kinda know what to expect.\n\nSo, I believe everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Legalizing gay marriage should be left up to each state to decide.  Personally, I don't think the president should have the power to impose his views on the entire country. It's not his place to dictate what happens in every state. \n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just be a back-and-forth battle.  It's best to let each state decide what's right for them – they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, so basically, I'm saying MySpace is like a public bulletin board. Anything you put on there is meant for everyone to see, not just your friends. You gotta realize that if you post something online, even if it's not under your school's name, anyone can find it, even school officials at home.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it's totally fine if they saw something on there that could prevent a school shooting.  I mean, keeping students safe is, like, the school's responsibility, right?  \n\nNow, I get it, if they're constantly snooping through MySpace just to catch kids doing dumb stuff, that's a different story. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, I think they're totally justified in looking.\n\nIt's kinda like, you wouldn't expect to get away with writing something bad about someone in a school hallway and not getting in trouble, right?  Same kinda thing with the internet.  Everything you post online can come back to bite you later, especially when you're older. \n\nThe bottom line is, if posting on MySpace could save lives or make school a safer place, I think it's worth it. Like, imagine if they saw something that stopped a Columbine situation from happening.  That's gotta be worth it, right?",
            "Ok, so about this whole war thing... see, after nine eleven, I was all for it.  You know, getting back at them, causing some serious chaos. I was riding high on that emotional wave, and honestly, I think we all kind of overlooked the big picture. We just jumped in, unprepared, with no real plan. And now? Well, now I think it backfired spectacularly. I mean, I used to be all for it, but now, I'm totally against it. \n\nIt feels like we haven't accomplished anything.  The people over there, they're stuck fighting amongst themselves.  What good are we doing by being there if they can't even get along with each other?  I'm not saying it's not a tragedy, but I just feel numb about it now.   Truthfully, because of nine eleven, I just don't care about what goes on over there with those people. They're just fighting, tearing each other apart... it's like they don't even care about their own country. \n\nWe went in there blind, clueless about what we were facing. War for them is different, way different from how we experience it. They're savage, and I don't think they're trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's fine. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nWe were so hyped up, so caught up in the revenge thing, that we didn't think things through.  We just wanted to lash out, and I think Bush felt pressured to go to war because that's what people wanted.  He probably felt like he had no choice. \n\nBut looking back, I think we should have had a better plan. We didn't know what we were doing, there was no clear strategy. It felt like we lacked unity, like we didn't even know why we were there.  \n\nIt was all emotion, anger... and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. They'll always be like that. And at this point, I don't know if we're making enough progress to justify staying. We're hurting ourselves more than anything.  We can't stay there forever."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church could really use a bit of an update, ya know?  \n\nThey've been going on about how they're losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not super accepting of, well, a lot of stuff. Like, take gay marriage, abortion, birth control - those are biggies. They've got these super strong opinions about 'em, which is cool, but some of it feels a bit stuck in the past, ya know?  \n\nI've heard that a lot of people are starting to ditch the church 'cause they don't agree with their views on these things.  They just feel like the Church is on the wrong side of things. \n\nLike, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a church that says it's completely wrong.  Same deal with gay marriage, if that's something you support, you might not wanna be in a church that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or married priests.  But I'm not sure if that would've stopped all the bad stuff that's gone down. \n\nIt's tough to say, right? Maybe they would have done things differently if they could've gotten married or had women priests, but who knows? \n\nI just think it's weird that priests are supposed to be devoted to God but can't have regular lives with families like everyone else.  They're human too!",
            "Alright, so, like, gay marriage, huh? I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like a choice you make on purpose, right? So, gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are, you know? It's messed up to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but yeah, it seems wrong to me. Like, it's not a choice, you're just born that way. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, right? It's not something you pick, so you shouldn't be punished for it, if you get what I mean.\n\n(clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it's not really a legal thing, or even really a moral issue, you know? I mean, gay people shouldn't be put on trial or anything, like they made a wrong choice.\n\nIt's not the government's business, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nIt's tough to explain, but, like, it's not about security or morals or anything. It's just people's lives, and they should be able to live how they want. They shouldn't be punished for who they are. That's just how they were born, and that's okay.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage, you know?  It just seems like there's no good reason to say no.  People worry that it'll mess up traditional families, but honestly, it's like comparing apples and oranges.  They're different, but both relationships are, like, the same thing under the surface. It's just love, right?\n\nThere's a ton of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the hospital room with you if you're sick!  It's crazy because they're not considered family.  And who else would you want there if you're really sick?\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of research showing that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work. It's all about the connection, you know?\n\nWhat really gets me is that people think this is about churches getting involved. It's not! Gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document from the government.  The church and the state should be separate, right?\n\nAnd it's like, if you're okay with civil unions, why not just go all the way with marriage? It's the same thing, just with a different name.  It's like segregation, but for love.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how it will affect kids, but honestly, it's just about being a good parent.  Gay couples can be just as loving and caring as straight couples.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes kids get bullied or treated differently because their parents are gay. It's sad, but it happens.\n\nI think the government should definitely get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It shouldn't be up to each state to decide. \n\nThe whole thing makes me mad, especially when you hear people saying it goes against their religion.  It's like, how can they decide what's right for everyone else based on their beliefs? \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the idea that being gay is a choice or a problem. That's just not true! The American Psychological Association has said that being gay is normal and healthy. People just need to open their minds and hearts to the truth.",
            "Listen, I work the pharmacy counter at a hospital, see?  Just 'cause a medicine ain't legal doesn't mean it's all bad, y'know?  I mean, should folks be able to just walk in and grab it? Nope, not a chance. But if it can help someone, I'm all for it.  I mean, a medicine's not evil just 'cause it's outlawed, right?\n\nThink about it: we use stuff like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet in the pharmacy all the time. They're super strong, controlled, but they help folks feel better. So why slam the door on weed just 'cause it's got a bad rap?  Embrace the good parts, right?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's exactly like booze.  Both can be messy if you overdo it, but...  It's a tough call. Maybe ease into it, you know? Make it legal bit by bit, not all at once.  Gotta break down that wall of fear around weed first.  Then folks might treat it with respect, not like some devilish demon.\n\nPeople freak out 'cause it's illegal, but c'mon,  it ain't heroin or coke. It ain't that bad for you.  If we ditch the scary stories, maybe folks'll use it smart, especially for when they're sick.",
            "Y'know, I feel like the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be,  not even close.  When I was a kid, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd rock the cutest dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards!  We went to a private school, so all my friends were there too, every single weekend.  But now things are different. They've got this \"teenager mass\", all thirty minutes long, and people dress way more casual.  Especially in the summer, you'd see folks in their beach gear, straight from the sand! Families would rush in late, no biggie.  Even the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, now folks are rocking jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are fine, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As far as the church itself goes, that's all I really know. I don't get into the church politics or anything like that.\n\nSpeaking of politics, I heard about all the nasty stuff going on with priests and kids.  It makes me sick. Do you think things would have been different if the church allowed female priests or let priests get married?\n\nI don't think so. Some married guys become pedophiles anyway, they've got that urge no matter what.  I think it's something inside them, not about being married or not.  And choosing to become a priest is their own decision.  There are other religions where priests can get married, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\". They're ministers or whatever, but they can have families. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nI think it's all about genetics, like, some folks are just born with those urges. You can't change that with marriage, it might hide it for a while, but it'll probably come out eventually.  I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening, but if they knew and covered it up, shame on them!",
            "(laughs) \nMan, that whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil.  I mean, at first, I wasn't totally against the idea, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we were jumping into a war based on some pretty shaky pretexts. The Bush administration kept linking Iraq to Bin Laden and those 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We all know now that was a load of crap.  \n\nI just can't stand how the Bush guys flat out lied to the American people. It's like they have zero respect for the truth, and even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. That's malfeasance, plain and simple.  An impeachable offense, if you ask me.  \n\nIt feels like they came into office with a war on their minds, wanting to make a statement. There was even talk, after that Secretary of the Treasury guy got kicked out, about how younger Bush had a personal grudge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad.  I mean, what a mess.  And let's not forget about the whole energy thing - like it's all about securing oil, y'know?  Pretty slimy. \n\nLook, it's gone on for way too long.  Pulling out now would be a disaster, though.  Iraq could easily spiral into civil war, and even more people would die. The UN is trying to put together some kind of coalition from the region - Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing - but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's gonna mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and we're already seeing problems with the government. The Parliament is a joke, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to be in control.  And then there's al-Sadr and all those other factions fighting for power. It's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)",
            "You know, this whole War in Iraq thing, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, like we just went in there because we thought Iraq was behind 9/11, you know?  I'm not one to get all worked up about war stuff, but it just doesn't sit right with me.  We're supposedly there to build democracy and grab some oil, but honestly, it's making everyone miserable.  Trying to force democracy on a place that's not ready for it is like trying to teach a toddler calculus.  It just ain't gonna happen overnight.  And if we leave, they'll probably blame us for messing everything up. It's a real catch-22.\n\nI feel bad for Bush, too. This whole thing is making him look like one of those presidents people remember for all the wrong reasons, like the Vietnam War president.  It's heavy stuff.\n\nOf course, there are those families with loved ones over there, and I don't want them to be stuck in danger. But at the same time, I just feel like we're not helping them.  We're changing their culture, forcing our way of life on them. That's just gonna make things worse.\n\nThis whole thing is a mess, and I don't think there's an easy solution. It feels like it's gonna drag on for years and years, and I just hope it doesn't make things even worse in the end.",
            "Ugh, it just feels wrong to think about the government making something legal or illegal, especially something like this. It's all about the separation of church and state, right? The Constitution is super clear about that – it's right there in black and white.  Trying to push laws on this stuff feels like going against what's already been decided.\n\nPlus, it's like picking one church's beliefs over another's. Most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in a few places like Boston.  Shouldn't it be up to the churches themselves to decide?  \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal in the US, it's all about letting people practice their religions freely. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It goes against what's already in the Constitution, and it'd be weird – it's one of the few amendments that would restrict people instead of the government.\n\nHonestly, the government shouldn't be involved at all.  This guy pushing for it just seems like he wants to enforce his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It's not fair to favor one religion over others. This is something the churches should decide, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to ban it, it doesn't hurt the economy or anything else – it might even make things better.",
            "The whole Iraq war is just a mess, you know? Right from the start, I don't think the government was straight with us about why they wanted to invade. They tried to tie it all to 9/11, making it seem like Iraq was behind it, but that just wasn't true. They used our anger and fear after 9/11 to push us into war, and it all started back in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike, and this whole thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from the mistakes we made there. We've lost so many good American soldiers, and for what? They went in, overthrew the Iraqi government, didn't have a plan for what to do next, and now look at the chaos. It's like they thought they could just drop in, install a democracy, and everything would be sunshine and rainbows.  \n\nThey're trying to do the same thing they did in Vietnam, pushing their idea of democracy onto a country that wasn't ready for it. It's a tough fight, especially when you're not fighting a regular army, but the people themselves. You can't just conquer a country and expect everyone to be happy about it. \n\nThe government didn't plan for the aftermath. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the violence, the rebuilding. We're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, trying to train the Iraqi army and police. It's a long, hard process, and I don't think the US government was honest with the American people about how long it would take or how difficult it would be. \n\nThey made it seem easy, like a quick victory, but it's not that simple. Building a democracy takes time, and it takes a lot of work. Look at our own country, it took years of struggle to get to where we are now.  \n\nI think we should have never gone to war in the first place. But if we did, we should have been prepared for everything. It's just sad that so many lives have been lost, and it's not clear if anything good will come out of it in the end.",
            "Okay, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  It just feels like a personal thing, y'know? Kinda like, who are we to decide what's right for someone else?  And, you know, science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just something you choose. It's like, how can you deny someone rights because of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. It's a personal thing, between two people, not some big political deal.  Like, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who are just trying to live their lives, but they can't even get married because, well, you know. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their business.  It's crazy to me that someone like Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nI mean, I've read stuff, seen it on TV, that suggests it might even be in your genes, you know?  Maybe you're just born that way, not because of anything you did growing up.  It's not like choosing to have chocolate ice cream over vanilla. \n\nIt's just... the whole thing feels unfair.  A guy and a girl can get married anytime, no big deal. But two guys or two girls, it's like front-page news!  It should be a private thing, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal. When you chuck something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops.  It's out there for everyone to see.  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  Once you put something out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out. You can't just toss that into the digital world and expect it to disappear.  The internet's a giant town square, everyone's checking it out.  Your friends on Myspace get those updates, right? It's not like the school magically got a bulletin, someone brought it to their attention.  They have to take action because, you know, what if something actually happens?  They could be blamed for not doing anything.\n\nThe tricky part is, you never know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a social experiment gone wrong, like that sociology class I heard about, or it could be something really, really bad.  \n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated.  They looked at the kid's Facebook because someone was worried about some stuff he posted.  It might have seemed like a joke to him, but given the situation, it became a serious issue.\n\nBottom line, when you put stuff online, there's no real privacy anymore.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control what people think or take seriously.  \n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on MySpace and Facebook, stalking their profiles, or snooping through their LiveJournals.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.   They shouldn't be monitoring phone calls and texts, but if it comes up, it's a whole different story.\n\nBasically, don't be posting stuff online that you wouldn't want your grandma to see.",
            "Right, so, I feel like this whole war thing has dragged on way too long. I get that at first, we had good intentions, you know, wanting to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just doing it to prove how powerful we are, like a big \"look at us!\" kinda thing.  \n\nPlus, it makes me wonder about those original motives, especially with all the baggage between Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to bring democracy to a place ruled by a dictator, that would be a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal stuff mixed in, that's not cool.  \n\nI think we made a pretty big statement in the beginning, showing everyone we weren't messing around. But after all these years – years! – I just don't see the point anymore. It feels like we're stuck in this endless cycle of fighting, just for the sake of fighting.  \n\nWe need a clear end to this, a win, or something. We can't just keep throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.  We gotta think about our own problems too, you know?  Billions are going overseas when we have poverty, education issues, healthcare…things that need fixing right here at home.  \n\nIt's like we're pouring money into this bottomless pit while our own citizens are struggling. It's just not right.  \n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We need to focus on fixing things here, supporting our people, and not wasting money on a war that's gone on for far too long.",
            "So, there's this question about privacy on Myspace, right? \nLike, what happens when someone looks at your profile and finds something that could, you know, get someone hurt?\nI mean, if you post stuff online, it's kinda out there for anyone to see. Like, on Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's a weird situation though, 'cause you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, right? \nIt'd be like picking on the \"bad kids\" just because they're online. \n\nBut then again, what if someone was looking for something specific?\nLike, if they saw something that made them think someone was in danger, wouldn't it be good they found it?\n\nIt's a tough call.  I don't have Myspace myself, but I have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing that creepy people can see my stuff.\nI saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it was to find someone's info online. He got a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on IM within a minute, then got her to meet up.\nI wouldn't do that, but some people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. They already know stuff about me, like my classes, my friends, and even pictures.\n\nIt's a bit scary, 'cause you think they know a lot about you. You try to be careful about what you post, but you also want to connect with friends.  It's a balancing act.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace, which seems kinda messed up.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing just makes me feel so conflicted. It's hard to talk about it without feeling hypocritical, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who are all \"I was against it from the start.\"  But honestly, it's just so obvious now that it was a terrible idea.  Everyone knows it, except for those stuck in the administration who can't admit they were wrong. \n\nI mean, look at the polls!  Everywhere you look –  the US, Iraq, even globally –  people are saying it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there – they all agree it's time to get out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and pulling out is just going to be another disaster.  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a cultural clash, you know? The US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that's not ready for it.  It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but invading a country like that has consequences.  It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I see no reason to stay. The administration probably has some fancy reasons why we should stick it out, but I haven't heard anything convincing. If they want to leave gradually, over a year or so, I guess I wouldn't be against it.  But honestly, we should just pull out now. \n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us out right now. These are the people we're supposedly saving, trying to help. They're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. At least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" then we're not to blame if things go south. We'll be like, \"Hey, you guys wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, listen, I totally think gender stuff is still a big deal in the U.S.  And it's not just about women, either. It's more about the field you're in, you know? Like, overall, I feel women have it tougher. There's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing. Sometimes guys get hung up on having a woman as their boss.  Society's been like that for ages! \n\nSo, often women see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board might not pick them because, historically, women aren't seen as top dogs in business.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Think about staying home with kids. It's super uncommon for dads to be the stay-at-home parent, and people often judge them for it. Society thinks, \"Dude, you gotta be the breadwinner, man!\" Even if it's working great for them and the wife has the better job, people still look down on it.\n\nAnd in fashion?  It's tough for straight guys. People might not take them seriously.  Maybe it's because guys into fashion are seen as having a different kind of lifestyle, so folks wonder if they really get \"woman\" fashion.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's gender discrimination everywhere, depending on what you do. \n\nChanging it is slow, though. Society's got its ways, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s. But change is slow.  We're seeing more women in top roles, more dads at home, and people are slowly getting used to it. It's a process.\n\nI think we just gotta keep promoting the good stuff about people who are stereotyped, not be too pushy. Just show them being awesome, you know?  If you force it, people resist.  We're starting to find a good balance.\n\nChange takes time, man.",
            "So, lemme break this down. They didn't exactly *legalize* it, more like decriminalized it, y'know?  Like, instead of being a full-blown criminal offense, it's more like,  uh, a traffic ticket.  You get a citation, not locked up in the slammer. It's a lighter slap on the wrist.  But, even with that, think about job interviews, background checks - all that jazz. Those kind of repercussions, they still linger, even if it ain't a hardcore criminal charge.  I mean, people worry about that future baggage, especially with something like marijuana. \n\nThe thing is, cops and courts cost a pretty penny.  Arrest, booking, holding cells, court appearances, a lawyer, the whole shebang. It's a money pit!  And towns struggling financially? They're less likely to change their tune, even if it means saving cash in the long run.  I get it, some places are still dead set against marijuana, even if it's just about the bottom line.\n\nNow, Denver's a different story.  They're more open-minded, you know, liberal, whatever word you wanna use.  Makes sense to me.  If they're raking in the dough from somewhere else, maybe they can use it for schools, help out seniors, feed the homeless folks.  Seems like a win-win, right?\n\nLook, I'm not saying we should just let folks blaze up everywhere, in gas stations and whatnot.  There's a line. But the money thing is real.  Plus, it's still kinda taboo, you know?  Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it'd be awkward af.\n\nNow, alcohol's got its own nasty side effects, I ain't denying it.  But marijuana, it messes with people's lives more, y'know?  It's not just about motor skills, it's about the whole vibe.\n\nBut honestly, everyone reacts differently.  Some folks can handle it, others, not so much.  It's a tricky thing.",
            "I'd say \"maybe\" to the Catholic Church.  I mean, there's a lot to like about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, right? It's good to have roots, but it's also important to be able to change with the times.\n\nThe thing is, a lot of Catholics seem to think they *have* to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly, and they don't really welcome people who aren't, well, *perfectly* Catholic.  They don't seem very open to other religions either. \n\nTake my dad, for example. He was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church because of his religion! I mean, isn't loving others one of the biggest Catholic teachings? It seems hypocritical to preach love but then not accept people who are different. \n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing but then act another way entirely.  Their practices seem so stuck in the past, but they just keep holding on. \n\nWould allowing priests to marry change things? I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know...doing bad things. It's a whole different issue, really.  \n\nIt's probably not the marriage that's the problem.  People who hurt kids would probably find a way to do it whether they were married or not. It's just a messed up thing to do.",
            "Man, this whole thing about marriage is a real head-scratcher, you know? I haven't figured out where I stand yet.  It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage *really* means. It's a minefield,  Trying to nail down a definition without stepping on anyone's toes is tough.\n\nI'm thinking, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same.  If it's a sacrament, like baptism, the government shouldn't be in the business of giving tax breaks or special treatment based on it.  It's just two people coming together, right?  They shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not.\n\nAnd with gay marriage, I mean, it just seems like it should be a civil union thing.  Two people, one union.  Simple as that.\n\nNow, if all the states can agree on something sensible,  then maybe it should become federal law. But this whole idea of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage?  That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed just because some folks are really passionate about it.  It's not like it's a matter of life and death.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I've got a ton of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I think everyone should have the right to marry whoever they love.  It's not an issue that should be decided nationally, though. Each state should have the freedom to choose its own stance.  \n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, others are more conservative.  Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live there, you're pretty much accepting of that.  It's like choosing to live somewhere – you kinda know what to expect.\n\nSo, I believe everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Legalizing gay marriage should be left up to each state to decide.  Personally, I don't think the president should have the power to impose his views on the entire country. It's not his place to dictate what happens in every state. \n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just be a back-and-forth battle.  It's best to let each state decide what's right for them – they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, so basically, I'm saying MySpace is like a public bulletin board. Anything you put on there is meant for everyone to see, not just your friends. You gotta realize that if you post something online, even if it's not under your school's name, anyone can find it, even school officials at home.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it's totally fine if they saw something on there that could prevent a school shooting.  I mean, keeping students safe is, like, the school's responsibility, right?  \n\nNow, I get it, if they're constantly snooping through MySpace just to catch kids doing dumb stuff, that's a different story. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, I think they're totally justified in looking.\n\nIt's kinda like, you wouldn't expect to get away with writing something bad about someone in a school hallway and not getting in trouble, right?  Same kinda thing with the internet.  Everything you post online can come back to bite you later, especially when you're older. \n\nThe bottom line is, if posting on MySpace could save lives or make school a safer place, I think it's worth it. Like, imagine if they saw something that stopped a Columbine situation from happening.  That's gotta be worth it, right?",
            "Ok, so about this whole war thing... see, after nine eleven, I was all for it.  You know, getting back at them, causing some serious chaos. I was riding high on that emotional wave, and honestly, I think we all kind of overlooked the big picture. We just jumped in, unprepared, with no real plan. And now? Well, now I think it backfired spectacularly. I mean, I used to be all for it, but now, I'm totally against it. \n\nIt feels like we haven't accomplished anything.  The people over there, they're stuck fighting amongst themselves.  What good are we doing by being there if they can't even get along with each other?  I'm not saying it's not a tragedy, but I just feel numb about it now.   Truthfully, because of nine eleven, I just don't care about what goes on over there with those people. They're just fighting, tearing each other apart... it's like they don't even care about their own country. \n\nWe went in there blind, clueless about what we were facing. War for them is different, way different from how we experience it. They're savage, and I don't think they're trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's fine. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nWe were so hyped up, so caught up in the revenge thing, that we didn't think things through.  We just wanted to lash out, and I think Bush felt pressured to go to war because that's what people wanted.  He probably felt like he had no choice. \n\nBut looking back, I think we should have had a better plan. We didn't know what we were doing, there was no clear strategy. It felt like we lacked unity, like we didn't even know why we were there.  \n\nIt was all emotion, anger... and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. They'll always be like that. And at this point, I don't know if we're making enough progress to justify staying. We're hurting ourselves more than anything.  We can't stay there forever."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a facelift, you know?  Like, they've been droning on about losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not exactly the most open-minded bunch. They've got these super rigid views on stuff like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that everyone's entitled to their beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the dark ages! If they loosened up a tad, maybe they wouldn't be sweating so much about people ditching them.  Word on the street is a bunch of folks are ditching the Church 'cause they disagree with their stance on these hot-button issues. People are starting to feel like the Church is out of touch, and they're not keen on being told what to do. It's like, hey, if you're for abortion, you might not wanna hang out in a place that's all \"it's a sin!\"  Same goes for gay folks wanting to tie the knot.  If you're into those things, you're probably not gonna feel comfortable in a place that condemns them.  Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or let priests get hitched.  But who knows if that would've stopped the whole mess we've seen lately. It's hard to say if their current problems stem from those rules.  I mean, they might have still messed up, even if they had those things. It's a tough call.  It just seems unfair that priests have to be completely dedicated to God and can't have a normal life with a family. Everyone else gets to juggle work and personal life, why not them?",
            "Right, so, um, gay marriage, you know? I ain't against it. \n\nI figure, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like someone just decides to be gay, ya know? So, like, people shouldn't get in trouble for who they are or what they like.\n\nI mean, it seems kinda unfair, right? Like, a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two gals can't? That just seems wrong to me.  \n\nI ain't thought about it a ton, but, yeah, it's messed up to say that. It's not like you choose to be gay, like I was born straight, and someone else is born gay. It's just, well, who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong.  I don't think the government should be involved, ya know? It's not like a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really. Like, we shouldn't be putting gay folks on some kinda stage like they made a bad choice or something. That's just wrong.\n\nI don't think the government should have a say in this stuff. It's about people's lives, and, well, who they love.\n\nIt's just...weird, ya know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI mean, the government shouldn't be involved because it's not about protecting the country or anything like that. It's just about people being who they are. \n\nThey shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal, ya know?  It seems pretty clear-cut to me. Like, why not? People say gay couples are bad for families, but that's not really fair. It's just different, like two sides of the same coin - different, but still the same thing.\n\nIt's more than just that, though.  Think of all the legal stuff.  Like, if your partner is sick, they can't even be in the hospital room with you because they're not considered family. It's ridiculous if you're planning to spend your life with someone. \n\nAnd honestly, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not who you're with.  \n\nLook, they're not asking to get married in a church, they just want the legal recognition from the government.  It's like government business, not religious business.  So why do some churches, like Catholics, get so worked up about it? It's their belief, but it shouldn't dictate what the law is.\n\nIt's like segregation, you know? Separate but unequal. They're the same kind of relationship, with the same challenges and joys.  People worry about adoption and kids, but studies show that kids raised by gay parents are just fine. It's all about love and care, not who's giving it.\n\nI think the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and fairness. It's not right that one group's beliefs are forced on everyone else.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or broken, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said it's not a choice or a defect. People need to listen to experts, not just what their friends or church say. It's about time we treat everyone equally.",
            "Alright, so listen, I sling meds at a hospital pharmacy, and let me tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good in it. Like, I wouldn't wanna see it out on the streets for anyone to grab, nah, no way. But for doctors to use it to help patients?  Absolutely, I'm all for it.  'Cause, come on, just 'cause something's outlawed doesn't mean it's useless.\n\nThink about it, we pharmacies use all kinds of heavy-duty stuff, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet,  you know, the good stuff. They're controlled, sure, but they're lifesavers for a lot of folks. So, if we're gonna throw the book at marijuana just 'cause it's got a bad rap, that ain't right. We gotta look at the good it can do.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's like alcohol, 'cause yeah, too much of anything's bad. But, you know, it's a whole different beast. Maybe we should ease into it, make it legal, step by step. That way, people can learn to use it right, without going overboard.\n\nThe thing is, people see marijuana and they think, \"Drugs, bad!\" But it ain't no heroin or cocaine, you know? It ain't that scary. If we stop paintin' it as the devil's lettuce, maybe folks will chill out, use it responsibly, and maybe even find some relief from their aches and pains.",
            "Alright, so, I reckon the church has kinda stepped into the twenty-first century, ya know? It ain't as strict as it used to be.  See, when I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang.  Went to a fancy school, saw my buddies there every week, the whole shebang.  But now, things are different. They've got this teen thing going on, thirty minutes tops, people rocking up in their beach gear straight from the sand, families rushing in late. Even the morning masses, where I used to dress up like a princess, now everyone's in jeans and khakis.  It's way more casual, ya know?\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for the politics and whatnot, that's all a bit above my head.\n\nNow, about those priest shenanigans... I don't think  allowing women priests or letting them get hitched would've stopped all that. I mean, there are married guys out there who still get up to no good, right? It's not about being married or not.  It's about the person.\n\nPlus, becoming a priest is a choice, right? There are churches where fellas can get hitched and still preach, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\".  If someone really wants both, maybe they should check out a different faith.\n\nAs for the whole pedophilia thing, I think it's kinda in their genes, ya know? It's not like they learn it, it's just who they are. Like, look at it this way: you can't just change someone's genes by letting them get married. It might come out anyway.  \n\nIf the church knew about it and covered it up, well, that's messed up. Shame on them. But I don't think they always knew either.",
            "(laughs) \nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, at first, I was kinda okay with the whole Iraq thing, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we jumped into it all too quick. There were these justifications thrown around, connecting Iraq to Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam had WMDs.  Turns out, all that was a load of crap. It really grinds my gears, this whole Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nThe Bush administration flat out lied to the American people, and they still haven't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, remember that big UN speech he gave? He's now saying he wasn't even convinced by the evidence at the time! That's messed up, man. That's straight-up abuse of power.  They've got zero respect for the Constitution, they've been trying to sideline it ever since 9/11, at least. I think they came in wanting to go to war from day one. \n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary –  I can’t remember his name, but he wrote a book after being pushed out, basically saying the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam for his dad's time in office. Plus, I'm sure they had their eyes on Iraq's energy resources too.  Sneaky, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would be a disaster, though. The country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The UN and the US are trying to get a coalition of neighboring countries – Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing – to come in and try to stabilize things. But that doesn't feel right either. It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, and the interim government is already falling apart.\n\nThe news reports make it clear that the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister seems to have no real control.  Even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has 20 seats in Parliament! We're stuck with all these radical factions fighting for power, and it's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)\nThe real mess?  I can't even start explaining that. It's too much.",
            "I dunno, man.  This whole Iraq thing is a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, y'know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, officially.  Just this \"get back at 'em\" thing after 9/11, like they were the only ones who could've done it.  I'm not really into all the war talk, haven't been keeping up with the details. \n\nBut from what I gather, we're stuck there trying to build democracy, just so it can be another U.S. thing, plus, you know, the oil. But it's pissing everyone off, and it just feels wrong.\n\nIt's a catch-22, too. If we leave, they'll be pissed because we messed everything up and they're back to square one. And if we stay, it'll take forever to build this democracy thing, which is a whole other mess.\n\nHonestly, I'm lost. This is one topic I know nothing about.  War in Iraq?  My brain hurts just thinking about it.  \n\nMaybe it's better to just keep it going, right? Like, show them we're tough,  we're American, we got guns.  But it's messed up, it shouldn't even be called a war. Congress never even declared it, so what's the point?\n\nI feel bad for Bush, though. It's turning him into another  Nixon, another president who started a pointless war.  Like Vietnam, remember?  Ending up labeled as the \"meaningless war\" president.\n\nI don't know what to say. It's a tough one.  So many families have loved ones over there, you want them to come back safe, right? But then you think about the Iraqi people, their lives are screwed up, schools are gone, different groups fighting each other.\n\nWe're trying to force our way of life on them, like turning them into another USA.  But will that even work? It just seems like it'll make things worse, make them even angrier at us.\n\nMaybe this is just a war that'll drag on forever, a never-ending mess.",
            "My gut says it ain't right for the government to make this stuff legal.  It's right there in the Constitution, separation of church and state.  It's clear as day.  Trying to boss around what folks believe, that's against what's already written in stone.\n\nIt feels like picking sides, you know? Saying one church's beliefs are the right ones. Most Catholics and Christians I know are against this, except for maybe some folks in Boston. But who are we to tell churches what they can and can't say?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's how we keep things fair in this country. It's about letting everyone practice their faith without the government stepping in.\n\nTrying to change that with an amendment? That's crazy talk. It'd be like contradicting the whole Constitution. Plus, it'd be the only amendment that's used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nThe government shouldn't be involved.  This is a personal belief thing, like him pushing this amendment just 'cause he's Catholic. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all the others.\n\nLet the churches decide what's right for them.  That's what the Constitution is all about. There's no good reason to change that.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. From the get-go, I don't think the government was straight with the American people about why we went to war. They tried to link it to the September 11th attacks, making it seem like they were directly connected, when really, they weren't that closely tied. They used the emotions of the people who were hurting and angry after 9/11 to push the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes. This whole thing feels like a repeat of the Vietnam War, where the government made the same mistakes. It's heartbreaking to see so many American soldiers die, and the whole situation is a mess. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, and weren't ready for what came after. They didn't anticipate the power vacuum, the chaos, and the instability. \n\nIt's like what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and install democracy. They thought it would be a quick, clean victory, but it was a long, hard struggle. And just like in Vietnam, no matter how many people support you, there are always going to be insurgents who want to fight. It's hard to fight a war against a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up big time. First of all, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if they had to, they should have been prepared for everything that could go wrong. They weren't ready for the aftermath, and now we're still there in 2006, with American troops dying and trying to train Iraqi forces to take over. \n\nIt's a long process, and the US government made it seem like it would be easy. They made it seem like a quick, successful mission, but it's not that simple. Building a new government and a functioning democracy takes time, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history – it took a lot of struggle and bloodshed to get to where we are today.\n\nThe whole situation is complicated, and it's hard to know what the right decision is. On one hand, we can't just abandon Iraq after all we've done there.  On the other hand, how many more American lives are we willing to risk? How much is too much? And what about the oil? Isn't that a big factor in this whole mess?\n\nIt feels like we're just going through the motions, and there's no real end in sight. I just hope it all ends soon and that there can be some peace in Iraq. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so let me tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. It's a personal thing, ya know? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just some social thing.  It's kinda messed up to take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control. It's like, inhumane, ya know?  I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nI mean, politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's not their business. It's between two people, their families, their lives. Hell, there are a couple of gay couples right here in my neighborhood. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their day. They're not hurting anyone. So why can't they get married?\n\nThis whole \"Bush playing God\" thing and trying to twist the definition of marriage? It's ridiculous.\n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff, reports, articles, whatever - they're saying it's actually a chemical thing in your brain, like you're born that way. It's not about growing up with a bunch of sisters or not having a dad, it's different.\n\nIt's just unfair.  If a straight couple wants to get married, they can go do it in Vegas without anyone knowing. But for two gay people, it's like a national news story. It's like it should be a private thing, not something the whole world needs to know about.",
            "Okay, so, listen up.  When you drop something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. It's public, plain and simple. You can't just erase it or pretend it never happened. As an assistant, I've seen firsthand how stuff online can really mess things up.\n\nImagine posting about wanting to blow stuff up or talking about shootings. People are gonna freak out, man. Someone's bound to tell the school, and they can't just ignore it. If something bad happens, they'll be asking, \"Why didn't we do something?\"\n\nIt's a tough situation because sometimes people just mess around, right? Maybe it was a bad joke, or a sociology experiment gone wrong. But sometimes, it can be really serious. \n\nA while back, we had something similar happen at my school. Someone overheard a student talking about something scary, and they reported it. The school looked into it and found some concerning stuff on the student's Facebook. \n\nSee, when you put stuff online, you're basically waving a flag that says, \"Hey, look at me!\" You can't control how people react to it. They might take it seriously, or they might laugh it off. But the bottom line is, once it's out there, it's out there.\n\nSo, think before you post. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. And if you're talking about something serious, maybe just keep it to yourself. It's not worth the risk.",
            "This whole war thing stretches on forever, ya know? Once upon a time, I thought it had a decent purpose – bringing democracy to a place that needed it. But somewhere along the line, it feels like we lost sight of that. Now it's just about flexing our muscles, proving we're the big dogs.  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole thing started kinda shady. Remember Bush sr. and his beef with Saddam?  Maybe that's where the whole thing got twisted. If we were really trying to help, to bring freedom to a country under a cruel leader, that'd be a noble cause. But if there was personal baggage in there, that's just wrong.\n\nLook, I think we made our point those first few months, sending a message that we weren't messing around. But it's been years. Way too long. We keep plugging away at it, like we have to win this thing, but I don't even know what we're winning anymore.  \n\nIt's like we're stuck in this endless cycle of war just for the sake of war. We've got our own problems here at home – poverty, schools, healthcare – things that need our attention. Billions and billions are getting poured into this fight, when that money could be helping people right here. \n\nIt's got to end. At some point, these folks gotta figure out their own destiny. We can't be their babysitters forever. It's draining our own resources, our own soul. We need to stop throwing good money after bad and start focusing on what really matters.",
            "So, like, there's this question about privacy, right?  Someone found info online and, uh, it stopped something bad from happening.  Is that, like, an invasion of privacy?  \n\nI mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda open to everyone, y'know?  You gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends, they're seeing it.  You're giving them permission.  When you put stuff online, you gotta know a lot of people will see it.  So, if someone saw something and stopped something bad, maybe that's a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though.  You can't have someone watching everyone's profile all the time.  That'd be like picking on \"bad kids\" or something.  It wouldn't be fair.  But maybe if they had a reason to look at a specific profile, like if they had a lead on something?  I dunno.\n\nHmm, I don't have Myspace myself, but I use Facebook.  It creeps me out knowing there are weirdos out there who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV about a guy who showed how easy it was to get info from profiles.  He found a girl's screen name and was IMing her within a minute, got her to meet up!  I wouldn't do that, obviously.  But people in my classes message me on IM, even though I don't recognize their names.  It's scary because they know stuff about me - my interests, what I look like, where I am.  Photos, everything.  I try to limit what I put online, but it's hard.  I use it to talk to friends, but it's a risk, you know?  You never know who's looking.\n\nMy roommate said her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed kinda weird to me.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, talking about this war just feels messed up. I hate jumping on the bandwagon, you know?  \"Oh, I was against it from the start!\"  It's not really about that anymore.  I mean, everyone basically agrees it was a bad idea except for the people in power. They can't admit they were wrong, right?  \n\nLook at the polls! American polls, Iraqi polls, global polls – everyone thinks it was a disaster. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there think we should get out. It was a mess before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another mess.  It's just… everything in the Middle East is a minefield these days.\n\nIt all boils down to cultural clashes, I guess. The US and the Middle East are just too different. Our government thinks they can force democracy on them, but it's not their way. Saddam was a bad guy, sure, but invading a country blindly is never the answer.  It's like quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say anymore.  There's no easy solution. It all feels hopeless.  \n\nThe administration might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard a good one yet. Leaving gradually over a year or so, maybe that's okay. But just staying...   \n\nEighty percent of the Iraqi people want us gone within a year. At least a quarter of them want us out right now.  It's their country, shouldn't their voices matter?  \n\nMaybe we ask them, you know?  \"Should we leave?\" If they say yes, then it's on them, not us, if things go south. \n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least it'd be a step in the right direction.",
            "Okay, so yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women, you know?  It kind of depends on what field you're in. \n\nLike, overall, I feel women still have a tougher time because of this \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is supposed to be a thing,  a lot of guys struggle with the idea of having a woman boss them around. It's because of how society's been for so long, you know? So, sometimes women will see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just because, historically, women haven't been in those top positions. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other fields.  Take stay-at-home dads, for example. It's really uncommon for a guy to be the one staying home, and people often judge them for it.  Society thinks, \"Oh, you're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  But what if the wife has the better job, and he really wants to raise the kids? It can be tough because society doesn't really get it.\n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Guys who are straight and into fashion sometimes don't get taken seriously.  Maybe it's because guys in fashion are often seen as having a different lifestyle, and people assume they just don't \"get\" women's fashion. They question their knowledge and style.\n\nSo, yeah, I think gender discrimination is definitely still around in the U.S., and it depends on the field you're in.\n\nChanging it is hard, though. Society has a set way of thinking, and even though we've come a long way since the 1800s, change is slow. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in the business world, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more common.\n\nIt's all about slowly changing people's minds. You can't force it, or they'll resist. We're finding a good balance, though, where people are slowly starting to accept things more.",
            "Okay, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, you know? They decriminalized it. Like, it's not a crime anymore, it's more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not arrested. And that's a big deal, because those drug charges can mess you up big time, especially for job interviews and stuff.  Even with decriminalization, those worries about the future consequences, they don't just disappear.\n\nBut think about it, arresting people, booking them, holding them, the court appearances, the lawyers... it all costs a ton of money! And a lot of places, especially those struggling financially, just can't afford it. Even if it means letting go of a lot of that old, \"marijuana is evil\" thinking. \n\nDenver, though, they're a different story. More open-minded, you know?  They're probably using all that saved money now on good stuff, like schools, helping the elderly, feeding the homeless.  It's all about priorities, right?\n\nNow, I'm not saying marijuana should be everywhere, like cigarettes in gas stations. That would be weird! Plus,  it's still kinda frowned upon in a lot of places. Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol, though, that's a whole other story. It messes with your motor skills worse than weed, but marijuana can really mess with your life, your choices, your whole vibe. \n\nEveryone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle anything, others, not so much. It's a tricky thing to talk about because there's no one-size-fits-all answer.",
            "I'd say \"yeah\" to Catholicism, kinda. I mean, there are some solid things about it - like they've stuck to their traditions for ages, which can be good.  But, you gotta be able to bend a little, right? \n\nA lot of Catholics seem stuck on going to church every week and doing things *exactly* the way they always have. It feels kinda judgmental, like they look down on anyone who doesn't follow the rules perfectly or who's not a die-hard Catholic. They don't really seem to welcome people from other religions either.\n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them.  It felt pretty hypocritical to me,  cause Catholics are always saying love everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like they preach one thing, but then live another way. A lot of their rules feel totally outdated, but they cling to them anyway.\n\nI think letting priests get married could be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop the bad stuff from happening.  It's a different kind of issue.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are probably gonna do it no matter what, married or not. It's not about the marriage, it's about the sick person.",
            "Okay, so, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher for me. I haven't totally figured out where I stand yet. It's like walking a tightrope between separating church and state, and figuring out what marriage *really* is. It's tough to talk about without stepping on someone's toes, ya know? \n\nI'm not sure if marriage should be something the government defines, especially since it's considered a sacrament by some.  Think about it, if you were baptized, the government wouldn't care, right?  They wouldn't offer tax breaks or treat you differently.  So, maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in the \"type\" of marriage, just the fact that two people are united.  \n\nAs for gay marriage, well, if all the states can agree on a fair solution, maybe it should become federal law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it?  That seems crazy.  I mean, the constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people feel strongly about something.  It's a big deal for some, sure, but not big enough to rewrite the fundamental laws of the land.  It just feels wrong to me.",
            "My upbringing was in a Christian household, so the whole homosexuality thing is kinda a mixed bag for me.  I've got a bunch of gay friends, and I respect them, you know? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I totally think they should be able to do their thing. It shouldn't be a big national deal.  \n\nI think it should be left up to each state to decide, not the president. Like, wouldn't it be better if each state could choose what works best for them?  You've got your red states and your blue states, right? Blue states are more likely to be all for gay marriage, and if you live in a blue state, well, that's just how things are there. Kinda like, you chose to live there, so you gotta roll with it. \n\nI believe everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So yeah, I think gay marriage should be legal, but let each state decide. \n\nHonestly, it feels wrong for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what to think about gay marriage. It's not his call! Each state should be free to make its own rules. He doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to decide for them? \n\nAnd think about it, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democratic president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, what's it gonna be, back and forth forever? Just let the states figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, no, I don't at all. Let me see... The way I see it, Myspace is like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see, whether it's school officials or not.\n\nSo, when those officials saw it, they had every right to.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still access it from home.  But think about it, if it helps prevent a school shooting, you know, if it saves students' lives, that's the school's responsibility.  I think that's totally okay.\n\nNow, I get it, if they're just snooping around on Myspace looking for students to get in trouble for drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to make the school safer, I don't think it's an invasion at all.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you're writing things down.  \n\nAnyway, Myspace is public. Students posting stuff expecting not to get in trouble?  That's ridiculous!  I even worry about posting stuff on email. If I have something negative to say about someone, I never do it. I'm afraid someone will see it somehow.\n\nEverything comes back around these days, you know?  Like, if you do something bad in college, some big shot might find an old email and it bites you in the butt. Once it's on the internet, it's always there.  \n\nI don't think it was an invasion of privacy because, like I said, it's public. I don't think they should be constantly searching for trouble, but if they have a reason to look, to make the school safer, like preventing something horrible like Columbine, then I'm okay with it. Parents trust the school to keep their kids safe, and that's what they were trying to do.",
            "Alright, so, this whole war thing... at first, I was all for it, you know? Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I felt like we had to go over there and, like, dish out some payback. I get it, it was an emotional thing, but looking back, I think we rushed into it without thinking things through. We kinda went in blind, unprepared, without a real plan. And, honestly, it backfired big time. I mean, I was all for it at the start, but now? Totally against it. I just don't think it accomplished anything.\n\nIt's like, those people over there, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting us. Us being there just doesn't make a difference if they can't even get along with each other, you know? It's like pouring water on a fire that's already burning itself out.  \n\nAnd to be honest, because of Nine Eleven, I just... I don't care about what happens over there anymore. Those people, I just don't care. They fight amongst themselves, they can't even solve their own problems, it's just sad. \n\nWe went in there totally unprepared, didn't know what we were facing, and honestly, war is different for them than it is for us. They're just... savage. I don't think they're trying to improve their country, they just want us out of there. And maybe that's okay, maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, fueled by anger and revenge. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences, about how they would react to us trying to change their whole way of life. Bush declaring war on Iraq, well, I see where he was coming from. We couldn't just let them get away with it, right? But maybe we could've planned better, had a clearer idea of what we wanted to achieve.\n\nThere was no unity, no clear direction. We just went in there with anger and aggression, and that's what we created there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be like that, and we're just hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying. It's like a bandage on a gaping wound.  We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, it's just gonna collapse again. It's time to cut our losses and move on."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a facelift, you know?  Like, they've been droning on about losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not exactly the most open-minded bunch. They've got these super rigid views on stuff like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that everyone's entitled to their beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the dark ages! If they loosened up a tad, maybe they wouldn't be sweating so much about people ditching them.  Word on the street is a bunch of folks are ditching the Church 'cause they disagree with their stance on these hot-button issues. People are starting to feel like the Church is out of touch, and they're not keen on being told what to do. It's like, hey, if you're for abortion, you might not wanna hang out in a place that's all \"it's a sin!\"  Same goes for gay folks wanting to tie the knot.  If you're into those things, you're probably not gonna feel comfortable in a place that condemns them.  Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or let priests get hitched.  But who knows if that would've stopped the whole mess we've seen lately. It's hard to say if their current problems stem from those rules.  I mean, they might have still messed up, even if they had those things. It's a tough call.  It just seems unfair that priests have to be completely dedicated to God and can't have a normal life with a family. Everyone else gets to juggle work and personal life, why not them?",
            "Right, so, um, gay marriage, you know? I ain't against it. \n\nI figure, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like someone just decides to be gay, ya know? So, like, people shouldn't get in trouble for who they are or what they like.\n\nI mean, it seems kinda unfair, right? Like, a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two gals can't? That just seems wrong to me.  \n\nI ain't thought about it a ton, but, yeah, it's messed up to say that. It's not like you choose to be gay, like I was born straight, and someone else is born gay. It's just, well, who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong.  I don't think the government should be involved, ya know? It's not like a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really. Like, we shouldn't be putting gay folks on some kinda stage like they made a bad choice or something. That's just wrong.\n\nI don't think the government should have a say in this stuff. It's about people's lives, and, well, who they love.\n\nIt's just...weird, ya know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI mean, the government shouldn't be involved because it's not about protecting the country or anything like that. It's just about people being who they are. \n\nThey shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal, ya know?  It seems pretty clear-cut to me. Like, why not? People say gay couples are bad for families, but that's not really fair. It's just different, like two sides of the same coin - different, but still the same thing.\n\nIt's more than just that, though.  Think of all the legal stuff.  Like, if your partner is sick, they can't even be in the hospital room with you because they're not considered family. It's ridiculous if you're planning to spend your life with someone. \n\nAnd honestly, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not who you're with.  \n\nLook, they're not asking to get married in a church, they just want the legal recognition from the government.  It's like government business, not religious business.  So why do some churches, like Catholics, get so worked up about it? It's their belief, but it shouldn't dictate what the law is.\n\nIt's like segregation, you know? Separate but unequal. They're the same kind of relationship, with the same challenges and joys.  People worry about adoption and kids, but studies show that kids raised by gay parents are just fine. It's all about love and care, not who's giving it.\n\nI think the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and fairness. It's not right that one group's beliefs are forced on everyone else.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or broken, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said it's not a choice or a defect. People need to listen to experts, not just what their friends or church say. It's about time we treat everyone equally.",
            "Alright, so listen, I sling meds at a hospital pharmacy, and let me tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good in it. Like, I wouldn't wanna see it out on the streets for anyone to grab, nah, no way. But for doctors to use it to help patients?  Absolutely, I'm all for it.  'Cause, come on, just 'cause something's outlawed doesn't mean it's useless.\n\nThink about it, we pharmacies use all kinds of heavy-duty stuff, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet,  you know, the good stuff. They're controlled, sure, but they're lifesavers for a lot of folks. So, if we're gonna throw the book at marijuana just 'cause it's got a bad rap, that ain't right. We gotta look at the good it can do.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's like alcohol, 'cause yeah, too much of anything's bad. But, you know, it's a whole different beast. Maybe we should ease into it, make it legal, step by step. That way, people can learn to use it right, without going overboard.\n\nThe thing is, people see marijuana and they think, \"Drugs, bad!\" But it ain't no heroin or cocaine, you know? It ain't that scary. If we stop paintin' it as the devil's lettuce, maybe folks will chill out, use it responsibly, and maybe even find some relief from their aches and pains.",
            "Alright, so, I reckon the church has kinda stepped into the twenty-first century, ya know? It ain't as strict as it used to be.  See, when I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang.  Went to a fancy school, saw my buddies there every week, the whole shebang.  But now, things are different. They've got this teen thing going on, thirty minutes tops, people rocking up in their beach gear straight from the sand, families rushing in late. Even the morning masses, where I used to dress up like a princess, now everyone's in jeans and khakis.  It's way more casual, ya know?\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for the politics and whatnot, that's all a bit above my head.\n\nNow, about those priest shenanigans... I don't think  allowing women priests or letting them get hitched would've stopped all that. I mean, there are married guys out there who still get up to no good, right? It's not about being married or not.  It's about the person.\n\nPlus, becoming a priest is a choice, right? There are churches where fellas can get hitched and still preach, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\".  If someone really wants both, maybe they should check out a different faith.\n\nAs for the whole pedophilia thing, I think it's kinda in their genes, ya know? It's not like they learn it, it's just who they are. Like, look at it this way: you can't just change someone's genes by letting them get married. It might come out anyway.  \n\nIf the church knew about it and covered it up, well, that's messed up. Shame on them. But I don't think they always knew either.",
            "(laughs) \nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, at first, I was kinda okay with the whole Iraq thing, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we jumped into it all too quick. There were these justifications thrown around, connecting Iraq to Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam had WMDs.  Turns out, all that was a load of crap. It really grinds my gears, this whole Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nThe Bush administration flat out lied to the American people, and they still haven't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, remember that big UN speech he gave? He's now saying he wasn't even convinced by the evidence at the time! That's messed up, man. That's straight-up abuse of power.  They've got zero respect for the Constitution, they've been trying to sideline it ever since 9/11, at least. I think they came in wanting to go to war from day one. \n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary –  I can’t remember his name, but he wrote a book after being pushed out, basically saying the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam for his dad's time in office. Plus, I'm sure they had their eyes on Iraq's energy resources too.  Sneaky, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would be a disaster, though. The country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The UN and the US are trying to get a coalition of neighboring countries – Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing – to come in and try to stabilize things. But that doesn't feel right either. It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, and the interim government is already falling apart.\n\nThe news reports make it clear that the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister seems to have no real control.  Even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has 20 seats in Parliament! We're stuck with all these radical factions fighting for power, and it's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)\nThe real mess?  I can't even start explaining that. It's too much.",
            "I dunno, man.  This whole Iraq thing is a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, y'know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, officially.  Just this \"get back at 'em\" thing after 9/11, like they were the only ones who could've done it.  I'm not really into all the war talk, haven't been keeping up with the details. \n\nBut from what I gather, we're stuck there trying to build democracy, just so it can be another U.S. thing, plus, you know, the oil. But it's pissing everyone off, and it just feels wrong.\n\nIt's a catch-22, too. If we leave, they'll be pissed because we messed everything up and they're back to square one. And if we stay, it'll take forever to build this democracy thing, which is a whole other mess.\n\nHonestly, I'm lost. This is one topic I know nothing about.  War in Iraq?  My brain hurts just thinking about it.  \n\nMaybe it's better to just keep it going, right? Like, show them we're tough,  we're American, we got guns.  But it's messed up, it shouldn't even be called a war. Congress never even declared it, so what's the point?\n\nI feel bad for Bush, though. It's turning him into another  Nixon, another president who started a pointless war.  Like Vietnam, remember?  Ending up labeled as the \"meaningless war\" president.\n\nI don't know what to say. It's a tough one.  So many families have loved ones over there, you want them to come back safe, right? But then you think about the Iraqi people, their lives are screwed up, schools are gone, different groups fighting each other.\n\nWe're trying to force our way of life on them, like turning them into another USA.  But will that even work? It just seems like it'll make things worse, make them even angrier at us.\n\nMaybe this is just a war that'll drag on forever, a never-ending mess.",
            "My gut says it ain't right for the government to make this stuff legal.  It's right there in the Constitution, separation of church and state.  It's clear as day.  Trying to boss around what folks believe, that's against what's already written in stone.\n\nIt feels like picking sides, you know? Saying one church's beliefs are the right ones. Most Catholics and Christians I know are against this, except for maybe some folks in Boston. But who are we to tell churches what they can and can't say?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's how we keep things fair in this country. It's about letting everyone practice their faith without the government stepping in.\n\nTrying to change that with an amendment? That's crazy talk. It'd be like contradicting the whole Constitution. Plus, it'd be the only amendment that's used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nThe government shouldn't be involved.  This is a personal belief thing, like him pushing this amendment just 'cause he's Catholic. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all the others.\n\nLet the churches decide what's right for them.  That's what the Constitution is all about. There's no good reason to change that.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. From the get-go, I don't think the government was straight with the American people about why we went to war. They tried to link it to the September 11th attacks, making it seem like they were directly connected, when really, they weren't that closely tied. They used the emotions of the people who were hurting and angry after 9/11 to push the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes. This whole thing feels like a repeat of the Vietnam War, where the government made the same mistakes. It's heartbreaking to see so many American soldiers die, and the whole situation is a mess. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, and weren't ready for what came after. They didn't anticipate the power vacuum, the chaos, and the instability. \n\nIt's like what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and install democracy. They thought it would be a quick, clean victory, but it was a long, hard struggle. And just like in Vietnam, no matter how many people support you, there are always going to be insurgents who want to fight. It's hard to fight a war against a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up big time. First of all, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if they had to, they should have been prepared for everything that could go wrong. They weren't ready for the aftermath, and now we're still there in 2006, with American troops dying and trying to train Iraqi forces to take over. \n\nIt's a long process, and the US government made it seem like it would be easy. They made it seem like a quick, successful mission, but it's not that simple. Building a new government and a functioning democracy takes time, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history – it took a lot of struggle and bloodshed to get to where we are today.\n\nThe whole situation is complicated, and it's hard to know what the right decision is. On one hand, we can't just abandon Iraq after all we've done there.  On the other hand, how many more American lives are we willing to risk? How much is too much? And what about the oil? Isn't that a big factor in this whole mess?\n\nIt feels like we're just going through the motions, and there's no real end in sight. I just hope it all ends soon and that there can be some peace in Iraq. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so let me tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. It's a personal thing, ya know? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just some social thing.  It's kinda messed up to take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control. It's like, inhumane, ya know?  I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nI mean, politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's not their business. It's between two people, their families, their lives. Hell, there are a couple of gay couples right here in my neighborhood. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their day. They're not hurting anyone. So why can't they get married?\n\nThis whole \"Bush playing God\" thing and trying to twist the definition of marriage? It's ridiculous.\n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff, reports, articles, whatever - they're saying it's actually a chemical thing in your brain, like you're born that way. It's not about growing up with a bunch of sisters or not having a dad, it's different.\n\nIt's just unfair.  If a straight couple wants to get married, they can go do it in Vegas without anyone knowing. But for two gay people, it's like a national news story. It's like it should be a private thing, not something the whole world needs to know about.",
            "Okay, so, listen up.  When you drop something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. It's public, plain and simple. You can't just erase it or pretend it never happened. As an assistant, I've seen firsthand how stuff online can really mess things up.\n\nImagine posting about wanting to blow stuff up or talking about shootings. People are gonna freak out, man. Someone's bound to tell the school, and they can't just ignore it. If something bad happens, they'll be asking, \"Why didn't we do something?\"\n\nIt's a tough situation because sometimes people just mess around, right? Maybe it was a bad joke, or a sociology experiment gone wrong. But sometimes, it can be really serious. \n\nA while back, we had something similar happen at my school. Someone overheard a student talking about something scary, and they reported it. The school looked into it and found some concerning stuff on the student's Facebook. \n\nSee, when you put stuff online, you're basically waving a flag that says, \"Hey, look at me!\" You can't control how people react to it. They might take it seriously, or they might laugh it off. But the bottom line is, once it's out there, it's out there.\n\nSo, think before you post. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. And if you're talking about something serious, maybe just keep it to yourself. It's not worth the risk.",
            "This whole war thing stretches on forever, ya know? Once upon a time, I thought it had a decent purpose – bringing democracy to a place that needed it. But somewhere along the line, it feels like we lost sight of that. Now it's just about flexing our muscles, proving we're the big dogs.  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole thing started kinda shady. Remember Bush sr. and his beef with Saddam?  Maybe that's where the whole thing got twisted. If we were really trying to help, to bring freedom to a country under a cruel leader, that'd be a noble cause. But if there was personal baggage in there, that's just wrong.\n\nLook, I think we made our point those first few months, sending a message that we weren't messing around. But it's been years. Way too long. We keep plugging away at it, like we have to win this thing, but I don't even know what we're winning anymore.  \n\nIt's like we're stuck in this endless cycle of war just for the sake of war. We've got our own problems here at home – poverty, schools, healthcare – things that need our attention. Billions and billions are getting poured into this fight, when that money could be helping people right here. \n\nIt's got to end. At some point, these folks gotta figure out their own destiny. We can't be their babysitters forever. It's draining our own resources, our own soul. We need to stop throwing good money after bad and start focusing on what really matters.",
            "So, like, there's this question about privacy, right?  Someone found info online and, uh, it stopped something bad from happening.  Is that, like, an invasion of privacy?  \n\nI mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda open to everyone, y'know?  You gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends, they're seeing it.  You're giving them permission.  When you put stuff online, you gotta know a lot of people will see it.  So, if someone saw something and stopped something bad, maybe that's a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though.  You can't have someone watching everyone's profile all the time.  That'd be like picking on \"bad kids\" or something.  It wouldn't be fair.  But maybe if they had a reason to look at a specific profile, like if they had a lead on something?  I dunno.\n\nHmm, I don't have Myspace myself, but I use Facebook.  It creeps me out knowing there are weirdos out there who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV about a guy who showed how easy it was to get info from profiles.  He found a girl's screen name and was IMing her within a minute, got her to meet up!  I wouldn't do that, obviously.  But people in my classes message me on IM, even though I don't recognize their names.  It's scary because they know stuff about me - my interests, what I look like, where I am.  Photos, everything.  I try to limit what I put online, but it's hard.  I use it to talk to friends, but it's a risk, you know?  You never know who's looking.\n\nMy roommate said her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed kinda weird to me.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, talking about this war just feels messed up. I hate jumping on the bandwagon, you know?  \"Oh, I was against it from the start!\"  It's not really about that anymore.  I mean, everyone basically agrees it was a bad idea except for the people in power. They can't admit they were wrong, right?  \n\nLook at the polls! American polls, Iraqi polls, global polls – everyone thinks it was a disaster. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there think we should get out. It was a mess before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another mess.  It's just… everything in the Middle East is a minefield these days.\n\nIt all boils down to cultural clashes, I guess. The US and the Middle East are just too different. Our government thinks they can force democracy on them, but it's not their way. Saddam was a bad guy, sure, but invading a country blindly is never the answer.  It's like quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say anymore.  There's no easy solution. It all feels hopeless.  \n\nThe administration might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard a good one yet. Leaving gradually over a year or so, maybe that's okay. But just staying...   \n\nEighty percent of the Iraqi people want us gone within a year. At least a quarter of them want us out right now.  It's their country, shouldn't their voices matter?  \n\nMaybe we ask them, you know?  \"Should we leave?\" If they say yes, then it's on them, not us, if things go south. \n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least it'd be a step in the right direction.",
            "Okay, so yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women, you know?  It kind of depends on what field you're in. \n\nLike, overall, I feel women still have a tougher time because of this \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is supposed to be a thing,  a lot of guys struggle with the idea of having a woman boss them around. It's because of how society's been for so long, you know? So, sometimes women will see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just because, historically, women haven't been in those top positions. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other fields.  Take stay-at-home dads, for example. It's really uncommon for a guy to be the one staying home, and people often judge them for it.  Society thinks, \"Oh, you're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  But what if the wife has the better job, and he really wants to raise the kids? It can be tough because society doesn't really get it.\n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Guys who are straight and into fashion sometimes don't get taken seriously.  Maybe it's because guys in fashion are often seen as having a different lifestyle, and people assume they just don't \"get\" women's fashion. They question their knowledge and style.\n\nSo, yeah, I think gender discrimination is definitely still around in the U.S., and it depends on the field you're in.\n\nChanging it is hard, though. Society has a set way of thinking, and even though we've come a long way since the 1800s, change is slow. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in the business world, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more common.\n\nIt's all about slowly changing people's minds. You can't force it, or they'll resist. We're finding a good balance, though, where people are slowly starting to accept things more.",
            "Okay, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, you know? They decriminalized it. Like, it's not a crime anymore, it's more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not arrested. And that's a big deal, because those drug charges can mess you up big time, especially for job interviews and stuff.  Even with decriminalization, those worries about the future consequences, they don't just disappear.\n\nBut think about it, arresting people, booking them, holding them, the court appearances, the lawyers... it all costs a ton of money! And a lot of places, especially those struggling financially, just can't afford it. Even if it means letting go of a lot of that old, \"marijuana is evil\" thinking. \n\nDenver, though, they're a different story. More open-minded, you know?  They're probably using all that saved money now on good stuff, like schools, helping the elderly, feeding the homeless.  It's all about priorities, right?\n\nNow, I'm not saying marijuana should be everywhere, like cigarettes in gas stations. That would be weird! Plus,  it's still kinda frowned upon in a lot of places. Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol, though, that's a whole other story. It messes with your motor skills worse than weed, but marijuana can really mess with your life, your choices, your whole vibe. \n\nEveryone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle anything, others, not so much. It's a tricky thing to talk about because there's no one-size-fits-all answer.",
            "I'd say \"yeah\" to Catholicism, kinda. I mean, there are some solid things about it - like they've stuck to their traditions for ages, which can be good.  But, you gotta be able to bend a little, right? \n\nA lot of Catholics seem stuck on going to church every week and doing things *exactly* the way they always have. It feels kinda judgmental, like they look down on anyone who doesn't follow the rules perfectly or who's not a die-hard Catholic. They don't really seem to welcome people from other religions either.\n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them.  It felt pretty hypocritical to me,  cause Catholics are always saying love everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like they preach one thing, but then live another way. A lot of their rules feel totally outdated, but they cling to them anyway.\n\nI think letting priests get married could be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop the bad stuff from happening.  It's a different kind of issue.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are probably gonna do it no matter what, married or not. It's not about the marriage, it's about the sick person.",
            "Okay, so, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher for me. I haven't totally figured out where I stand yet. It's like walking a tightrope between separating church and state, and figuring out what marriage *really* is. It's tough to talk about without stepping on someone's toes, ya know? \n\nI'm not sure if marriage should be something the government defines, especially since it's considered a sacrament by some.  Think about it, if you were baptized, the government wouldn't care, right?  They wouldn't offer tax breaks or treat you differently.  So, maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in the \"type\" of marriage, just the fact that two people are united.  \n\nAs for gay marriage, well, if all the states can agree on a fair solution, maybe it should become federal law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it?  That seems crazy.  I mean, the constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people feel strongly about something.  It's a big deal for some, sure, but not big enough to rewrite the fundamental laws of the land.  It just feels wrong to me.",
            "My upbringing was in a Christian household, so the whole homosexuality thing is kinda a mixed bag for me.  I've got a bunch of gay friends, and I respect them, you know? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I totally think they should be able to do their thing. It shouldn't be a big national deal.  \n\nI think it should be left up to each state to decide, not the president. Like, wouldn't it be better if each state could choose what works best for them?  You've got your red states and your blue states, right? Blue states are more likely to be all for gay marriage, and if you live in a blue state, well, that's just how things are there. Kinda like, you chose to live there, so you gotta roll with it. \n\nI believe everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So yeah, I think gay marriage should be legal, but let each state decide. \n\nHonestly, it feels wrong for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what to think about gay marriage. It's not his call! Each state should be free to make its own rules. He doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to decide for them? \n\nAnd think about it, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democratic president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, what's it gonna be, back and forth forever? Just let the states figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, no, I don't at all. Let me see... The way I see it, Myspace is like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see, whether it's school officials or not.\n\nSo, when those officials saw it, they had every right to.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still access it from home.  But think about it, if it helps prevent a school shooting, you know, if it saves students' lives, that's the school's responsibility.  I think that's totally okay.\n\nNow, I get it, if they're just snooping around on Myspace looking for students to get in trouble for drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to make the school safer, I don't think it's an invasion at all.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you're writing things down.  \n\nAnyway, Myspace is public. Students posting stuff expecting not to get in trouble?  That's ridiculous!  I even worry about posting stuff on email. If I have something negative to say about someone, I never do it. I'm afraid someone will see it somehow.\n\nEverything comes back around these days, you know?  Like, if you do something bad in college, some big shot might find an old email and it bites you in the butt. Once it's on the internet, it's always there.  \n\nI don't think it was an invasion of privacy because, like I said, it's public. I don't think they should be constantly searching for trouble, but if they have a reason to look, to make the school safer, like preventing something horrible like Columbine, then I'm okay with it. Parents trust the school to keep their kids safe, and that's what they were trying to do.",
            "Alright, so, this whole war thing... at first, I was all for it, you know? Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I felt like we had to go over there and, like, dish out some payback. I get it, it was an emotional thing, but looking back, I think we rushed into it without thinking things through. We kinda went in blind, unprepared, without a real plan. And, honestly, it backfired big time. I mean, I was all for it at the start, but now? Totally against it. I just don't think it accomplished anything.\n\nIt's like, those people over there, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting us. Us being there just doesn't make a difference if they can't even get along with each other, you know? It's like pouring water on a fire that's already burning itself out.  \n\nAnd to be honest, because of Nine Eleven, I just... I don't care about what happens over there anymore. Those people, I just don't care. They fight amongst themselves, they can't even solve their own problems, it's just sad. \n\nWe went in there totally unprepared, didn't know what we were facing, and honestly, war is different for them than it is for us. They're just... savage. I don't think they're trying to improve their country, they just want us out of there. And maybe that's okay, maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, fueled by anger and revenge. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences, about how they would react to us trying to change their whole way of life. Bush declaring war on Iraq, well, I see where he was coming from. We couldn't just let them get away with it, right? But maybe we could've planned better, had a clearer idea of what we wanted to achieve.\n\nThere was no unity, no clear direction. We just went in there with anger and aggression, and that's what we created there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be like that, and we're just hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying. It's like a bandage on a gaping wound.  We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, it's just gonna collapse again. It's time to cut our losses and move on."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a facelift, you know?  Like, they've been droning on about losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not exactly the most open-minded bunch. They've got these super rigid views on stuff like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that everyone's entitled to their beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the dark ages! If they loosened up a tad, maybe they wouldn't be sweating so much about people ditching them.  Word on the street is a bunch of folks are ditching the Church 'cause they disagree with their stance on these hot-button issues. People are starting to feel like the Church is out of touch, and they're not keen on being told what to do. It's like, hey, if you're for abortion, you might not wanna hang out in a place that's all \"it's a sin!\"  Same goes for gay folks wanting to tie the knot.  If you're into those things, you're probably not gonna feel comfortable in a place that condemns them.  Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or let priests get hitched.  But who knows if that would've stopped the whole mess we've seen lately. It's hard to say if their current problems stem from those rules.  I mean, they might have still messed up, even if they had those things. It's a tough call.  It just seems unfair that priests have to be completely dedicated to God and can't have a normal life with a family. Everyone else gets to juggle work and personal life, why not them?",
            "Right, so, um, gay marriage, you know? I ain't against it. \n\nI figure, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like someone just decides to be gay, ya know? So, like, people shouldn't get in trouble for who they are or what they like.\n\nI mean, it seems kinda unfair, right? Like, a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two gals can't? That just seems wrong to me.  \n\nI ain't thought about it a ton, but, yeah, it's messed up to say that. It's not like you choose to be gay, like I was born straight, and someone else is born gay. It's just, well, who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong.  I don't think the government should be involved, ya know? It's not like a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really. Like, we shouldn't be putting gay folks on some kinda stage like they made a bad choice or something. That's just wrong.\n\nI don't think the government should have a say in this stuff. It's about people's lives, and, well, who they love.\n\nIt's just...weird, ya know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI mean, the government shouldn't be involved because it's not about protecting the country or anything like that. It's just about people being who they are. \n\nThey shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal, ya know?  It seems pretty clear-cut to me. Like, why not? People say gay couples are bad for families, but that's not really fair. It's just different, like two sides of the same coin - different, but still the same thing.\n\nIt's more than just that, though.  Think of all the legal stuff.  Like, if your partner is sick, they can't even be in the hospital room with you because they're not considered family. It's ridiculous if you're planning to spend your life with someone. \n\nAnd honestly, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not who you're with.  \n\nLook, they're not asking to get married in a church, they just want the legal recognition from the government.  It's like government business, not religious business.  So why do some churches, like Catholics, get so worked up about it? It's their belief, but it shouldn't dictate what the law is.\n\nIt's like segregation, you know? Separate but unequal. They're the same kind of relationship, with the same challenges and joys.  People worry about adoption and kids, but studies show that kids raised by gay parents are just fine. It's all about love and care, not who's giving it.\n\nI think the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and fairness. It's not right that one group's beliefs are forced on everyone else.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or broken, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said it's not a choice or a defect. People need to listen to experts, not just what their friends or church say. It's about time we treat everyone equally.",
            "Alright, so listen, I sling meds at a hospital pharmacy, and let me tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good in it. Like, I wouldn't wanna see it out on the streets for anyone to grab, nah, no way. But for doctors to use it to help patients?  Absolutely, I'm all for it.  'Cause, come on, just 'cause something's outlawed doesn't mean it's useless.\n\nThink about it, we pharmacies use all kinds of heavy-duty stuff, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet,  you know, the good stuff. They're controlled, sure, but they're lifesavers for a lot of folks. So, if we're gonna throw the book at marijuana just 'cause it's got a bad rap, that ain't right. We gotta look at the good it can do.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's like alcohol, 'cause yeah, too much of anything's bad. But, you know, it's a whole different beast. Maybe we should ease into it, make it legal, step by step. That way, people can learn to use it right, without going overboard.\n\nThe thing is, people see marijuana and they think, \"Drugs, bad!\" But it ain't no heroin or cocaine, you know? It ain't that scary. If we stop paintin' it as the devil's lettuce, maybe folks will chill out, use it responsibly, and maybe even find some relief from their aches and pains.",
            "Alright, so, I reckon the church has kinda stepped into the twenty-first century, ya know? It ain't as strict as it used to be.  See, when I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang.  Went to a fancy school, saw my buddies there every week, the whole shebang.  But now, things are different. They've got this teen thing going on, thirty minutes tops, people rocking up in their beach gear straight from the sand, families rushing in late. Even the morning masses, where I used to dress up like a princess, now everyone's in jeans and khakis.  It's way more casual, ya know?\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for the politics and whatnot, that's all a bit above my head.\n\nNow, about those priest shenanigans... I don't think  allowing women priests or letting them get hitched would've stopped all that. I mean, there are married guys out there who still get up to no good, right? It's not about being married or not.  It's about the person.\n\nPlus, becoming a priest is a choice, right? There are churches where fellas can get hitched and still preach, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\".  If someone really wants both, maybe they should check out a different faith.\n\nAs for the whole pedophilia thing, I think it's kinda in their genes, ya know? It's not like they learn it, it's just who they are. Like, look at it this way: you can't just change someone's genes by letting them get married. It might come out anyway.  \n\nIf the church knew about it and covered it up, well, that's messed up. Shame on them. But I don't think they always knew either.",
            "(laughs) \nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, at first, I was kinda okay with the whole Iraq thing, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we jumped into it all too quick. There were these justifications thrown around, connecting Iraq to Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam had WMDs.  Turns out, all that was a load of crap. It really grinds my gears, this whole Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nThe Bush administration flat out lied to the American people, and they still haven't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, remember that big UN speech he gave? He's now saying he wasn't even convinced by the evidence at the time! That's messed up, man. That's straight-up abuse of power.  They've got zero respect for the Constitution, they've been trying to sideline it ever since 9/11, at least. I think they came in wanting to go to war from day one. \n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary –  I can’t remember his name, but he wrote a book after being pushed out, basically saying the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam for his dad's time in office. Plus, I'm sure they had their eyes on Iraq's energy resources too.  Sneaky, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would be a disaster, though. The country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The UN and the US are trying to get a coalition of neighboring countries – Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing – to come in and try to stabilize things. But that doesn't feel right either. It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, and the interim government is already falling apart.\n\nThe news reports make it clear that the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister seems to have no real control.  Even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has 20 seats in Parliament! We're stuck with all these radical factions fighting for power, and it's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)\nThe real mess?  I can't even start explaining that. It's too much.",
            "I dunno, man.  This whole Iraq thing is a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, y'know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, officially.  Just this \"get back at 'em\" thing after 9/11, like they were the only ones who could've done it.  I'm not really into all the war talk, haven't been keeping up with the details. \n\nBut from what I gather, we're stuck there trying to build democracy, just so it can be another U.S. thing, plus, you know, the oil. But it's pissing everyone off, and it just feels wrong.\n\nIt's a catch-22, too. If we leave, they'll be pissed because we messed everything up and they're back to square one. And if we stay, it'll take forever to build this democracy thing, which is a whole other mess.\n\nHonestly, I'm lost. This is one topic I know nothing about.  War in Iraq?  My brain hurts just thinking about it.  \n\nMaybe it's better to just keep it going, right? Like, show them we're tough,  we're American, we got guns.  But it's messed up, it shouldn't even be called a war. Congress never even declared it, so what's the point?\n\nI feel bad for Bush, though. It's turning him into another  Nixon, another president who started a pointless war.  Like Vietnam, remember?  Ending up labeled as the \"meaningless war\" president.\n\nI don't know what to say. It's a tough one.  So many families have loved ones over there, you want them to come back safe, right? But then you think about the Iraqi people, their lives are screwed up, schools are gone, different groups fighting each other.\n\nWe're trying to force our way of life on them, like turning them into another USA.  But will that even work? It just seems like it'll make things worse, make them even angrier at us.\n\nMaybe this is just a war that'll drag on forever, a never-ending mess.",
            "My gut says it ain't right for the government to make this stuff legal.  It's right there in the Constitution, separation of church and state.  It's clear as day.  Trying to boss around what folks believe, that's against what's already written in stone.\n\nIt feels like picking sides, you know? Saying one church's beliefs are the right ones. Most Catholics and Christians I know are against this, except for maybe some folks in Boston. But who are we to tell churches what they can and can't say?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's how we keep things fair in this country. It's about letting everyone practice their faith without the government stepping in.\n\nTrying to change that with an amendment? That's crazy talk. It'd be like contradicting the whole Constitution. Plus, it'd be the only amendment that's used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nThe government shouldn't be involved.  This is a personal belief thing, like him pushing this amendment just 'cause he's Catholic. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all the others.\n\nLet the churches decide what's right for them.  That's what the Constitution is all about. There's no good reason to change that.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. From the get-go, I don't think the government was straight with the American people about why we went to war. They tried to link it to the September 11th attacks, making it seem like they were directly connected, when really, they weren't that closely tied. They used the emotions of the people who were hurting and angry after 9/11 to push the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes. This whole thing feels like a repeat of the Vietnam War, where the government made the same mistakes. It's heartbreaking to see so many American soldiers die, and the whole situation is a mess. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, and weren't ready for what came after. They didn't anticipate the power vacuum, the chaos, and the instability. \n\nIt's like what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and install democracy. They thought it would be a quick, clean victory, but it was a long, hard struggle. And just like in Vietnam, no matter how many people support you, there are always going to be insurgents who want to fight. It's hard to fight a war against a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up big time. First of all, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if they had to, they should have been prepared for everything that could go wrong. They weren't ready for the aftermath, and now we're still there in 2006, with American troops dying and trying to train Iraqi forces to take over. \n\nIt's a long process, and the US government made it seem like it would be easy. They made it seem like a quick, successful mission, but it's not that simple. Building a new government and a functioning democracy takes time, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history – it took a lot of struggle and bloodshed to get to where we are today.\n\nThe whole situation is complicated, and it's hard to know what the right decision is. On one hand, we can't just abandon Iraq after all we've done there.  On the other hand, how many more American lives are we willing to risk? How much is too much? And what about the oil? Isn't that a big factor in this whole mess?\n\nIt feels like we're just going through the motions, and there's no real end in sight. I just hope it all ends soon and that there can be some peace in Iraq. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so let me tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. It's a personal thing, ya know? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just some social thing.  It's kinda messed up to take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control. It's like, inhumane, ya know?  I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nI mean, politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's not their business. It's between two people, their families, their lives. Hell, there are a couple of gay couples right here in my neighborhood. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their day. They're not hurting anyone. So why can't they get married?\n\nThis whole \"Bush playing God\" thing and trying to twist the definition of marriage? It's ridiculous.\n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff, reports, articles, whatever - they're saying it's actually a chemical thing in your brain, like you're born that way. It's not about growing up with a bunch of sisters or not having a dad, it's different.\n\nIt's just unfair.  If a straight couple wants to get married, they can go do it in Vegas without anyone knowing. But for two gay people, it's like a national news story. It's like it should be a private thing, not something the whole world needs to know about.",
            "Okay, so, listen up.  When you drop something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. It's public, plain and simple. You can't just erase it or pretend it never happened. As an assistant, I've seen firsthand how stuff online can really mess things up.\n\nImagine posting about wanting to blow stuff up or talking about shootings. People are gonna freak out, man. Someone's bound to tell the school, and they can't just ignore it. If something bad happens, they'll be asking, \"Why didn't we do something?\"\n\nIt's a tough situation because sometimes people just mess around, right? Maybe it was a bad joke, or a sociology experiment gone wrong. But sometimes, it can be really serious. \n\nA while back, we had something similar happen at my school. Someone overheard a student talking about something scary, and they reported it. The school looked into it and found some concerning stuff on the student's Facebook. \n\nSee, when you put stuff online, you're basically waving a flag that says, \"Hey, look at me!\" You can't control how people react to it. They might take it seriously, or they might laugh it off. But the bottom line is, once it's out there, it's out there.\n\nSo, think before you post. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. And if you're talking about something serious, maybe just keep it to yourself. It's not worth the risk.",
            "This whole war thing stretches on forever, ya know? Once upon a time, I thought it had a decent purpose – bringing democracy to a place that needed it. But somewhere along the line, it feels like we lost sight of that. Now it's just about flexing our muscles, proving we're the big dogs.  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole thing started kinda shady. Remember Bush sr. and his beef with Saddam?  Maybe that's where the whole thing got twisted. If we were really trying to help, to bring freedom to a country under a cruel leader, that'd be a noble cause. But if there was personal baggage in there, that's just wrong.\n\nLook, I think we made our point those first few months, sending a message that we weren't messing around. But it's been years. Way too long. We keep plugging away at it, like we have to win this thing, but I don't even know what we're winning anymore.  \n\nIt's like we're stuck in this endless cycle of war just for the sake of war. We've got our own problems here at home – poverty, schools, healthcare – things that need our attention. Billions and billions are getting poured into this fight, when that money could be helping people right here. \n\nIt's got to end. At some point, these folks gotta figure out their own destiny. We can't be their babysitters forever. It's draining our own resources, our own soul. We need to stop throwing good money after bad and start focusing on what really matters.",
            "So, like, there's this question about privacy, right?  Someone found info online and, uh, it stopped something bad from happening.  Is that, like, an invasion of privacy?  \n\nI mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda open to everyone, y'know?  You gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends, they're seeing it.  You're giving them permission.  When you put stuff online, you gotta know a lot of people will see it.  So, if someone saw something and stopped something bad, maybe that's a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though.  You can't have someone watching everyone's profile all the time.  That'd be like picking on \"bad kids\" or something.  It wouldn't be fair.  But maybe if they had a reason to look at a specific profile, like if they had a lead on something?  I dunno.\n\nHmm, I don't have Myspace myself, but I use Facebook.  It creeps me out knowing there are weirdos out there who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV about a guy who showed how easy it was to get info from profiles.  He found a girl's screen name and was IMing her within a minute, got her to meet up!  I wouldn't do that, obviously.  But people in my classes message me on IM, even though I don't recognize their names.  It's scary because they know stuff about me - my interests, what I look like, where I am.  Photos, everything.  I try to limit what I put online, but it's hard.  I use it to talk to friends, but it's a risk, you know?  You never know who's looking.\n\nMy roommate said her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed kinda weird to me.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, talking about this war just feels messed up. I hate jumping on the bandwagon, you know?  \"Oh, I was against it from the start!\"  It's not really about that anymore.  I mean, everyone basically agrees it was a bad idea except for the people in power. They can't admit they were wrong, right?  \n\nLook at the polls! American polls, Iraqi polls, global polls – everyone thinks it was a disaster. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there think we should get out. It was a mess before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another mess.  It's just… everything in the Middle East is a minefield these days.\n\nIt all boils down to cultural clashes, I guess. The US and the Middle East are just too different. Our government thinks they can force democracy on them, but it's not their way. Saddam was a bad guy, sure, but invading a country blindly is never the answer.  It's like quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say anymore.  There's no easy solution. It all feels hopeless.  \n\nThe administration might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard a good one yet. Leaving gradually over a year or so, maybe that's okay. But just staying...   \n\nEighty percent of the Iraqi people want us gone within a year. At least a quarter of them want us out right now.  It's their country, shouldn't their voices matter?  \n\nMaybe we ask them, you know?  \"Should we leave?\" If they say yes, then it's on them, not us, if things go south. \n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least it'd be a step in the right direction.",
            "Okay, so yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women, you know?  It kind of depends on what field you're in. \n\nLike, overall, I feel women still have a tougher time because of this \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is supposed to be a thing,  a lot of guys struggle with the idea of having a woman boss them around. It's because of how society's been for so long, you know? So, sometimes women will see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just because, historically, women haven't been in those top positions. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other fields.  Take stay-at-home dads, for example. It's really uncommon for a guy to be the one staying home, and people often judge them for it.  Society thinks, \"Oh, you're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  But what if the wife has the better job, and he really wants to raise the kids? It can be tough because society doesn't really get it.\n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Guys who are straight and into fashion sometimes don't get taken seriously.  Maybe it's because guys in fashion are often seen as having a different lifestyle, and people assume they just don't \"get\" women's fashion. They question their knowledge and style.\n\nSo, yeah, I think gender discrimination is definitely still around in the U.S., and it depends on the field you're in.\n\nChanging it is hard, though. Society has a set way of thinking, and even though we've come a long way since the 1800s, change is slow. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in the business world, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more common.\n\nIt's all about slowly changing people's minds. You can't force it, or they'll resist. We're finding a good balance, though, where people are slowly starting to accept things more.",
            "Okay, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, you know? They decriminalized it. Like, it's not a crime anymore, it's more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not arrested. And that's a big deal, because those drug charges can mess you up big time, especially for job interviews and stuff.  Even with decriminalization, those worries about the future consequences, they don't just disappear.\n\nBut think about it, arresting people, booking them, holding them, the court appearances, the lawyers... it all costs a ton of money! And a lot of places, especially those struggling financially, just can't afford it. Even if it means letting go of a lot of that old, \"marijuana is evil\" thinking. \n\nDenver, though, they're a different story. More open-minded, you know?  They're probably using all that saved money now on good stuff, like schools, helping the elderly, feeding the homeless.  It's all about priorities, right?\n\nNow, I'm not saying marijuana should be everywhere, like cigarettes in gas stations. That would be weird! Plus,  it's still kinda frowned upon in a lot of places. Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol, though, that's a whole other story. It messes with your motor skills worse than weed, but marijuana can really mess with your life, your choices, your whole vibe. \n\nEveryone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle anything, others, not so much. It's a tricky thing to talk about because there's no one-size-fits-all answer.",
            "I'd say \"yeah\" to Catholicism, kinda. I mean, there are some solid things about it - like they've stuck to their traditions for ages, which can be good.  But, you gotta be able to bend a little, right? \n\nA lot of Catholics seem stuck on going to church every week and doing things *exactly* the way they always have. It feels kinda judgmental, like they look down on anyone who doesn't follow the rules perfectly or who's not a die-hard Catholic. They don't really seem to welcome people from other religions either.\n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them.  It felt pretty hypocritical to me,  cause Catholics are always saying love everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like they preach one thing, but then live another way. A lot of their rules feel totally outdated, but they cling to them anyway.\n\nI think letting priests get married could be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop the bad stuff from happening.  It's a different kind of issue.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are probably gonna do it no matter what, married or not. It's not about the marriage, it's about the sick person.",
            "Okay, so, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher for me. I haven't totally figured out where I stand yet. It's like walking a tightrope between separating church and state, and figuring out what marriage *really* is. It's tough to talk about without stepping on someone's toes, ya know? \n\nI'm not sure if marriage should be something the government defines, especially since it's considered a sacrament by some.  Think about it, if you were baptized, the government wouldn't care, right?  They wouldn't offer tax breaks or treat you differently.  So, maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in the \"type\" of marriage, just the fact that two people are united.  \n\nAs for gay marriage, well, if all the states can agree on a fair solution, maybe it should become federal law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it?  That seems crazy.  I mean, the constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people feel strongly about something.  It's a big deal for some, sure, but not big enough to rewrite the fundamental laws of the land.  It just feels wrong to me.",
            "My upbringing was in a Christian household, so the whole homosexuality thing is kinda a mixed bag for me.  I've got a bunch of gay friends, and I respect them, you know? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I totally think they should be able to do their thing. It shouldn't be a big national deal.  \n\nI think it should be left up to each state to decide, not the president. Like, wouldn't it be better if each state could choose what works best for them?  You've got your red states and your blue states, right? Blue states are more likely to be all for gay marriage, and if you live in a blue state, well, that's just how things are there. Kinda like, you chose to live there, so you gotta roll with it. \n\nI believe everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So yeah, I think gay marriage should be legal, but let each state decide. \n\nHonestly, it feels wrong for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what to think about gay marriage. It's not his call! Each state should be free to make its own rules. He doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to decide for them? \n\nAnd think about it, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democratic president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, what's it gonna be, back and forth forever? Just let the states figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, no, I don't at all. Let me see... The way I see it, Myspace is like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see, whether it's school officials or not.\n\nSo, when those officials saw it, they had every right to.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still access it from home.  But think about it, if it helps prevent a school shooting, you know, if it saves students' lives, that's the school's responsibility.  I think that's totally okay.\n\nNow, I get it, if they're just snooping around on Myspace looking for students to get in trouble for drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to make the school safer, I don't think it's an invasion at all.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you're writing things down.  \n\nAnyway, Myspace is public. Students posting stuff expecting not to get in trouble?  That's ridiculous!  I even worry about posting stuff on email. If I have something negative to say about someone, I never do it. I'm afraid someone will see it somehow.\n\nEverything comes back around these days, you know?  Like, if you do something bad in college, some big shot might find an old email and it bites you in the butt. Once it's on the internet, it's always there.  \n\nI don't think it was an invasion of privacy because, like I said, it's public. I don't think they should be constantly searching for trouble, but if they have a reason to look, to make the school safer, like preventing something horrible like Columbine, then I'm okay with it. Parents trust the school to keep their kids safe, and that's what they were trying to do.",
            "Alright, so, this whole war thing... at first, I was all for it, you know? Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I felt like we had to go over there and, like, dish out some payback. I get it, it was an emotional thing, but looking back, I think we rushed into it without thinking things through. We kinda went in blind, unprepared, without a real plan. And, honestly, it backfired big time. I mean, I was all for it at the start, but now? Totally against it. I just don't think it accomplished anything.\n\nIt's like, those people over there, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting us. Us being there just doesn't make a difference if they can't even get along with each other, you know? It's like pouring water on a fire that's already burning itself out.  \n\nAnd to be honest, because of Nine Eleven, I just... I don't care about what happens over there anymore. Those people, I just don't care. They fight amongst themselves, they can't even solve their own problems, it's just sad. \n\nWe went in there totally unprepared, didn't know what we were facing, and honestly, war is different for them than it is for us. They're just... savage. I don't think they're trying to improve their country, they just want us out of there. And maybe that's okay, maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, fueled by anger and revenge. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences, about how they would react to us trying to change their whole way of life. Bush declaring war on Iraq, well, I see where he was coming from. We couldn't just let them get away with it, right? But maybe we could've planned better, had a clearer idea of what we wanted to achieve.\n\nThere was no unity, no clear direction. We just went in there with anger and aggression, and that's what we created there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be like that, and we're just hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying. It's like a bandage on a gaping wound.  We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, it's just gonna collapse again. It's time to cut our losses and move on."
