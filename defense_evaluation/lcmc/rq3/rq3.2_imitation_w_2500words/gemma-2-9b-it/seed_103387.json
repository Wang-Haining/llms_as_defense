            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so I think the Catholic Church needs to evolve a bit, you know? Like, I hear they're losing followers, and I think it might be because some of their views are, well, a little stuck in the past.  \n\nTake gay marriage, abortion, birth control – these are hot button issues, and the Church's stance on them is pretty strong.  Now, they have the right to their beliefs, but maybe if they opened their minds a little, they wouldn't be losing so many people.  \n\nI hear folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with how they handle these things.  It's like, if the Church says abortion is wrong and you believe it's okay, you might not feel comfortable being part of that group. Same with gay marriage – if that's something you support, you might not want to belong to a place that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married.  It's not like those things would magically solve all their problems, but maybe it would help.  Like, maybe if priests had families, they wouldn't be so quick to, you know, *do those things*.  I mean, it's hard to say for sure, right?",
            "So, like, gay marriage, huh? Well, I ain't sayin' it's wrong, you know? I dunno, maybe it's somethin' you're just born with, like, not a choice, ya dig? Like, I was born straight, and some folks are born gay, right?  Seems kinda unfair to hold 'em responsible for somethin' they weren't choosin',  y'know?\n\nIt just seems messed up to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two ladies can't.  Haven't really thought too hard about it, but it feels wrong,  ya know?\n\nIt's like, they don't get to pick who they're attracted to,  it's just how they are.  I mean, shouldn't we be cool with that? Shouldn't the government stay outta people's love lives?  It ain't like it's threatenin' national security or nothin'. Seems kinda private, y'know?\n\nIt's like, why put 'em on a stage and make 'em feel bad for  who they are? Like they made a wrong choice or somethin'.  Nah, man, that ain't right.  Let 'em live their lives,  love who they love,  it's not hurtin' nobody.",
            "So, I'm all for gay marriage, ya know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are gonna mess up straight families, but come on! It's just not the same thing.  It's like two sides of the same coin – different, but still connected.  \n\nThere's a whole bunch of rights that come with marriage, like property and healthcare. Think about it, if your partner's gay, they can't even visit you in the hospital! It's crazy, right? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and healthy as straight ones.  They've got the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat bugs me is that folks get hung up on the religious angle.  Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church – they just want a legal document, something the government issues.  If the government isn't involved in religion, why should it matter?\n\nIt's like segregation – separating people based on who they are isn't fair. Gay couples are just like straight couples – they have the same roles, the same dynamics.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and kids. Will they be okay? But the truth is, parenting skills are the same, whether you're gay or straight.  It's about love and care, not orientation.  Plus, some kids of gay parents face bullying in schools. It's heartbreaking, and it shouldn't be happening.\n\nLook, I think the government needs to step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about equality and treating everyone fairly.  President Bush seems to have strong religious views that get in the way, but morality is subjective! It's not something the government should be dictating.  \n\nSome folks think being gay is a psychological problem, but the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. We need to listen to experts and evidence, not just rumors and prejudice.",
            "Alright, so listen up, I work in a hospital pharmacy, you know?  See, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's all bad. Like,  I think making drugs available to everyone is a big no-no, but for medical uses?  Totally a yes. Cause come on, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good uses, right? It's not like it's inherently bad.  \n\nI mean, think about it,  we pharmacies use all kinds of crazy drugs that are totally illegal, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, all that jazz. They're controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why not give marijuana the same chance, ya know? \n\nPeople get all hung up on it being taboo, but it ain't like alcohol. Sure, alcohol can be bad too, but weed, if you mess with it too much, it's not gonna kill ya like some hard stuff. It's a tricky thing, I guess. Maybe we should legalize it little by little, not all at once, so folks don't go crazy. But first, we gotta ditch that whole scary \"Reefer Madness\" vibe, ya know? \n\nPeople freak out about marijuana 'cause it's illegal, but honestly, it ain't as bad as heroin or cocaine.  If we stop picturing it as this evil drug, maybe people will use it responsibly. And for medical stuff?  Definitely.",
            "So, I think the church has totally changed with the times, you know? It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was a kid, every Sunday was a big deal - cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too. We'd go to church every week, but now things are different. \n\nThey've got this teen mass thing, which is only like thirty minutes long. People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. I've seen people show up straight from the beach! And even at the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, people are rocking jeans and khakis now.  \n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. As for all the other stuff, like the scandals with priests, well, I don't really know about all that political stuff. But yeah, the church seems a lot more laid-back these days.",
            "(laughs)\n\nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, the whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil. At first, I was kinda okay with the idea, but then 9/11 happened, and everything changed. It felt like we rushed into this war, using 9/11 as a smokescreen.\n\nThey kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but that's all been proven false. The Bush administration straight up lied to us, and they haven't even admitted it! It's like they don't even care about the Constitution.\n\nI mean, even Colin Powell, remember that big speech he gave at the UN? Now he says he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong. That's a crime, plain and simple.\n\nIt feels like they came into office wanting to go to war, and they twisted everything to make it happen. I heard this one guy, a former Treasury Secretary, said they were practically itching for a fight. And don't even get me started on the whole oil thing – using a war to control resources? So shady.\n\nIt's been going on for way too long. Pulling out now would be messy, though, probably cause a civil war and more deaths. But sending in Syria and Saudi Arabia to \"fix\" things? That doesn't feel right either. It's like they're just going to keep meddling in Iraq's affairs, and that's not good for anyone.\n\nAnd the Iraqi government? What a mess! Parliament's useless, the Prime Minister has no real power, and these radical groups are running wild. It's like a powder keg waiting to explode.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq?  Man, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, you know?  I mean, it wasn't even a real war, officially. It just felt like a \"get back at Iraq\" thing, like they were the ones behind 9/11. \n\nHonestly, I'm not really into politics or keeping up with all the details. But it seems like we're still there trying to build a democracy, like we want Iraq to become another USA. And, let's be real, oil is a big part of it too. \n\nThe thing is, it's making everyone mad.  We can't just force democracy on them overnight. It takes time, and if we leave before it's set, they'll be even more messed up.  It's a real catch-22.\n\nSee, I'm not good with tough topics like this. It's so complicated! \n\nBut I guess I feel like we should stay, help them out, but it's a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, kind of like how Vietnam is still seen as a bad thing.\n\nOn the other hand, I know there are families with loved ones in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. \n\nIt's a mess! They have their own culture, and we're trying to force ours on them. It just feels like it's making things worse, stirring up more hatred.\n\nI think this war will drag on forever, and nobody wins in the end. It's a real bummer.",
            "Ugh, I just can't see how legalizing it is right. It feels wrong, like the government overstepping its bounds. The Constitution, man, it's crystal clear about separating church and state. They're trying to force their beliefs on everyone, picking and choosing which churches get to decide what's right and wrong. It's like saying Catholics get to rule the roost on this one, even though most of them are against it.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is what makes this country great, you know? It lets everyone practice their faith freely.  Trying to change that with an amendment feels like going against everything the Constitution stands for. Plus, wouldn't it be the first amendment ever meant to restrict people instead of the government?  \n\nThis whole thing just feels off. The government shouldn't be telling churches what they can and can't do. It should be up to them, not some politician pushing his own beliefs, especially when they go against the grain of what the Constitution already says.  \n\nI just don't see how it impacts the economy or anything else. Maybe even a positive vibe, who knows? It's all about personal choice, not government interference.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  Let me tell ya, I don't think the government straight up told the American people the whole truth about why we went in there. They tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, but honestly, those two things weren't really connected. The government played on people's emotions, you know? They were angry after 9/11, and they used that anger to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam – another mistake the government should've learned from.  Tons of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and just ripped out Iraq's government without a solid plan for what would happen next. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt. Now we're stuck there trying to put in a democracy, which is a tough job, even in a country that's ready for it.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – trying to push out communism and force democracy on a people who weren't ready for it. It wasn't a clear victory, more like a long, painful loss. You can't just win hearts and minds by force.  Even if some people support you, there are always going to be insurgents fighting back. It's impossible to fight a whole nation.\n\nThe government should've known this going in.  They should've planned for all the possibilities.  They made it seem like this would be a quick, clean win, but it's been dragging on forever.  We're still there in 2006, American troops are still dying, and the Iraqi government is still struggling to hold together.\n\nIt's a tough situation.  I mean, we can't just leave them now after all the chaos we've unleashed. But how long can we keep putting our own people at risk for a country that might never be truly free?\n\nAnd then there's the whole oil thing. Are we really fighting this war for democracy, or are we fighting for access to their resources? We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, and we didn't do anything about it. It's all about money and control, isn't it?",
            "So, you know, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I really think it's a personal preference, something that science is showing is more likely biological than anything else.  To take away someone's rights because of something they can't control, something that's part of who they are, feels just plain wrong to me. It's like, inhuman, you know? I've always been a supporter of gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. This is a personal thing, a family thing. It's not something the state should be dictating. At home, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of gay couples who are together, but can't get married because the law won't let them. They live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go to work, they're part of the community. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. It's people's lives, their love, their commitment.  \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how studies are showing that there's a biological basis for being gay, something that's in your brain chemistry. It's like you're born that way, not something you choose. It's not about how you were raised or your environment. \n\nBesides the obvious,  it just feels… yeah, like it's a private matter. A guy and a girl can marry without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to get married, it's a huge deal. It's like they're making a public spectacle out of it when it should just be a personal celebration.  It should be kept in the private realm, not splashed all over the news.",
            "Alright, listen up. When you chuck something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. It's public, plain and simple. \n\nBeing an RA, I've seen this firsthand.  Whatever you put online, it sticks. People will judge you based on it. If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shooting things, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss these things out there. The internet's a wild beast; everyone's got a peek. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, you get their updates.\n\nNow, the school probably didn't get an official warning from Myspace. Someone saw something, got worried, and told the school. They had to act, you know?  Imagine if something bad happened, and they could have stopped it?  \n\nBut, here's the catch - sometimes people mess around, right? They joke around, and it can get misinterpreted. Like, maybe it was just a crazed sociology project gone wrong. Or maybe, just maybe, it was something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone heard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked through the kid's Facebook, and found some stuff that, in light of the situation, was pretty darn scary. It might have been a joke, but it looked bad.\n\nThe thing is, once you put something online, there's no privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it! Don't expect to control what people think.\n\nNow, I'm not saying school officials should be stalking their students on Facebook. That's creepy! But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously. \n\nI mean, I don't think they should be snooping through texts or IMs unless they have a good reason. But if something's brought up, they have to investigate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.",
            "Right, so I feel like this whole war has dragged on for far too long.  At the start, I get it, there was a good reason, right?  Helping another country get its democracy going.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just in it because we have to be, like we're trying to prove we're the big dogs.  Plus, the whole thing started because of, you know, whatever issues Bush Sr. had with Saddam back in the day. So maybe the reasons we started this weren't so pure to begin with.\n\nIf the goal was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have one, that's a good thing, a righteous thing. But I don't think that's what's happening anymore. It's like we've lost our way, and now it's all about winning, about not backing down, even though it's been going on for years.\n\nListen, maybe in those first few months, dropping that bombshell made a statement, but come on, it's been way too long.  Their government, their people, they have to figure things out on their own eventually. We can't keep throwing money and lives into this thing forever.\n\nThink about it: we're spending billions and billions, money that could be helping people here at home.  We have our own problems, poverty, things we need to fix, but instead, we're pouring it all into this war that doesn't even have a clear purpose anymore.\n\nWe need to stop. We need to bring our troops home. There comes a point where you just have to say enough is enough. We can't keep bleeding money and lives for a war we've already lost.",
            "So, lemme ask,  you know, there was this thing, right?  Seems like someone saw somethin' online, like on Myspace, and it, like, stopped some bad stuff from happening. I get that it's kind of a bummer, ya know, people lookin' at your stuff without permission. But isn't Myspace kinda public, like, if you put it out there, it's kinda fair game?\n\nI mean, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you chose to be their friend, right?  So it's kinda like givin' them the okay to see that stuff.\n\nIt's like, anything you put online, you gotta expect that some folks might see it.\n\nI guess if someone saw somethin' that could've saved someone's life, that's a good thing, right?\n\nBut,  uh, it's tough, right?  I mean, you can't have someone watchin' everyone's Myspace all day, lookin' for trouble.\n\nThat'd be like, pickin' on the \"bad kids\" or somethin'.\n\nI don't know, maybe it depends on the situation.\n\nLike, were they lookin' for somethin' specific, or just snoopin'?\n\nI don't know, it's a sticky wicket.\n\nMe, I don't have Myspace, but I got Facebook.\n\nIt freaks me out a little thinkin' about creeps out there seein' my stuff.\n\nI saw this thing on TV once, about this dude who could find people's info real fast, like, got their screen name and started talkin' to 'em on IM in like, less than a minute, and got 'em to meet up.\n\nI wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes IM'in me, and they know it's me, even though I don't recognize their names.\n\nIt's creepy, 'cause they know all about you, your classes, your friends, your photos. \n\nI try to keep it clean, but it's hard, 'cause Facebook is supposed to be for connectin' with friends.\n\nSo, it's a double-edged sword, ya know?\n\nYou put stuff out there, you gotta expect some folks might see it.\n\n I heard my roommate talkin' about her high school, they banned Myspace.\n\nThat's kinda weird, right? How can they tell you what you can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing makes me want to pull my hair out.  It feels hypocritical even talking about it, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start.  I mean, I was, but honestly, does it even matter now?  It's like everyone knows it was a bad idea except for those in charge who just can't admit they messed up. \n\nYou look at the polls, it's insane.  Everywhere you look, seventy-five to eighty percent of people think it was a disaster – Iraqis, Americans, even the troops over there.  They want out!  And who can blame them?  It's been a train wreck from day one, and pulling out is just gonna be another dumpster fire.  The Middle East is a tangled mess, and our culture just clashes so badly with theirs.  It's like these politicians think they can just force democracy on them, but it's not that simple.  It's their culture, their way of life, and it's not like they asked for our help.\n\nSure, Saddam was a jerk, no question.  But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country, and this was just a recipe for disaster.  It's like quicksand, the deeper we get, the harder it is to get out.  \n\nHonestly, I don't even know what to say anymore.  I can't see any reason to stay there, and I haven't heard a single good reason from the administration.  Maybe a slow pullout over a year or so wouldn't be so bad, but just leaving now?  I think the people of Iraq deserve a say in this, and if they want us gone, maybe we should listen.  At least then we can wash our hands of it and say, \"We gave you the chance, but you chose to go your own way.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do.  But at least this way we'd be less of a problem.",
            "Ya know what? I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women. It's more like, depending on the field you're in, you know? Like for women, there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  \n\nMen sometimes have a hard time taking orders from a woman, just because of how things have always been. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't promote her because, well, history tells them women aren't supposed to be in charge. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other areas. Think about stay-at-home dads. It's super rare for a guy to be the one at home with the kids. People often judge them, thinking, \"Shouldn't the man be out earning money?\"  It can be tough on them when their dream is to raise their kids and their wife has the better job, even if it all works out great for their family. Society just doesn't get it. \n\nAnd in fashion? Guys can get overlooked if they're straight. Not sure if that makes sense, but people might think, \"How can a guy *really* understand fashion if he's not a woman?\" It's like, \"Oh, you're not like the other guys, so you must not know what you're talking about.\"\n\nSo yeah, depending on what you do, there's definitely gender discrimination.  Changing it is slow, though. We've come a long way from the 1800s for sure, but people have set ways of thinking.  Slowly, women are climbing the corporate ladder, becoming CEOs, and being accepted in business.  More men are becoming stay-at-home dads, and people are starting to see that it can work.  \n\nI think it's all about showing the good qualities of those who are stereotyped.  If you push too hard, people resist. We're finding a balance, but change takes time.",
            "So, get this, they didn't exactly legalize it, more like took the handcuffs off, y'know? Demystified it, turned it from a full-blown criminal offense to, like, a parking ticket.  You get a slap on the wrist instead of being thrown in the slammer. But here's the kicker, man, even with this decriminalization thing, the fear of a drug charge still lingers. Job interviews, background checks, all that jazz. It's a shadow that follows you, even if you're not facing jail time.  \n\nIt's crazy, right?  Think about it, the system spends a fortune locking people up for weed.  Courts, lawyers, housing, the whole nine yards. Where's that money going? Could it be going towards, you know, helping people instead of punishing them?  \n\nSeems like cities struggling financially could really use that cash. But then again, some places are just dead set against marijuana, no matter what. It's like a principle thing.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, I think it's a win-win. More money for schools, social programs, helping those in need.  It's a step in the right direction. \n\nBut let's be real, we don't want weed everywhere, blowing up like cigarettes in gas stations. There are valid concerns about that. It's still a bit taboo in many circles. Imagine the awkwardness, right? \n\nAnd alcohol, that's a different beast.  It messes with your motor skills more directly.  But marijuana, it can mess with your life in other ways, your choices, your priorities.  \n\nIt's a double-edged sword, man.  It affects everyone differently. Some people are responsible, some go overboard. It's hard to say for sure what the right answer is.",
            "I reckon I'd say yes, mostly because a lot of their traditions are pretty solid, like they've been doing the same stuff for ages. That's cool, you know, having roots. But it's also gotta be alright to change with the times, right? \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know feel this pressure to go to church every week, and there's a real strictness around how things are done. It's like they judge folks who don't follow every single rule perfectly. They don't seem too keen on folks who aren't, like, totally Catholic either, you know? And they don't really roll out the welcome mat for people from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Talk about not being open-minded, right?  We were always taught to love everyone, which is a big Catholic thing. But it feels kinda bogus when they preach that and then don't even accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like, the rules say one thing, but the way things are actually done is totally different. It's all so stuck in the past, and they just cling to it even though it seems kinda outdated.  \n\nNow, I think letting priests get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from, you know, doing the bad stuff. It's a whole 'nother level, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they probably gonna hurt kids regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about something messed up inside them, not about being single.  So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop that from happening.\n\nNope.",
            "Ugh, man, this whole thing is a real head-scratcher. I'm not sure where I stand on it yet, you know? It's tough to say if either side is totally right or wrong. This feels like the biggest, most tangled mess we're dealing with right now. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage even means.  It's a real minefield, trying to talk about this without stepping on anyone's toes.\n\nI dunno, maybe... maybe all civil unions are the way to go.  Should the government even be in charge of defining marriage, anyway?  It's like a sacrament, right? People don't get special tax breaks or anything from the government just for being baptized. So, if you're married, maybe the government should just see it as a civil union - two people, that's all it is. No need to get into the whole church and state thing, just recognize that two people are together.\n\nAnd with gay marriage...  I mean, it's just like any other civil union, right? Two people, love, commitment. If all the states could agree on that, maybe it should just become federal law.\n\nBut trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's insane! The Constitution shouldn't be messed with just because some people feel strongly about something. It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but not big enough to change the foundation of our country. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nNope, not worth it.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I've got tons of gay friends, you know? It's not something I totally agree with, but I believe everyone should have the right to marry who they love. It shouldn't be a national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves.\n\n  Like, you've got your blue states and your red states, right?  Blue states tend to be more open to gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, well, that's how they feel about it. It's their call. You kinda knew what you were getting into when you moved there.\n\n It's all about equal opportunity for everyone. Homosexuals deserve the same chances as anyone else, so legalizing it on a state-by-state basis seems fair.\n\n Honestly, I don't think the president should have the power to ban gay marriage across the whole country. It's up to the states to decide what's best for their own people. \n\nLook, Bush is leaving office soon anyway. What happens then? If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth forever. Let each state figure it out for themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, like, Myspace is a public thing, right? It's like a bulletin board where everyone can see what you post. If you put something on there, you gotta know that people will see it - teachers, parents, even the principal.\n\nSo, if the school sees something on Myspace that worries them, like talk about a potential shooting, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could easily find it from home. \n\nI get that it's creepy for them to snoop, especially if they're just looking for reasons to punish kids for drinking or smoking. But if they're trying to prevent something really bad, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay. Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, right?\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't write something bad about someone in an email if you didn't want them to see it, right? Because once something is online, it's out there forever.  \n\nIt's scary to think that something you post online could come back to bite you later, like when you're an adult. People can find old stuff from your Myspace days, even if you thought you deleted it. \n\nSo, yeah, I think it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, it's a invasion of privacy. On the other hand, they're trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Alright, so, the war... man.  At first, I was all in, you know?  Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I wanted payback.  I was ready to cause some serious chaos, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were fueled by emotion.  We didn't really think things through, went in unprepared, without a plan.  And it blew up in our faces.  I mean, I was for it then, but now?  I'm completely against it.\n\nI don't think it accomplished anything.  Those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  If they can't even get along, how are we supposed to help?  Frankly, Nine Eleven kinda made me lose all care about what happens over there.\n\nThey're just... different, you know?  They fight like savages, and I don't think they're really aiming to improve their country. They just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's best.  We should just pack up and leave.  We were just hyped up, driven by revenge.  Bush felt the pressure, the people wanted action.  And yeah, I get it, declaring war on Iraq seemed like the only option after what happened.\n\nBut we needed a better plan.  We didn't know what we were facing, and war over there is different.  We lacked unity, no clear goals, and it just spiraled out of control.  We went in driven by anger, and that's what we created over there.  I don't think we're capable of changing them. They're always going to be like that.\n\nI've said enough.  It's gone on long enough.  Sure, we've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just collapse once we leave, and we can't stay forever.  We're hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so I think the Catholic Church needs to evolve a bit, you know? Like, I hear they're losing followers, and I think it might be because some of their views are, well, a little stuck in the past.  \n\nTake gay marriage, abortion, birth control – these are hot button issues, and the Church's stance on them is pretty strong.  Now, they have the right to their beliefs, but maybe if they opened their minds a little, they wouldn't be losing so many people.  \n\nI hear folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with how they handle these things.  It's like, if the Church says abortion is wrong and you believe it's okay, you might not feel comfortable being part of that group. Same with gay marriage – if that's something you support, you might not want to belong to a place that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married.  It's not like those things would magically solve all their problems, but maybe it would help.  Like, maybe if priests had families, they wouldn't be so quick to, you know, *do those things*.  I mean, it's hard to say for sure, right?",
            "So, like, gay marriage, huh? Well, I ain't sayin' it's wrong, you know? I dunno, maybe it's somethin' you're just born with, like, not a choice, ya dig? Like, I was born straight, and some folks are born gay, right?  Seems kinda unfair to hold 'em responsible for somethin' they weren't choosin',  y'know?\n\nIt just seems messed up to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two ladies can't.  Haven't really thought too hard about it, but it feels wrong,  ya know?\n\nIt's like, they don't get to pick who they're attracted to,  it's just how they are.  I mean, shouldn't we be cool with that? Shouldn't the government stay outta people's love lives?  It ain't like it's threatenin' national security or nothin'. Seems kinda private, y'know?\n\nIt's like, why put 'em on a stage and make 'em feel bad for  who they are? Like they made a wrong choice or somethin'.  Nah, man, that ain't right.  Let 'em live their lives,  love who they love,  it's not hurtin' nobody.",
            "So, I'm all for gay marriage, ya know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are gonna mess up straight families, but come on! It's just not the same thing.  It's like two sides of the same coin – different, but still connected.  \n\nThere's a whole bunch of rights that come with marriage, like property and healthcare. Think about it, if your partner's gay, they can't even visit you in the hospital! It's crazy, right? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and healthy as straight ones.  They've got the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat bugs me is that folks get hung up on the religious angle.  Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church – they just want a legal document, something the government issues.  If the government isn't involved in religion, why should it matter?\n\nIt's like segregation – separating people based on who they are isn't fair. Gay couples are just like straight couples – they have the same roles, the same dynamics.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and kids. Will they be okay? But the truth is, parenting skills are the same, whether you're gay or straight.  It's about love and care, not orientation.  Plus, some kids of gay parents face bullying in schools. It's heartbreaking, and it shouldn't be happening.\n\nLook, I think the government needs to step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about equality and treating everyone fairly.  President Bush seems to have strong religious views that get in the way, but morality is subjective! It's not something the government should be dictating.  \n\nSome folks think being gay is a psychological problem, but the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. We need to listen to experts and evidence, not just rumors and prejudice.",
            "Alright, so listen up, I work in a hospital pharmacy, you know?  See, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's all bad. Like,  I think making drugs available to everyone is a big no-no, but for medical uses?  Totally a yes. Cause come on, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good uses, right? It's not like it's inherently bad.  \n\nI mean, think about it,  we pharmacies use all kinds of crazy drugs that are totally illegal, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, all that jazz. They're controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why not give marijuana the same chance, ya know? \n\nPeople get all hung up on it being taboo, but it ain't like alcohol. Sure, alcohol can be bad too, but weed, if you mess with it too much, it's not gonna kill ya like some hard stuff. It's a tricky thing, I guess. Maybe we should legalize it little by little, not all at once, so folks don't go crazy. But first, we gotta ditch that whole scary \"Reefer Madness\" vibe, ya know? \n\nPeople freak out about marijuana 'cause it's illegal, but honestly, it ain't as bad as heroin or cocaine.  If we stop picturing it as this evil drug, maybe people will use it responsibly. And for medical stuff?  Definitely.",
            "So, I think the church has totally changed with the times, you know? It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was a kid, every Sunday was a big deal - cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too. We'd go to church every week, but now things are different. \n\nThey've got this teen mass thing, which is only like thirty minutes long. People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. I've seen people show up straight from the beach! And even at the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, people are rocking jeans and khakis now.  \n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. As for all the other stuff, like the scandals with priests, well, I don't really know about all that political stuff. But yeah, the church seems a lot more laid-back these days.",
            "(laughs)\n\nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, the whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil. At first, I was kinda okay with the idea, but then 9/11 happened, and everything changed. It felt like we rushed into this war, using 9/11 as a smokescreen.\n\nThey kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but that's all been proven false. The Bush administration straight up lied to us, and they haven't even admitted it! It's like they don't even care about the Constitution.\n\nI mean, even Colin Powell, remember that big speech he gave at the UN? Now he says he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong. That's a crime, plain and simple.\n\nIt feels like they came into office wanting to go to war, and they twisted everything to make it happen. I heard this one guy, a former Treasury Secretary, said they were practically itching for a fight. And don't even get me started on the whole oil thing – using a war to control resources? So shady.\n\nIt's been going on for way too long. Pulling out now would be messy, though, probably cause a civil war and more deaths. But sending in Syria and Saudi Arabia to \"fix\" things? That doesn't feel right either. It's like they're just going to keep meddling in Iraq's affairs, and that's not good for anyone.\n\nAnd the Iraqi government? What a mess! Parliament's useless, the Prime Minister has no real power, and these radical groups are running wild. It's like a powder keg waiting to explode.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq?  Man, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, you know?  I mean, it wasn't even a real war, officially. It just felt like a \"get back at Iraq\" thing, like they were the ones behind 9/11. \n\nHonestly, I'm not really into politics or keeping up with all the details. But it seems like we're still there trying to build a democracy, like we want Iraq to become another USA. And, let's be real, oil is a big part of it too. \n\nThe thing is, it's making everyone mad.  We can't just force democracy on them overnight. It takes time, and if we leave before it's set, they'll be even more messed up.  It's a real catch-22.\n\nSee, I'm not good with tough topics like this. It's so complicated! \n\nBut I guess I feel like we should stay, help them out, but it's a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, kind of like how Vietnam is still seen as a bad thing.\n\nOn the other hand, I know there are families with loved ones in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. \n\nIt's a mess! They have their own culture, and we're trying to force ours on them. It just feels like it's making things worse, stirring up more hatred.\n\nI think this war will drag on forever, and nobody wins in the end. It's a real bummer.",
            "Ugh, I just can't see how legalizing it is right. It feels wrong, like the government overstepping its bounds. The Constitution, man, it's crystal clear about separating church and state. They're trying to force their beliefs on everyone, picking and choosing which churches get to decide what's right and wrong. It's like saying Catholics get to rule the roost on this one, even though most of them are against it.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is what makes this country great, you know? It lets everyone practice their faith freely.  Trying to change that with an amendment feels like going against everything the Constitution stands for. Plus, wouldn't it be the first amendment ever meant to restrict people instead of the government?  \n\nThis whole thing just feels off. The government shouldn't be telling churches what they can and can't do. It should be up to them, not some politician pushing his own beliefs, especially when they go against the grain of what the Constitution already says.  \n\nI just don't see how it impacts the economy or anything else. Maybe even a positive vibe, who knows? It's all about personal choice, not government interference.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  Let me tell ya, I don't think the government straight up told the American people the whole truth about why we went in there. They tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, but honestly, those two things weren't really connected. The government played on people's emotions, you know? They were angry after 9/11, and they used that anger to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam – another mistake the government should've learned from.  Tons of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and just ripped out Iraq's government without a solid plan for what would happen next. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt. Now we're stuck there trying to put in a democracy, which is a tough job, even in a country that's ready for it.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – trying to push out communism and force democracy on a people who weren't ready for it. It wasn't a clear victory, more like a long, painful loss. You can't just win hearts and minds by force.  Even if some people support you, there are always going to be insurgents fighting back. It's impossible to fight a whole nation.\n\nThe government should've known this going in.  They should've planned for all the possibilities.  They made it seem like this would be a quick, clean win, but it's been dragging on forever.  We're still there in 2006, American troops are still dying, and the Iraqi government is still struggling to hold together.\n\nIt's a tough situation.  I mean, we can't just leave them now after all the chaos we've unleashed. But how long can we keep putting our own people at risk for a country that might never be truly free?\n\nAnd then there's the whole oil thing. Are we really fighting this war for democracy, or are we fighting for access to their resources? We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, and we didn't do anything about it. It's all about money and control, isn't it?",
            "So, you know, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I really think it's a personal preference, something that science is showing is more likely biological than anything else.  To take away someone's rights because of something they can't control, something that's part of who they are, feels just plain wrong to me. It's like, inhuman, you know? I've always been a supporter of gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. This is a personal thing, a family thing. It's not something the state should be dictating. At home, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of gay couples who are together, but can't get married because the law won't let them. They live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go to work, they're part of the community. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. It's people's lives, their love, their commitment.  \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how studies are showing that there's a biological basis for being gay, something that's in your brain chemistry. It's like you're born that way, not something you choose. It's not about how you were raised or your environment. \n\nBesides the obvious,  it just feels… yeah, like it's a private matter. A guy and a girl can marry without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to get married, it's a huge deal. It's like they're making a public spectacle out of it when it should just be a personal celebration.  It should be kept in the private realm, not splashed all over the news.",
            "Alright, listen up. When you chuck something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. It's public, plain and simple. \n\nBeing an RA, I've seen this firsthand.  Whatever you put online, it sticks. People will judge you based on it. If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shooting things, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss these things out there. The internet's a wild beast; everyone's got a peek. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, you get their updates.\n\nNow, the school probably didn't get an official warning from Myspace. Someone saw something, got worried, and told the school. They had to act, you know?  Imagine if something bad happened, and they could have stopped it?  \n\nBut, here's the catch - sometimes people mess around, right? They joke around, and it can get misinterpreted. Like, maybe it was just a crazed sociology project gone wrong. Or maybe, just maybe, it was something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone heard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked through the kid's Facebook, and found some stuff that, in light of the situation, was pretty darn scary. It might have been a joke, but it looked bad.\n\nThe thing is, once you put something online, there's no privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it! Don't expect to control what people think.\n\nNow, I'm not saying school officials should be stalking their students on Facebook. That's creepy! But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously. \n\nI mean, I don't think they should be snooping through texts or IMs unless they have a good reason. But if something's brought up, they have to investigate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.",
            "Right, so I feel like this whole war has dragged on for far too long.  At the start, I get it, there was a good reason, right?  Helping another country get its democracy going.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just in it because we have to be, like we're trying to prove we're the big dogs.  Plus, the whole thing started because of, you know, whatever issues Bush Sr. had with Saddam back in the day. So maybe the reasons we started this weren't so pure to begin with.\n\nIf the goal was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have one, that's a good thing, a righteous thing. But I don't think that's what's happening anymore. It's like we've lost our way, and now it's all about winning, about not backing down, even though it's been going on for years.\n\nListen, maybe in those first few months, dropping that bombshell made a statement, but come on, it's been way too long.  Their government, their people, they have to figure things out on their own eventually. We can't keep throwing money and lives into this thing forever.\n\nThink about it: we're spending billions and billions, money that could be helping people here at home.  We have our own problems, poverty, things we need to fix, but instead, we're pouring it all into this war that doesn't even have a clear purpose anymore.\n\nWe need to stop. We need to bring our troops home. There comes a point where you just have to say enough is enough. We can't keep bleeding money and lives for a war we've already lost.",
            "So, lemme ask,  you know, there was this thing, right?  Seems like someone saw somethin' online, like on Myspace, and it, like, stopped some bad stuff from happening. I get that it's kind of a bummer, ya know, people lookin' at your stuff without permission. But isn't Myspace kinda public, like, if you put it out there, it's kinda fair game?\n\nI mean, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you chose to be their friend, right?  So it's kinda like givin' them the okay to see that stuff.\n\nIt's like, anything you put online, you gotta expect that some folks might see it.\n\nI guess if someone saw somethin' that could've saved someone's life, that's a good thing, right?\n\nBut,  uh, it's tough, right?  I mean, you can't have someone watchin' everyone's Myspace all day, lookin' for trouble.\n\nThat'd be like, pickin' on the \"bad kids\" or somethin'.\n\nI don't know, maybe it depends on the situation.\n\nLike, were they lookin' for somethin' specific, or just snoopin'?\n\nI don't know, it's a sticky wicket.\n\nMe, I don't have Myspace, but I got Facebook.\n\nIt freaks me out a little thinkin' about creeps out there seein' my stuff.\n\nI saw this thing on TV once, about this dude who could find people's info real fast, like, got their screen name and started talkin' to 'em on IM in like, less than a minute, and got 'em to meet up.\n\nI wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes IM'in me, and they know it's me, even though I don't recognize their names.\n\nIt's creepy, 'cause they know all about you, your classes, your friends, your photos. \n\nI try to keep it clean, but it's hard, 'cause Facebook is supposed to be for connectin' with friends.\n\nSo, it's a double-edged sword, ya know?\n\nYou put stuff out there, you gotta expect some folks might see it.\n\n I heard my roommate talkin' about her high school, they banned Myspace.\n\nThat's kinda weird, right? How can they tell you what you can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing makes me want to pull my hair out.  It feels hypocritical even talking about it, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start.  I mean, I was, but honestly, does it even matter now?  It's like everyone knows it was a bad idea except for those in charge who just can't admit they messed up. \n\nYou look at the polls, it's insane.  Everywhere you look, seventy-five to eighty percent of people think it was a disaster – Iraqis, Americans, even the troops over there.  They want out!  And who can blame them?  It's been a train wreck from day one, and pulling out is just gonna be another dumpster fire.  The Middle East is a tangled mess, and our culture just clashes so badly with theirs.  It's like these politicians think they can just force democracy on them, but it's not that simple.  It's their culture, their way of life, and it's not like they asked for our help.\n\nSure, Saddam was a jerk, no question.  But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country, and this was just a recipe for disaster.  It's like quicksand, the deeper we get, the harder it is to get out.  \n\nHonestly, I don't even know what to say anymore.  I can't see any reason to stay there, and I haven't heard a single good reason from the administration.  Maybe a slow pullout over a year or so wouldn't be so bad, but just leaving now?  I think the people of Iraq deserve a say in this, and if they want us gone, maybe we should listen.  At least then we can wash our hands of it and say, \"We gave you the chance, but you chose to go your own way.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do.  But at least this way we'd be less of a problem.",
            "Ya know what? I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women. It's more like, depending on the field you're in, you know? Like for women, there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  \n\nMen sometimes have a hard time taking orders from a woman, just because of how things have always been. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't promote her because, well, history tells them women aren't supposed to be in charge. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other areas. Think about stay-at-home dads. It's super rare for a guy to be the one at home with the kids. People often judge them, thinking, \"Shouldn't the man be out earning money?\"  It can be tough on them when their dream is to raise their kids and their wife has the better job, even if it all works out great for their family. Society just doesn't get it. \n\nAnd in fashion? Guys can get overlooked if they're straight. Not sure if that makes sense, but people might think, \"How can a guy *really* understand fashion if he's not a woman?\" It's like, \"Oh, you're not like the other guys, so you must not know what you're talking about.\"\n\nSo yeah, depending on what you do, there's definitely gender discrimination.  Changing it is slow, though. We've come a long way from the 1800s for sure, but people have set ways of thinking.  Slowly, women are climbing the corporate ladder, becoming CEOs, and being accepted in business.  More men are becoming stay-at-home dads, and people are starting to see that it can work.  \n\nI think it's all about showing the good qualities of those who are stereotyped.  If you push too hard, people resist. We're finding a balance, but change takes time.",
            "So, get this, they didn't exactly legalize it, more like took the handcuffs off, y'know? Demystified it, turned it from a full-blown criminal offense to, like, a parking ticket.  You get a slap on the wrist instead of being thrown in the slammer. But here's the kicker, man, even with this decriminalization thing, the fear of a drug charge still lingers. Job interviews, background checks, all that jazz. It's a shadow that follows you, even if you're not facing jail time.  \n\nIt's crazy, right?  Think about it, the system spends a fortune locking people up for weed.  Courts, lawyers, housing, the whole nine yards. Where's that money going? Could it be going towards, you know, helping people instead of punishing them?  \n\nSeems like cities struggling financially could really use that cash. But then again, some places are just dead set against marijuana, no matter what. It's like a principle thing.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, I think it's a win-win. More money for schools, social programs, helping those in need.  It's a step in the right direction. \n\nBut let's be real, we don't want weed everywhere, blowing up like cigarettes in gas stations. There are valid concerns about that. It's still a bit taboo in many circles. Imagine the awkwardness, right? \n\nAnd alcohol, that's a different beast.  It messes with your motor skills more directly.  But marijuana, it can mess with your life in other ways, your choices, your priorities.  \n\nIt's a double-edged sword, man.  It affects everyone differently. Some people are responsible, some go overboard. It's hard to say for sure what the right answer is.",
            "I reckon I'd say yes, mostly because a lot of their traditions are pretty solid, like they've been doing the same stuff for ages. That's cool, you know, having roots. But it's also gotta be alright to change with the times, right? \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know feel this pressure to go to church every week, and there's a real strictness around how things are done. It's like they judge folks who don't follow every single rule perfectly. They don't seem too keen on folks who aren't, like, totally Catholic either, you know? And they don't really roll out the welcome mat for people from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Talk about not being open-minded, right?  We were always taught to love everyone, which is a big Catholic thing. But it feels kinda bogus when they preach that and then don't even accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like, the rules say one thing, but the way things are actually done is totally different. It's all so stuck in the past, and they just cling to it even though it seems kinda outdated.  \n\nNow, I think letting priests get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from, you know, doing the bad stuff. It's a whole 'nother level, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they probably gonna hurt kids regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about something messed up inside them, not about being single.  So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop that from happening.\n\nNope.",
            "Ugh, man, this whole thing is a real head-scratcher. I'm not sure where I stand on it yet, you know? It's tough to say if either side is totally right or wrong. This feels like the biggest, most tangled mess we're dealing with right now. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage even means.  It's a real minefield, trying to talk about this without stepping on anyone's toes.\n\nI dunno, maybe... maybe all civil unions are the way to go.  Should the government even be in charge of defining marriage, anyway?  It's like a sacrament, right? People don't get special tax breaks or anything from the government just for being baptized. So, if you're married, maybe the government should just see it as a civil union - two people, that's all it is. No need to get into the whole church and state thing, just recognize that two people are together.\n\nAnd with gay marriage...  I mean, it's just like any other civil union, right? Two people, love, commitment. If all the states could agree on that, maybe it should just become federal law.\n\nBut trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's insane! The Constitution shouldn't be messed with just because some people feel strongly about something. It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but not big enough to change the foundation of our country. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nNope, not worth it.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I've got tons of gay friends, you know? It's not something I totally agree with, but I believe everyone should have the right to marry who they love. It shouldn't be a national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves.\n\n  Like, you've got your blue states and your red states, right?  Blue states tend to be more open to gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, well, that's how they feel about it. It's their call. You kinda knew what you were getting into when you moved there.\n\n It's all about equal opportunity for everyone. Homosexuals deserve the same chances as anyone else, so legalizing it on a state-by-state basis seems fair.\n\n Honestly, I don't think the president should have the power to ban gay marriage across the whole country. It's up to the states to decide what's best for their own people. \n\nLook, Bush is leaving office soon anyway. What happens then? If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth forever. Let each state figure it out for themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, like, Myspace is a public thing, right? It's like a bulletin board where everyone can see what you post. If you put something on there, you gotta know that people will see it - teachers, parents, even the principal.\n\nSo, if the school sees something on Myspace that worries them, like talk about a potential shooting, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could easily find it from home. \n\nI get that it's creepy for them to snoop, especially if they're just looking for reasons to punish kids for drinking or smoking. But if they're trying to prevent something really bad, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay. Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, right?\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't write something bad about someone in an email if you didn't want them to see it, right? Because once something is online, it's out there forever.  \n\nIt's scary to think that something you post online could come back to bite you later, like when you're an adult. People can find old stuff from your Myspace days, even if you thought you deleted it. \n\nSo, yeah, I think it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, it's a invasion of privacy. On the other hand, they're trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Alright, so, the war... man.  At first, I was all in, you know?  Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I wanted payback.  I was ready to cause some serious chaos, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were fueled by emotion.  We didn't really think things through, went in unprepared, without a plan.  And it blew up in our faces.  I mean, I was for it then, but now?  I'm completely against it.\n\nI don't think it accomplished anything.  Those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  If they can't even get along, how are we supposed to help?  Frankly, Nine Eleven kinda made me lose all care about what happens over there.\n\nThey're just... different, you know?  They fight like savages, and I don't think they're really aiming to improve their country. They just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's best.  We should just pack up and leave.  We were just hyped up, driven by revenge.  Bush felt the pressure, the people wanted action.  And yeah, I get it, declaring war on Iraq seemed like the only option after what happened.\n\nBut we needed a better plan.  We didn't know what we were facing, and war over there is different.  We lacked unity, no clear goals, and it just spiraled out of control.  We went in driven by anger, and that's what we created over there.  I don't think we're capable of changing them. They're always going to be like that.\n\nI've said enough.  It's gone on long enough.  Sure, we've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just collapse once we leave, and we can't stay forever.  We're hurting ourselves by staying."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so I think the Catholic Church needs to evolve a bit, you know? Like, I hear they're losing followers, and I think it might be because some of their views are, well, a little stuck in the past.  \n\nTake gay marriage, abortion, birth control – these are hot button issues, and the Church's stance on them is pretty strong.  Now, they have the right to their beliefs, but maybe if they opened their minds a little, they wouldn't be losing so many people.  \n\nI hear folks are starting to turn away from the Church because they disagree with how they handle these things.  It's like, if the Church says abortion is wrong and you believe it's okay, you might not feel comfortable being part of that group. Same with gay marriage – if that's something you support, you might not want to belong to a place that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or allow priests to get married.  It's not like those things would magically solve all their problems, but maybe it would help.  Like, maybe if priests had families, they wouldn't be so quick to, you know, *do those things*.  I mean, it's hard to say for sure, right?",
            "So, like, gay marriage, huh? Well, I ain't sayin' it's wrong, you know? I dunno, maybe it's somethin' you're just born with, like, not a choice, ya dig? Like, I was born straight, and some folks are born gay, right?  Seems kinda unfair to hold 'em responsible for somethin' they weren't choosin',  y'know?\n\nIt just seems messed up to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two ladies can't.  Haven't really thought too hard about it, but it feels wrong,  ya know?\n\nIt's like, they don't get to pick who they're attracted to,  it's just how they are.  I mean, shouldn't we be cool with that? Shouldn't the government stay outta people's love lives?  It ain't like it's threatenin' national security or nothin'. Seems kinda private, y'know?\n\nIt's like, why put 'em on a stage and make 'em feel bad for  who they are? Like they made a wrong choice or somethin'.  Nah, man, that ain't right.  Let 'em live their lives,  love who they love,  it's not hurtin' nobody.",
            "So, I'm all for gay marriage, ya know? There's really no good reason against it. Some folks think gay couples are gonna mess up straight families, but come on! It's just not the same thing.  It's like two sides of the same coin – different, but still connected.  \n\nThere's a whole bunch of rights that come with marriage, like property and healthcare. Think about it, if your partner's gay, they can't even visit you in the hospital! It's crazy, right? If you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they have those rights? \n\nLots of studies show that gay relationships are just as strong and healthy as straight ones.  They've got the same ingredients for a happy relationship. It's just love, plain and simple.  \n\nWhat bugs me is that folks get hung up on the religious angle.  Gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church – they just want a legal document, something the government issues.  If the government isn't involved in religion, why should it matter?\n\nIt's like segregation – separating people based on who they are isn't fair. Gay couples are just like straight couples – they have the same roles, the same dynamics.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and kids. Will they be okay? But the truth is, parenting skills are the same, whether you're gay or straight.  It's about love and care, not orientation.  Plus, some kids of gay parents face bullying in schools. It's heartbreaking, and it shouldn't be happening.\n\nLook, I think the government needs to step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  It's about equality and treating everyone fairly.  President Bush seems to have strong religious views that get in the way, but morality is subjective! It's not something the government should be dictating.  \n\nSome folks think being gay is a psychological problem, but the American Psychological Association says that's just not true. We need to listen to experts and evidence, not just rumors and prejudice.",
            "Alright, so listen up, I work in a hospital pharmacy, you know?  See, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it's all bad. Like,  I think making drugs available to everyone is a big no-no, but for medical uses?  Totally a yes. Cause come on, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good uses, right? It's not like it's inherently bad.  \n\nI mean, think about it,  we pharmacies use all kinds of crazy drugs that are totally illegal, like OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, all that jazz. They're controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why not give marijuana the same chance, ya know? \n\nPeople get all hung up on it being taboo, but it ain't like alcohol. Sure, alcohol can be bad too, but weed, if you mess with it too much, it's not gonna kill ya like some hard stuff. It's a tricky thing, I guess. Maybe we should legalize it little by little, not all at once, so folks don't go crazy. But first, we gotta ditch that whole scary \"Reefer Madness\" vibe, ya know? \n\nPeople freak out about marijuana 'cause it's illegal, but honestly, it ain't as bad as heroin or cocaine.  If we stop picturing it as this evil drug, maybe people will use it responsibly. And for medical stuff?  Definitely.",
            "So, I think the church has totally changed with the times, you know? It's not as strict as it used to be. When I was a kid, every Sunday was a big deal - cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards. I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too. We'd go to church every week, but now things are different. \n\nThey've got this teen mass thing, which is only like thirty minutes long. People dress way more casual, especially in the summer. I've seen people show up straight from the beach! And even at the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, people are rocking jeans and khakis now.  \n\nHonestly, that's the biggest change I've noticed. As for all the other stuff, like the scandals with priests, well, I don't really know about all that political stuff. But yeah, the church seems a lot more laid-back these days.",
            "(laughs)\n\nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, the whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil. At first, I was kinda okay with the idea, but then 9/11 happened, and everything changed. It felt like we rushed into this war, using 9/11 as a smokescreen.\n\nThey kept saying Saddam Hussein was connected to Bin Laden and had weapons of mass destruction, but that's all been proven false. The Bush administration straight up lied to us, and they haven't even admitted it! It's like they don't even care about the Constitution.\n\nI mean, even Colin Powell, remember that big speech he gave at the UN? Now he says he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then! That's just wrong. That's a crime, plain and simple.\n\nIt feels like they came into office wanting to go to war, and they twisted everything to make it happen. I heard this one guy, a former Treasury Secretary, said they were practically itching for a fight. And don't even get me started on the whole oil thing – using a war to control resources? So shady.\n\nIt's been going on for way too long. Pulling out now would be messy, though, probably cause a civil war and more deaths. But sending in Syria and Saudi Arabia to \"fix\" things? That doesn't feel right either. It's like they're just going to keep meddling in Iraq's affairs, and that's not good for anyone.\n\nAnd the Iraqi government? What a mess! Parliament's useless, the Prime Minister has no real power, and these radical groups are running wild. It's like a powder keg waiting to explode.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq?  Man, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, you know?  I mean, it wasn't even a real war, officially. It just felt like a \"get back at Iraq\" thing, like they were the ones behind 9/11. \n\nHonestly, I'm not really into politics or keeping up with all the details. But it seems like we're still there trying to build a democracy, like we want Iraq to become another USA. And, let's be real, oil is a big part of it too. \n\nThe thing is, it's making everyone mad.  We can't just force democracy on them overnight. It takes time, and if we leave before it's set, they'll be even more messed up.  It's a real catch-22.\n\nSee, I'm not good with tough topics like this. It's so complicated! \n\nBut I guess I feel like we should stay, help them out, but it's a waste of resources. It's making Bush look bad, kind of like how Vietnam is still seen as a bad thing.\n\nOn the other hand, I know there are families with loved ones in Iraq, and I don't want to see them hurt. \n\nIt's a mess! They have their own culture, and we're trying to force ours on them. It just feels like it's making things worse, stirring up more hatred.\n\nI think this war will drag on forever, and nobody wins in the end. It's a real bummer.",
            "Ugh, I just can't see how legalizing it is right. It feels wrong, like the government overstepping its bounds. The Constitution, man, it's crystal clear about separating church and state. They're trying to force their beliefs on everyone, picking and choosing which churches get to decide what's right and wrong. It's like saying Catholics get to rule the roost on this one, even though most of them are against it.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is what makes this country great, you know? It lets everyone practice their faith freely.  Trying to change that with an amendment feels like going against everything the Constitution stands for. Plus, wouldn't it be the first amendment ever meant to restrict people instead of the government?  \n\nThis whole thing just feels off. The government shouldn't be telling churches what they can and can't do. It should be up to them, not some politician pushing his own beliefs, especially when they go against the grain of what the Constitution already says.  \n\nI just don't see how it impacts the economy or anything else. Maybe even a positive vibe, who knows? It's all about personal choice, not government interference.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq...  Let me tell ya, I don't think the government straight up told the American people the whole truth about why we went in there. They tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, but honestly, those two things weren't really connected. The government played on people's emotions, you know? They were angry after 9/11, and they used that anger to push for the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike.  This whole Iraq thing feels a lot like Vietnam – another mistake the government should've learned from.  Tons of American soldiers have died, and it's heartbreaking.\n\nThey went in and just ripped out Iraq's government without a solid plan for what would happen next. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the chaos that would erupt. Now we're stuck there trying to put in a democracy, which is a tough job, even in a country that's ready for it.\n\nIt's like what happened in Vietnam – trying to push out communism and force democracy on a people who weren't ready for it. It wasn't a clear victory, more like a long, painful loss. You can't just win hearts and minds by force.  Even if some people support you, there are always going to be insurgents fighting back. It's impossible to fight a whole nation.\n\nThe government should've known this going in.  They should've planned for all the possibilities.  They made it seem like this would be a quick, clean win, but it's been dragging on forever.  We're still there in 2006, American troops are still dying, and the Iraqi government is still struggling to hold together.\n\nIt's a tough situation.  I mean, we can't just leave them now after all the chaos we've unleashed. But how long can we keep putting our own people at risk for a country that might never be truly free?\n\nAnd then there's the whole oil thing. Are we really fighting this war for democracy, or are we fighting for access to their resources? We knew North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, and we didn't do anything about it. It's all about money and control, isn't it?",
            "So, you know, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  I really think it's a personal preference, something that science is showing is more likely biological than anything else.  To take away someone's rights because of something they can't control, something that's part of who they are, feels just plain wrong to me. It's like, inhuman, you know? I've always been a supporter of gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics or the government should have anything to do with it. This is a personal thing, a family thing. It's not something the state should be dictating. At home, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of gay couples who are together, but can't get married because the law won't let them. They live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they go to work, they're part of the community. \n\nIt just seems ridiculous to me that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. It's people's lives, their love, their commitment.  \n\nI've read and heard a lot about how studies are showing that there's a biological basis for being gay, something that's in your brain chemistry. It's like you're born that way, not something you choose. It's not about how you were raised or your environment. \n\nBesides the obvious,  it just feels… yeah, like it's a private matter. A guy and a girl can marry without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to get married, it's a huge deal. It's like they're making a public spectacle out of it when it should just be a personal celebration.  It should be kept in the private realm, not splashed all over the news.",
            "Alright, listen up. When you chuck something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. It's public, plain and simple. \n\nBeing an RA, I've seen this firsthand.  Whatever you put online, it sticks. People will judge you based on it. If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shooting things, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss these things out there. The internet's a wild beast; everyone's got a peek. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, you get their updates.\n\nNow, the school probably didn't get an official warning from Myspace. Someone saw something, got worried, and told the school. They had to act, you know?  Imagine if something bad happened, and they could have stopped it?  \n\nBut, here's the catch - sometimes people mess around, right? They joke around, and it can get misinterpreted. Like, maybe it was just a crazed sociology project gone wrong. Or maybe, just maybe, it was something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone heard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated. They looked through the kid's Facebook, and found some stuff that, in light of the situation, was pretty darn scary. It might have been a joke, but it looked bad.\n\nThe thing is, once you put something online, there's no privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it! Don't expect to control what people think.\n\nNow, I'm not saying school officials should be stalking their students on Facebook. That's creepy! But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously. \n\nI mean, I don't think they should be snooping through texts or IMs unless they have a good reason. But if something's brought up, they have to investigate.\n\nIt's a tricky situation.",
            "Right, so I feel like this whole war has dragged on for far too long.  At the start, I get it, there was a good reason, right?  Helping another country get its democracy going.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that. Now it feels like we're just in it because we have to be, like we're trying to prove we're the big dogs.  Plus, the whole thing started because of, you know, whatever issues Bush Sr. had with Saddam back in the day. So maybe the reasons we started this weren't so pure to begin with.\n\nIf the goal was to bring democracy to a country that didn't have one, that's a good thing, a righteous thing. But I don't think that's what's happening anymore. It's like we've lost our way, and now it's all about winning, about not backing down, even though it's been going on for years.\n\nListen, maybe in those first few months, dropping that bombshell made a statement, but come on, it's been way too long.  Their government, their people, they have to figure things out on their own eventually. We can't keep throwing money and lives into this thing forever.\n\nThink about it: we're spending billions and billions, money that could be helping people here at home.  We have our own problems, poverty, things we need to fix, but instead, we're pouring it all into this war that doesn't even have a clear purpose anymore.\n\nWe need to stop. We need to bring our troops home. There comes a point where you just have to say enough is enough. We can't keep bleeding money and lives for a war we've already lost.",
            "So, lemme ask,  you know, there was this thing, right?  Seems like someone saw somethin' online, like on Myspace, and it, like, stopped some bad stuff from happening. I get that it's kind of a bummer, ya know, people lookin' at your stuff without permission. But isn't Myspace kinda public, like, if you put it out there, it's kinda fair game?\n\nI mean, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you chose to be their friend, right?  So it's kinda like givin' them the okay to see that stuff.\n\nIt's like, anything you put online, you gotta expect that some folks might see it.\n\nI guess if someone saw somethin' that could've saved someone's life, that's a good thing, right?\n\nBut,  uh, it's tough, right?  I mean, you can't have someone watchin' everyone's Myspace all day, lookin' for trouble.\n\nThat'd be like, pickin' on the \"bad kids\" or somethin'.\n\nI don't know, maybe it depends on the situation.\n\nLike, were they lookin' for somethin' specific, or just snoopin'?\n\nI don't know, it's a sticky wicket.\n\nMe, I don't have Myspace, but I got Facebook.\n\nIt freaks me out a little thinkin' about creeps out there seein' my stuff.\n\nI saw this thing on TV once, about this dude who could find people's info real fast, like, got their screen name and started talkin' to 'em on IM in like, less than a minute, and got 'em to meet up.\n\nI wouldn't do that, but I've had people in my classes IM'in me, and they know it's me, even though I don't recognize their names.\n\nIt's creepy, 'cause they know all about you, your classes, your friends, your photos. \n\nI try to keep it clean, but it's hard, 'cause Facebook is supposed to be for connectin' with friends.\n\nSo, it's a double-edged sword, ya know?\n\nYou put stuff out there, you gotta expect some folks might see it.\n\n I heard my roommate talkin' about her high school, they banned Myspace.\n\nThat's kinda weird, right? How can they tell you what you can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing makes me want to pull my hair out.  It feels hypocritical even talking about it, you know?  I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start.  I mean, I was, but honestly, does it even matter now?  It's like everyone knows it was a bad idea except for those in charge who just can't admit they messed up. \n\nYou look at the polls, it's insane.  Everywhere you look, seventy-five to eighty percent of people think it was a disaster – Iraqis, Americans, even the troops over there.  They want out!  And who can blame them?  It's been a train wreck from day one, and pulling out is just gonna be another dumpster fire.  The Middle East is a tangled mess, and our culture just clashes so badly with theirs.  It's like these politicians think they can just force democracy on them, but it's not that simple.  It's their culture, their way of life, and it's not like they asked for our help.\n\nSure, Saddam was a jerk, no question.  But you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country, and this was just a recipe for disaster.  It's like quicksand, the deeper we get, the harder it is to get out.  \n\nHonestly, I don't even know what to say anymore.  I can't see any reason to stay there, and I haven't heard a single good reason from the administration.  Maybe a slow pullout over a year or so wouldn't be so bad, but just leaving now?  I think the people of Iraq deserve a say in this, and if they want us gone, maybe we should listen.  At least then we can wash our hands of it and say, \"We gave you the chance, but you chose to go your own way.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do.  But at least this way we'd be less of a problem.",
            "Ya know what? I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women. It's more like, depending on the field you're in, you know? Like for women, there's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing.  \n\nMen sometimes have a hard time taking orders from a woman, just because of how things have always been. So, a woman might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't promote her because, well, history tells them women aren't supposed to be in charge. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other areas. Think about stay-at-home dads. It's super rare for a guy to be the one at home with the kids. People often judge them, thinking, \"Shouldn't the man be out earning money?\"  It can be tough on them when their dream is to raise their kids and their wife has the better job, even if it all works out great for their family. Society just doesn't get it. \n\nAnd in fashion? Guys can get overlooked if they're straight. Not sure if that makes sense, but people might think, \"How can a guy *really* understand fashion if he's not a woman?\" It's like, \"Oh, you're not like the other guys, so you must not know what you're talking about.\"\n\nSo yeah, depending on what you do, there's definitely gender discrimination.  Changing it is slow, though. We've come a long way from the 1800s for sure, but people have set ways of thinking.  Slowly, women are climbing the corporate ladder, becoming CEOs, and being accepted in business.  More men are becoming stay-at-home dads, and people are starting to see that it can work.  \n\nI think it's all about showing the good qualities of those who are stereotyped.  If you push too hard, people resist. We're finding a balance, but change takes time.",
            "So, get this, they didn't exactly legalize it, more like took the handcuffs off, y'know? Demystified it, turned it from a full-blown criminal offense to, like, a parking ticket.  You get a slap on the wrist instead of being thrown in the slammer. But here's the kicker, man, even with this decriminalization thing, the fear of a drug charge still lingers. Job interviews, background checks, all that jazz. It's a shadow that follows you, even if you're not facing jail time.  \n\nIt's crazy, right?  Think about it, the system spends a fortune locking people up for weed.  Courts, lawyers, housing, the whole nine yards. Where's that money going? Could it be going towards, you know, helping people instead of punishing them?  \n\nSeems like cities struggling financially could really use that cash. But then again, some places are just dead set against marijuana, no matter what. It's like a principle thing.\n\nBut in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, I think it's a win-win. More money for schools, social programs, helping those in need.  It's a step in the right direction. \n\nBut let's be real, we don't want weed everywhere, blowing up like cigarettes in gas stations. There are valid concerns about that. It's still a bit taboo in many circles. Imagine the awkwardness, right? \n\nAnd alcohol, that's a different beast.  It messes with your motor skills more directly.  But marijuana, it can mess with your life in other ways, your choices, your priorities.  \n\nIt's a double-edged sword, man.  It affects everyone differently. Some people are responsible, some go overboard. It's hard to say for sure what the right answer is.",
            "I reckon I'd say yes, mostly because a lot of their traditions are pretty solid, like they've been doing the same stuff for ages. That's cool, you know, having roots. But it's also gotta be alright to change with the times, right? \n\nSee, a lot of Catholics I know feel this pressure to go to church every week, and there's a real strictness around how things are done. It's like they judge folks who don't follow every single rule perfectly. They don't seem too keen on folks who aren't, like, totally Catholic either, you know? And they don't really roll out the welcome mat for people from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't let them get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.  Talk about not being open-minded, right?  We were always taught to love everyone, which is a big Catholic thing. But it feels kinda bogus when they preach that and then don't even accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like, the rules say one thing, but the way things are actually done is totally different. It's all so stuck in the past, and they just cling to it even though it seems kinda outdated.  \n\nNow, I think letting priests get married would be a good thing, but it probably wouldn't stop them from, you know, doing the bad stuff. It's a whole 'nother level, you know?\n\nI mean, people who hurt kids, they probably gonna hurt kids regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about something messed up inside them, not about being single.  So, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop that from happening.\n\nNope.",
            "Ugh, man, this whole thing is a real head-scratcher. I'm not sure where I stand on it yet, you know? It's tough to say if either side is totally right or wrong. This feels like the biggest, most tangled mess we're dealing with right now. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage even means.  It's a real minefield, trying to talk about this without stepping on anyone's toes.\n\nI dunno, maybe... maybe all civil unions are the way to go.  Should the government even be in charge of defining marriage, anyway?  It's like a sacrament, right? People don't get special tax breaks or anything from the government just for being baptized. So, if you're married, maybe the government should just see it as a civil union - two people, that's all it is. No need to get into the whole church and state thing, just recognize that two people are together.\n\nAnd with gay marriage...  I mean, it's just like any other civil union, right? Two people, love, commitment. If all the states could agree on that, maybe it should just become federal law.\n\nBut trying to change the Constitution to ban gay marriage? That's insane! The Constitution shouldn't be messed with just because some people feel strongly about something. It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but not big enough to change the foundation of our country. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nNope, not worth it.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is a bit complicated for me.  I've got tons of gay friends, you know? It's not something I totally agree with, but I believe everyone should have the right to marry who they love. It shouldn't be a national debate, though. I think each state should decide for themselves.\n\n  Like, you've got your blue states and your red states, right?  Blue states tend to be more open to gay marriage, and if you live in one of those states, well, that's how they feel about it. It's their call. You kinda knew what you were getting into when you moved there.\n\n It's all about equal opportunity for everyone. Homosexuals deserve the same chances as anyone else, so legalizing it on a state-by-state basis seems fair.\n\n Honestly, I don't think the president should have the power to ban gay marriage across the whole country. It's up to the states to decide what's best for their own people. \n\nLook, Bush is leaving office soon anyway. What happens then? If a new president comes in and wants to change things, it'll just be back and forth forever. Let each state figure it out for themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Okay, so, like, Myspace is a public thing, right? It's like a bulletin board where everyone can see what you post. If you put something on there, you gotta know that people will see it - teachers, parents, even the principal.\n\nSo, if the school sees something on Myspace that worries them, like talk about a potential shooting, they have a right to see it. Even if they weren't looking under the school's name, they could easily find it from home. \n\nI get that it's creepy for them to snoop, especially if they're just looking for reasons to punish kids for drinking or smoking. But if they're trying to prevent something really bad, like a school shooting, then I think it's okay. Schools have a responsibility to keep students safe, right?\n\nIt's just like with emails. You wouldn't write something bad about someone in an email if you didn't want them to see it, right? Because once something is online, it's out there forever.  \n\nIt's scary to think that something you post online could come back to bite you later, like when you're an adult. People can find old stuff from your Myspace days, even if you thought you deleted it. \n\nSo, yeah, I think it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, it's a invasion of privacy. On the other hand, they're trying to keep everyone safe.",
            "Alright, so, the war... man.  At first, I was all in, you know?  Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I wanted payback.  I was ready to cause some serious chaos, just like they did here.  But looking back, I think we were fueled by emotion.  We didn't really think things through, went in unprepared, without a plan.  And it blew up in our faces.  I mean, I was for it then, but now?  I'm completely against it.\n\nI don't think it accomplished anything.  Those people over there, they're always fighting amongst themselves.  If they can't even get along, how are we supposed to help?  Frankly, Nine Eleven kinda made me lose all care about what happens over there.\n\nThey're just... different, you know?  They fight like savages, and I don't think they're really aiming to improve their country. They just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's best.  We should just pack up and leave.  We were just hyped up, driven by revenge.  Bush felt the pressure, the people wanted action.  And yeah, I get it, declaring war on Iraq seemed like the only option after what happened.\n\nBut we needed a better plan.  We didn't know what we were facing, and war over there is different.  We lacked unity, no clear goals, and it just spiraled out of control.  We went in driven by anger, and that's what we created over there.  I don't think we're capable of changing them. They're always going to be like that.\n\nI've said enough.  It's gone on long enough.  Sure, we've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying.  They'll just collapse once we leave, and we can't stay forever.  We're hurting ourselves by staying."
