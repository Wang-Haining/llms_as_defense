            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church could really use a bit of an update, ya know?  \n\nThey've been going on about how they're losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not super accepting of, well, a lot of stuff. Like, take gay marriage, abortion, birth control - those are biggies. They've got these super strong opinions about 'em, which is cool, but some of it feels a bit stuck in the past, ya know?  \n\nI've heard that a lot of people are starting to ditch the church 'cause they don't agree with their views on these things.  They just feel like the Church is on the wrong side of things. \n\nLike, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a church that says it's completely wrong.  Same deal with gay marriage, if that's something you support, you might not wanna be in a church that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or married priests.  But I'm not sure if that would've stopped all the bad stuff that's gone down. \n\nIt's tough to say, right? Maybe they would have done things differently if they could've gotten married or had women priests, but who knows? \n\nI just think it's weird that priests are supposed to be devoted to God but can't have regular lives with families like everyone else.  They're human too!",
            "Alright, so, like, gay marriage, huh? I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like a choice you make on purpose, right? So, gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are, you know? It's messed up to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but yeah, it seems wrong to me. Like, it's not a choice, you're just born that way. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, right? It's not something you pick, so you shouldn't be punished for it, if you get what I mean.\n\n(clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it's not really a legal thing, or even really a moral issue, you know? I mean, gay people shouldn't be put on trial or anything, like they made a wrong choice.\n\nIt's not the government's business, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nIt's tough to explain, but, like, it's not about security or morals or anything. It's just people's lives, and they should be able to live how they want. They shouldn't be punished for who they are. That's just how they were born, and that's okay.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage, you know?  It just seems like there's no good reason to say no.  People worry that it'll mess up traditional families, but honestly, it's like comparing apples and oranges.  They're different, but both relationships are, like, the same thing under the surface. It's just love, right?\n\nThere's a ton of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the hospital room with you if you're sick!  It's crazy because they're not considered family.  And who else would you want there if you're really sick?\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of research showing that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work. It's all about the connection, you know?\n\nWhat really gets me is that people think this is about churches getting involved. It's not! Gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document from the government.  The church and the state should be separate, right?\n\nAnd it's like, if you're okay with civil unions, why not just go all the way with marriage? It's the same thing, just with a different name.  It's like segregation, but for love.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how it will affect kids, but honestly, it's just about being a good parent.  Gay couples can be just as loving and caring as straight couples.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes kids get bullied or treated differently because their parents are gay. It's sad, but it happens.\n\nI think the government should definitely get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It shouldn't be up to each state to decide. \n\nThe whole thing makes me mad, especially when you hear people saying it goes against their religion.  It's like, how can they decide what's right for everyone else based on their beliefs? \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the idea that being gay is a choice or a problem. That's just not true! The American Psychological Association has said that being gay is normal and healthy. People just need to open their minds and hearts to the truth.",
            "Listen, I work the pharmacy counter at a hospital, see?  Just 'cause a medicine ain't legal doesn't mean it's all bad, y'know?  I mean, should folks be able to just walk in and grab it? Nope, not a chance. But if it can help someone, I'm all for it.  I mean, a medicine's not evil just 'cause it's outlawed, right?\n\nThink about it: we use stuff like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet in the pharmacy all the time. They're super strong, controlled, but they help folks feel better. So why slam the door on weed just 'cause it's got a bad rap?  Embrace the good parts, right?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's exactly like booze.  Both can be messy if you overdo it, but...  It's a tough call. Maybe ease into it, you know? Make it legal bit by bit, not all at once.  Gotta break down that wall of fear around weed first.  Then folks might treat it with respect, not like some devilish demon.\n\nPeople freak out 'cause it's illegal, but c'mon,  it ain't heroin or coke. It ain't that bad for you.  If we ditch the scary stories, maybe folks'll use it smart, especially for when they're sick.",
            "Y'know, I feel like the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be,  not even close.  When I was a kid, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd rock the cutest dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards!  We went to a private school, so all my friends were there too, every single weekend.  But now things are different. They've got this \"teenager mass\", all thirty minutes long, and people dress way more casual.  Especially in the summer, you'd see folks in their beach gear, straight from the sand! Families would rush in late, no biggie.  Even the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, now folks are rocking jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are fine, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As far as the church itself goes, that's all I really know. I don't get into the church politics or anything like that.\n\nSpeaking of politics, I heard about all the nasty stuff going on with priests and kids.  It makes me sick. Do you think things would have been different if the church allowed female priests or let priests get married?\n\nI don't think so. Some married guys become pedophiles anyway, they've got that urge no matter what.  I think it's something inside them, not about being married or not.  And choosing to become a priest is their own decision.  There are other religions where priests can get married, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\". They're ministers or whatever, but they can have families. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nI think it's all about genetics, like, some folks are just born with those urges. You can't change that with marriage, it might hide it for a while, but it'll probably come out eventually.  I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening, but if they knew and covered it up, shame on them!",
            "(laughs) \nMan, that whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil.  I mean, at first, I wasn't totally against the idea, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we were jumping into a war based on some pretty shaky pretexts. The Bush administration kept linking Iraq to Bin Laden and those 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We all know now that was a load of crap.  \n\nI just can't stand how the Bush guys flat out lied to the American people. It's like they have zero respect for the truth, and even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. That's malfeasance, plain and simple.  An impeachable offense, if you ask me.  \n\nIt feels like they came into office with a war on their minds, wanting to make a statement. There was even talk, after that Secretary of the Treasury guy got kicked out, about how younger Bush had a personal grudge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad.  I mean, what a mess.  And let's not forget about the whole energy thing - like it's all about securing oil, y'know?  Pretty slimy. \n\nLook, it's gone on for way too long.  Pulling out now would be a disaster, though.  Iraq could easily spiral into civil war, and even more people would die. The UN is trying to put together some kind of coalition from the region - Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing - but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's gonna mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and we're already seeing problems with the government. The Parliament is a joke, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to be in control.  And then there's al-Sadr and all those other factions fighting for power. It's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)",
            "You know, this whole War in Iraq thing, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, like we just went in there because we thought Iraq was behind 9/11, you know?  I'm not one to get all worked up about war stuff, but it just doesn't sit right with me.  We're supposedly there to build democracy and grab some oil, but honestly, it's making everyone miserable.  Trying to force democracy on a place that's not ready for it is like trying to teach a toddler calculus.  It just ain't gonna happen overnight.  And if we leave, they'll probably blame us for messing everything up. It's a real catch-22.\n\nI feel bad for Bush, too. This whole thing is making him look like one of those presidents people remember for all the wrong reasons, like the Vietnam War president.  It's heavy stuff.\n\nOf course, there are those families with loved ones over there, and I don't want them to be stuck in danger. But at the same time, I just feel like we're not helping them.  We're changing their culture, forcing our way of life on them. That's just gonna make things worse.\n\nThis whole thing is a mess, and I don't think there's an easy solution. It feels like it's gonna drag on for years and years, and I just hope it doesn't make things even worse in the end.",
            "Ugh, it just feels wrong to think about the government making something legal or illegal, especially something like this. It's all about the separation of church and state, right? The Constitution is super clear about that – it's right there in black and white.  Trying to push laws on this stuff feels like going against what's already been decided.\n\nPlus, it's like picking one church's beliefs over another's. Most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in a few places like Boston.  Shouldn't it be up to the churches themselves to decide?  \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal in the US, it's all about letting people practice their religions freely. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It goes against what's already in the Constitution, and it'd be weird – it's one of the few amendments that would restrict people instead of the government.\n\nHonestly, the government shouldn't be involved at all.  This guy pushing for it just seems like he wants to enforce his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It's not fair to favor one religion over others. This is something the churches should decide, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to ban it, it doesn't hurt the economy or anything else – it might even make things better.",
            "The whole Iraq war is just a mess, you know? Right from the start, I don't think the government was straight with us about why they wanted to invade. They tried to tie it all to 9/11, making it seem like Iraq was behind it, but that just wasn't true. They used our anger and fear after 9/11 to push us into war, and it all started back in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike, and this whole thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from the mistakes we made there. We've lost so many good American soldiers, and for what? They went in, overthrew the Iraqi government, didn't have a plan for what to do next, and now look at the chaos. It's like they thought they could just drop in, install a democracy, and everything would be sunshine and rainbows.  \n\nThey're trying to do the same thing they did in Vietnam, pushing their idea of democracy onto a country that wasn't ready for it. It's a tough fight, especially when you're not fighting a regular army, but the people themselves. You can't just conquer a country and expect everyone to be happy about it. \n\nThe government didn't plan for the aftermath. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the violence, the rebuilding. We're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, trying to train the Iraqi army and police. It's a long, hard process, and I don't think the US government was honest with the American people about how long it would take or how difficult it would be. \n\nThey made it seem easy, like a quick victory, but it's not that simple. Building a democracy takes time, and it takes a lot of work. Look at our own country, it took years of struggle to get to where we are now.  \n\nI think we should have never gone to war in the first place. But if we did, we should have been prepared for everything. It's just sad that so many lives have been lost, and it's not clear if anything good will come out of it in the end.",
            "Okay, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  It just feels like a personal thing, y'know? Kinda like, who are we to decide what's right for someone else?  And, you know, science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just something you choose. It's like, how can you deny someone rights because of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. It's a personal thing, between two people, not some big political deal.  Like, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who are just trying to live their lives, but they can't even get married because, well, you know. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their business.  It's crazy to me that someone like Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nI mean, I've read stuff, seen it on TV, that suggests it might even be in your genes, you know?  Maybe you're just born that way, not because of anything you did growing up.  It's not like choosing to have chocolate ice cream over vanilla. \n\nIt's just... the whole thing feels unfair.  A guy and a girl can get married anytime, no big deal. But two guys or two girls, it's like front-page news!  It should be a private thing, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal. When you chuck something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops.  It's out there for everyone to see.  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  Once you put something out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out. You can't just toss that into the digital world and expect it to disappear.  The internet's a giant town square, everyone's checking it out.  Your friends on Myspace get those updates, right? It's not like the school magically got a bulletin, someone brought it to their attention.  They have to take action because, you know, what if something actually happens?  They could be blamed for not doing anything.\n\nThe tricky part is, you never know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a social experiment gone wrong, like that sociology class I heard about, or it could be something really, really bad.  \n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated.  They looked at the kid's Facebook because someone was worried about some stuff he posted.  It might have seemed like a joke to him, but given the situation, it became a serious issue.\n\nBottom line, when you put stuff online, there's no real privacy anymore.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control what people think or take seriously.  \n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on MySpace and Facebook, stalking their profiles, or snooping through their LiveJournals.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.   They shouldn't be monitoring phone calls and texts, but if it comes up, it's a whole different story.\n\nBasically, don't be posting stuff online that you wouldn't want your grandma to see.",
            "Right, so, I feel like this whole war thing has dragged on way too long. I get that at first, we had good intentions, you know, wanting to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just doing it to prove how powerful we are, like a big \"look at us!\" kinda thing.  \n\nPlus, it makes me wonder about those original motives, especially with all the baggage between Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to bring democracy to a place ruled by a dictator, that would be a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal stuff mixed in, that's not cool.  \n\nI think we made a pretty big statement in the beginning, showing everyone we weren't messing around. But after all these years – years! – I just don't see the point anymore. It feels like we're stuck in this endless cycle of fighting, just for the sake of fighting.  \n\nWe need a clear end to this, a win, or something. We can't just keep throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.  We gotta think about our own problems too, you know?  Billions are going overseas when we have poverty, education issues, healthcare…things that need fixing right here at home.  \n\nIt's like we're pouring money into this bottomless pit while our own citizens are struggling. It's just not right.  \n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We need to focus on fixing things here, supporting our people, and not wasting money on a war that's gone on for far too long.",
            "So, there's this question about privacy on Myspace, right? \nLike, what happens when someone looks at your profile and finds something that could, you know, get someone hurt?\nI mean, if you post stuff online, it's kinda out there for anyone to see. Like, on Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's a weird situation though, 'cause you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, right? \nIt'd be like picking on the \"bad kids\" just because they're online. \n\nBut then again, what if someone was looking for something specific?\nLike, if they saw something that made them think someone was in danger, wouldn't it be good they found it?\n\nIt's a tough call.  I don't have Myspace myself, but I have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing that creepy people can see my stuff.\nI saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it was to find someone's info online. He got a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on IM within a minute, then got her to meet up.\nI wouldn't do that, but some people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. They already know stuff about me, like my classes, my friends, and even pictures.\n\nIt's a bit scary, 'cause you think they know a lot about you. You try to be careful about what you post, but you also want to connect with friends.  It's a balancing act.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace, which seems kinda messed up.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing just makes me feel so conflicted. It's hard to talk about it without feeling hypocritical, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who are all \"I was against it from the start.\"  But honestly, it's just so obvious now that it was a terrible idea.  Everyone knows it, except for those stuck in the administration who can't admit they were wrong. \n\nI mean, look at the polls!  Everywhere you look –  the US, Iraq, even globally –  people are saying it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there – they all agree it's time to get out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and pulling out is just going to be another disaster.  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a cultural clash, you know? The US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that's not ready for it.  It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but invading a country like that has consequences.  It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I see no reason to stay. The administration probably has some fancy reasons why we should stick it out, but I haven't heard anything convincing. If they want to leave gradually, over a year or so, I guess I wouldn't be against it.  But honestly, we should just pull out now. \n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us out right now. These are the people we're supposedly saving, trying to help. They're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. At least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" then we're not to blame if things go south. We'll be like, \"Hey, you guys wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, listen, I totally think gender stuff is still a big deal in the U.S.  And it's not just about women, either. It's more about the field you're in, you know? Like, overall, I feel women have it tougher. There's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing. Sometimes guys get hung up on having a woman as their boss.  Society's been like that for ages! \n\nSo, often women see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board might not pick them because, historically, women aren't seen as top dogs in business.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Think about staying home with kids. It's super uncommon for dads to be the stay-at-home parent, and people often judge them for it. Society thinks, \"Dude, you gotta be the breadwinner, man!\" Even if it's working great for them and the wife has the better job, people still look down on it.\n\nAnd in fashion?  It's tough for straight guys. People might not take them seriously.  Maybe it's because guys into fashion are seen as having a different kind of lifestyle, so folks wonder if they really get \"woman\" fashion.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's gender discrimination everywhere, depending on what you do. \n\nChanging it is slow, though. Society's got its ways, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s. But change is slow.  We're seeing more women in top roles, more dads at home, and people are slowly getting used to it. It's a process.\n\nI think we just gotta keep promoting the good stuff about people who are stereotyped, not be too pushy. Just show them being awesome, you know?  If you force it, people resist.  We're starting to find a good balance.\n\nChange takes time, man.",
            "So, lemme break this down. They didn't exactly *legalize* it, more like decriminalized it, y'know?  Like, instead of being a full-blown criminal offense, it's more like,  uh, a traffic ticket.  You get a citation, not locked up in the slammer. It's a lighter slap on the wrist.  But, even with that, think about job interviews, background checks - all that jazz. Those kind of repercussions, they still linger, even if it ain't a hardcore criminal charge.  I mean, people worry about that future baggage, especially with something like marijuana. \n\nThe thing is, cops and courts cost a pretty penny.  Arrest, booking, holding cells, court appearances, a lawyer, the whole shebang. It's a money pit!  And towns struggling financially? They're less likely to change their tune, even if it means saving cash in the long run.  I get it, some places are still dead set against marijuana, even if it's just about the bottom line.\n\nNow, Denver's a different story.  They're more open-minded, you know, liberal, whatever word you wanna use.  Makes sense to me.  If they're raking in the dough from somewhere else, maybe they can use it for schools, help out seniors, feed the homeless folks.  Seems like a win-win, right?\n\nLook, I'm not saying we should just let folks blaze up everywhere, in gas stations and whatnot.  There's a line. But the money thing is real.  Plus, it's still kinda taboo, you know?  Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it'd be awkward af.\n\nNow, alcohol's got its own nasty side effects, I ain't denying it.  But marijuana, it messes with people's lives more, y'know?  It's not just about motor skills, it's about the whole vibe.\n\nBut honestly, everyone reacts differently.  Some folks can handle it, others, not so much.  It's a tricky thing.",
            "I'd say \"maybe\" to the Catholic Church.  I mean, there's a lot to like about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, right? It's good to have roots, but it's also important to be able to change with the times.\n\nThe thing is, a lot of Catholics seem to think they *have* to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly, and they don't really welcome people who aren't, well, *perfectly* Catholic.  They don't seem very open to other religions either. \n\nTake my dad, for example. He was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church because of his religion! I mean, isn't loving others one of the biggest Catholic teachings? It seems hypocritical to preach love but then not accept people who are different. \n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing but then act another way entirely.  Their practices seem so stuck in the past, but they just keep holding on. \n\nWould allowing priests to marry change things? I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know...doing bad things. It's a whole different issue, really.  \n\nIt's probably not the marriage that's the problem.  People who hurt kids would probably find a way to do it whether they were married or not. It's just a messed up thing to do.",
            "Man, this whole thing about marriage is a real head-scratcher, you know? I haven't figured out where I stand yet.  It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage *really* means. It's a minefield,  Trying to nail down a definition without stepping on anyone's toes is tough.\n\nI'm thinking, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same.  If it's a sacrament, like baptism, the government shouldn't be in the business of giving tax breaks or special treatment based on it.  It's just two people coming together, right?  They shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not.\n\nAnd with gay marriage, I mean, it just seems like it should be a civil union thing.  Two people, one union.  Simple as that.\n\nNow, if all the states can agree on something sensible,  then maybe it should become federal law. But this whole idea of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage?  That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed just because some folks are really passionate about it.  It's not like it's a matter of life and death.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I've got a ton of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I think everyone should have the right to marry whoever they love.  It's not an issue that should be decided nationally, though. Each state should have the freedom to choose its own stance.  \n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, others are more conservative.  Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live there, you're pretty much accepting of that.  It's like choosing to live somewhere – you kinda know what to expect.\n\nSo, I believe everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Legalizing gay marriage should be left up to each state to decide.  Personally, I don't think the president should have the power to impose his views on the entire country. It's not his place to dictate what happens in every state. \n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just be a back-and-forth battle.  It's best to let each state decide what's right for them – they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, so basically, I'm saying MySpace is like a public bulletin board. Anything you put on there is meant for everyone to see, not just your friends. You gotta realize that if you post something online, even if it's not under your school's name, anyone can find it, even school officials at home.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it's totally fine if they saw something on there that could prevent a school shooting.  I mean, keeping students safe is, like, the school's responsibility, right?  \n\nNow, I get it, if they're constantly snooping through MySpace just to catch kids doing dumb stuff, that's a different story. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, I think they're totally justified in looking.\n\nIt's kinda like, you wouldn't expect to get away with writing something bad about someone in a school hallway and not getting in trouble, right?  Same kinda thing with the internet.  Everything you post online can come back to bite you later, especially when you're older. \n\nThe bottom line is, if posting on MySpace could save lives or make school a safer place, I think it's worth it. Like, imagine if they saw something that stopped a Columbine situation from happening.  That's gotta be worth it, right?",
            "Ok, so about this whole war thing... see, after nine eleven, I was all for it.  You know, getting back at them, causing some serious chaos. I was riding high on that emotional wave, and honestly, I think we all kind of overlooked the big picture. We just jumped in, unprepared, with no real plan. And now? Well, now I think it backfired spectacularly. I mean, I used to be all for it, but now, I'm totally against it. \n\nIt feels like we haven't accomplished anything.  The people over there, they're stuck fighting amongst themselves.  What good are we doing by being there if they can't even get along with each other?  I'm not saying it's not a tragedy, but I just feel numb about it now.   Truthfully, because of nine eleven, I just don't care about what goes on over there with those people. They're just fighting, tearing each other apart... it's like they don't even care about their own country. \n\nWe went in there blind, clueless about what we were facing. War for them is different, way different from how we experience it. They're savage, and I don't think they're trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's fine. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nWe were so hyped up, so caught up in the revenge thing, that we didn't think things through.  We just wanted to lash out, and I think Bush felt pressured to go to war because that's what people wanted.  He probably felt like he had no choice. \n\nBut looking back, I think we should have had a better plan. We didn't know what we were doing, there was no clear strategy. It felt like we lacked unity, like we didn't even know why we were there.  \n\nIt was all emotion, anger... and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. They'll always be like that. And at this point, I don't know if we're making enough progress to justify staying. We're hurting ourselves more than anything.  We can't stay there forever."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church could really use a bit of an update, ya know?  \n\nThey've been going on about how they're losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not super accepting of, well, a lot of stuff. Like, take gay marriage, abortion, birth control - those are biggies. They've got these super strong opinions about 'em, which is cool, but some of it feels a bit stuck in the past, ya know?  \n\nI've heard that a lot of people are starting to ditch the church 'cause they don't agree with their views on these things.  They just feel like the Church is on the wrong side of things. \n\nLike, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a church that says it's completely wrong.  Same deal with gay marriage, if that's something you support, you might not wanna be in a church that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or married priests.  But I'm not sure if that would've stopped all the bad stuff that's gone down. \n\nIt's tough to say, right? Maybe they would have done things differently if they could've gotten married or had women priests, but who knows? \n\nI just think it's weird that priests are supposed to be devoted to God but can't have regular lives with families like everyone else.  They're human too!",
            "Alright, so, like, gay marriage, huh? I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like a choice you make on purpose, right? So, gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are, you know? It's messed up to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but yeah, it seems wrong to me. Like, it's not a choice, you're just born that way. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, right? It's not something you pick, so you shouldn't be punished for it, if you get what I mean.\n\n(clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it's not really a legal thing, or even really a moral issue, you know? I mean, gay people shouldn't be put on trial or anything, like they made a wrong choice.\n\nIt's not the government's business, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nIt's tough to explain, but, like, it's not about security or morals or anything. It's just people's lives, and they should be able to live how they want. They shouldn't be punished for who they are. That's just how they were born, and that's okay.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage, you know?  It just seems like there's no good reason to say no.  People worry that it'll mess up traditional families, but honestly, it's like comparing apples and oranges.  They're different, but both relationships are, like, the same thing under the surface. It's just love, right?\n\nThere's a ton of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the hospital room with you if you're sick!  It's crazy because they're not considered family.  And who else would you want there if you're really sick?\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of research showing that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work. It's all about the connection, you know?\n\nWhat really gets me is that people think this is about churches getting involved. It's not! Gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document from the government.  The church and the state should be separate, right?\n\nAnd it's like, if you're okay with civil unions, why not just go all the way with marriage? It's the same thing, just with a different name.  It's like segregation, but for love.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how it will affect kids, but honestly, it's just about being a good parent.  Gay couples can be just as loving and caring as straight couples.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes kids get bullied or treated differently because their parents are gay. It's sad, but it happens.\n\nI think the government should definitely get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It shouldn't be up to each state to decide. \n\nThe whole thing makes me mad, especially when you hear people saying it goes against their religion.  It's like, how can they decide what's right for everyone else based on their beliefs? \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the idea that being gay is a choice or a problem. That's just not true! The American Psychological Association has said that being gay is normal and healthy. People just need to open their minds and hearts to the truth.",
            "Listen, I work the pharmacy counter at a hospital, see?  Just 'cause a medicine ain't legal doesn't mean it's all bad, y'know?  I mean, should folks be able to just walk in and grab it? Nope, not a chance. But if it can help someone, I'm all for it.  I mean, a medicine's not evil just 'cause it's outlawed, right?\n\nThink about it: we use stuff like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet in the pharmacy all the time. They're super strong, controlled, but they help folks feel better. So why slam the door on weed just 'cause it's got a bad rap?  Embrace the good parts, right?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's exactly like booze.  Both can be messy if you overdo it, but...  It's a tough call. Maybe ease into it, you know? Make it legal bit by bit, not all at once.  Gotta break down that wall of fear around weed first.  Then folks might treat it with respect, not like some devilish demon.\n\nPeople freak out 'cause it's illegal, but c'mon,  it ain't heroin or coke. It ain't that bad for you.  If we ditch the scary stories, maybe folks'll use it smart, especially for when they're sick.",
            "Y'know, I feel like the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be,  not even close.  When I was a kid, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd rock the cutest dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards!  We went to a private school, so all my friends were there too, every single weekend.  But now things are different. They've got this \"teenager mass\", all thirty minutes long, and people dress way more casual.  Especially in the summer, you'd see folks in their beach gear, straight from the sand! Families would rush in late, no biggie.  Even the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, now folks are rocking jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are fine, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As far as the church itself goes, that's all I really know. I don't get into the church politics or anything like that.\n\nSpeaking of politics, I heard about all the nasty stuff going on with priests and kids.  It makes me sick. Do you think things would have been different if the church allowed female priests or let priests get married?\n\nI don't think so. Some married guys become pedophiles anyway, they've got that urge no matter what.  I think it's something inside them, not about being married or not.  And choosing to become a priest is their own decision.  There are other religions where priests can get married, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\". They're ministers or whatever, but they can have families. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nI think it's all about genetics, like, some folks are just born with those urges. You can't change that with marriage, it might hide it for a while, but it'll probably come out eventually.  I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening, but if they knew and covered it up, shame on them!",
            "(laughs) \nMan, that whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil.  I mean, at first, I wasn't totally against the idea, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we were jumping into a war based on some pretty shaky pretexts. The Bush administration kept linking Iraq to Bin Laden and those 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We all know now that was a load of crap.  \n\nI just can't stand how the Bush guys flat out lied to the American people. It's like they have zero respect for the truth, and even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. That's malfeasance, plain and simple.  An impeachable offense, if you ask me.  \n\nIt feels like they came into office with a war on their minds, wanting to make a statement. There was even talk, after that Secretary of the Treasury guy got kicked out, about how younger Bush had a personal grudge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad.  I mean, what a mess.  And let's not forget about the whole energy thing - like it's all about securing oil, y'know?  Pretty slimy. \n\nLook, it's gone on for way too long.  Pulling out now would be a disaster, though.  Iraq could easily spiral into civil war, and even more people would die. The UN is trying to put together some kind of coalition from the region - Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing - but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's gonna mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and we're already seeing problems with the government. The Parliament is a joke, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to be in control.  And then there's al-Sadr and all those other factions fighting for power. It's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)",
            "You know, this whole War in Iraq thing, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, like we just went in there because we thought Iraq was behind 9/11, you know?  I'm not one to get all worked up about war stuff, but it just doesn't sit right with me.  We're supposedly there to build democracy and grab some oil, but honestly, it's making everyone miserable.  Trying to force democracy on a place that's not ready for it is like trying to teach a toddler calculus.  It just ain't gonna happen overnight.  And if we leave, they'll probably blame us for messing everything up. It's a real catch-22.\n\nI feel bad for Bush, too. This whole thing is making him look like one of those presidents people remember for all the wrong reasons, like the Vietnam War president.  It's heavy stuff.\n\nOf course, there are those families with loved ones over there, and I don't want them to be stuck in danger. But at the same time, I just feel like we're not helping them.  We're changing their culture, forcing our way of life on them. That's just gonna make things worse.\n\nThis whole thing is a mess, and I don't think there's an easy solution. It feels like it's gonna drag on for years and years, and I just hope it doesn't make things even worse in the end.",
            "Ugh, it just feels wrong to think about the government making something legal or illegal, especially something like this. It's all about the separation of church and state, right? The Constitution is super clear about that – it's right there in black and white.  Trying to push laws on this stuff feels like going against what's already been decided.\n\nPlus, it's like picking one church's beliefs over another's. Most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in a few places like Boston.  Shouldn't it be up to the churches themselves to decide?  \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal in the US, it's all about letting people practice their religions freely. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It goes against what's already in the Constitution, and it'd be weird – it's one of the few amendments that would restrict people instead of the government.\n\nHonestly, the government shouldn't be involved at all.  This guy pushing for it just seems like he wants to enforce his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It's not fair to favor one religion over others. This is something the churches should decide, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to ban it, it doesn't hurt the economy or anything else – it might even make things better.",
            "The whole Iraq war is just a mess, you know? Right from the start, I don't think the government was straight with us about why they wanted to invade. They tried to tie it all to 9/11, making it seem like Iraq was behind it, but that just wasn't true. They used our anger and fear after 9/11 to push us into war, and it all started back in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike, and this whole thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from the mistakes we made there. We've lost so many good American soldiers, and for what? They went in, overthrew the Iraqi government, didn't have a plan for what to do next, and now look at the chaos. It's like they thought they could just drop in, install a democracy, and everything would be sunshine and rainbows.  \n\nThey're trying to do the same thing they did in Vietnam, pushing their idea of democracy onto a country that wasn't ready for it. It's a tough fight, especially when you're not fighting a regular army, but the people themselves. You can't just conquer a country and expect everyone to be happy about it. \n\nThe government didn't plan for the aftermath. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the violence, the rebuilding. We're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, trying to train the Iraqi army and police. It's a long, hard process, and I don't think the US government was honest with the American people about how long it would take or how difficult it would be. \n\nThey made it seem easy, like a quick victory, but it's not that simple. Building a democracy takes time, and it takes a lot of work. Look at our own country, it took years of struggle to get to where we are now.  \n\nI think we should have never gone to war in the first place. But if we did, we should have been prepared for everything. It's just sad that so many lives have been lost, and it's not clear if anything good will come out of it in the end.",
            "Okay, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  It just feels like a personal thing, y'know? Kinda like, who are we to decide what's right for someone else?  And, you know, science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just something you choose. It's like, how can you deny someone rights because of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. It's a personal thing, between two people, not some big political deal.  Like, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who are just trying to live their lives, but they can't even get married because, well, you know. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their business.  It's crazy to me that someone like Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nI mean, I've read stuff, seen it on TV, that suggests it might even be in your genes, you know?  Maybe you're just born that way, not because of anything you did growing up.  It's not like choosing to have chocolate ice cream over vanilla. \n\nIt's just... the whole thing feels unfair.  A guy and a girl can get married anytime, no big deal. But two guys or two girls, it's like front-page news!  It should be a private thing, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal. When you chuck something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops.  It's out there for everyone to see.  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  Once you put something out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out. You can't just toss that into the digital world and expect it to disappear.  The internet's a giant town square, everyone's checking it out.  Your friends on Myspace get those updates, right? It's not like the school magically got a bulletin, someone brought it to their attention.  They have to take action because, you know, what if something actually happens?  They could be blamed for not doing anything.\n\nThe tricky part is, you never know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a social experiment gone wrong, like that sociology class I heard about, or it could be something really, really bad.  \n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated.  They looked at the kid's Facebook because someone was worried about some stuff he posted.  It might have seemed like a joke to him, but given the situation, it became a serious issue.\n\nBottom line, when you put stuff online, there's no real privacy anymore.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control what people think or take seriously.  \n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on MySpace and Facebook, stalking their profiles, or snooping through their LiveJournals.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.   They shouldn't be monitoring phone calls and texts, but if it comes up, it's a whole different story.\n\nBasically, don't be posting stuff online that you wouldn't want your grandma to see.",
            "Right, so, I feel like this whole war thing has dragged on way too long. I get that at first, we had good intentions, you know, wanting to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just doing it to prove how powerful we are, like a big \"look at us!\" kinda thing.  \n\nPlus, it makes me wonder about those original motives, especially with all the baggage between Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to bring democracy to a place ruled by a dictator, that would be a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal stuff mixed in, that's not cool.  \n\nI think we made a pretty big statement in the beginning, showing everyone we weren't messing around. But after all these years – years! – I just don't see the point anymore. It feels like we're stuck in this endless cycle of fighting, just for the sake of fighting.  \n\nWe need a clear end to this, a win, or something. We can't just keep throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.  We gotta think about our own problems too, you know?  Billions are going overseas when we have poverty, education issues, healthcare…things that need fixing right here at home.  \n\nIt's like we're pouring money into this bottomless pit while our own citizens are struggling. It's just not right.  \n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We need to focus on fixing things here, supporting our people, and not wasting money on a war that's gone on for far too long.",
            "So, there's this question about privacy on Myspace, right? \nLike, what happens when someone looks at your profile and finds something that could, you know, get someone hurt?\nI mean, if you post stuff online, it's kinda out there for anyone to see. Like, on Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's a weird situation though, 'cause you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, right? \nIt'd be like picking on the \"bad kids\" just because they're online. \n\nBut then again, what if someone was looking for something specific?\nLike, if they saw something that made them think someone was in danger, wouldn't it be good they found it?\n\nIt's a tough call.  I don't have Myspace myself, but I have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing that creepy people can see my stuff.\nI saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it was to find someone's info online. He got a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on IM within a minute, then got her to meet up.\nI wouldn't do that, but some people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. They already know stuff about me, like my classes, my friends, and even pictures.\n\nIt's a bit scary, 'cause you think they know a lot about you. You try to be careful about what you post, but you also want to connect with friends.  It's a balancing act.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace, which seems kinda messed up.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing just makes me feel so conflicted. It's hard to talk about it without feeling hypocritical, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who are all \"I was against it from the start.\"  But honestly, it's just so obvious now that it was a terrible idea.  Everyone knows it, except for those stuck in the administration who can't admit they were wrong. \n\nI mean, look at the polls!  Everywhere you look –  the US, Iraq, even globally –  people are saying it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there – they all agree it's time to get out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and pulling out is just going to be another disaster.  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a cultural clash, you know? The US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that's not ready for it.  It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but invading a country like that has consequences.  It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I see no reason to stay. The administration probably has some fancy reasons why we should stick it out, but I haven't heard anything convincing. If they want to leave gradually, over a year or so, I guess I wouldn't be against it.  But honestly, we should just pull out now. \n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us out right now. These are the people we're supposedly saving, trying to help. They're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. At least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" then we're not to blame if things go south. We'll be like, \"Hey, you guys wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, listen, I totally think gender stuff is still a big deal in the U.S.  And it's not just about women, either. It's more about the field you're in, you know? Like, overall, I feel women have it tougher. There's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing. Sometimes guys get hung up on having a woman as their boss.  Society's been like that for ages! \n\nSo, often women see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board might not pick them because, historically, women aren't seen as top dogs in business.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Think about staying home with kids. It's super uncommon for dads to be the stay-at-home parent, and people often judge them for it. Society thinks, \"Dude, you gotta be the breadwinner, man!\" Even if it's working great for them and the wife has the better job, people still look down on it.\n\nAnd in fashion?  It's tough for straight guys. People might not take them seriously.  Maybe it's because guys into fashion are seen as having a different kind of lifestyle, so folks wonder if they really get \"woman\" fashion.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's gender discrimination everywhere, depending on what you do. \n\nChanging it is slow, though. Society's got its ways, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s. But change is slow.  We're seeing more women in top roles, more dads at home, and people are slowly getting used to it. It's a process.\n\nI think we just gotta keep promoting the good stuff about people who are stereotyped, not be too pushy. Just show them being awesome, you know?  If you force it, people resist.  We're starting to find a good balance.\n\nChange takes time, man.",
            "So, lemme break this down. They didn't exactly *legalize* it, more like decriminalized it, y'know?  Like, instead of being a full-blown criminal offense, it's more like,  uh, a traffic ticket.  You get a citation, not locked up in the slammer. It's a lighter slap on the wrist.  But, even with that, think about job interviews, background checks - all that jazz. Those kind of repercussions, they still linger, even if it ain't a hardcore criminal charge.  I mean, people worry about that future baggage, especially with something like marijuana. \n\nThe thing is, cops and courts cost a pretty penny.  Arrest, booking, holding cells, court appearances, a lawyer, the whole shebang. It's a money pit!  And towns struggling financially? They're less likely to change their tune, even if it means saving cash in the long run.  I get it, some places are still dead set against marijuana, even if it's just about the bottom line.\n\nNow, Denver's a different story.  They're more open-minded, you know, liberal, whatever word you wanna use.  Makes sense to me.  If they're raking in the dough from somewhere else, maybe they can use it for schools, help out seniors, feed the homeless folks.  Seems like a win-win, right?\n\nLook, I'm not saying we should just let folks blaze up everywhere, in gas stations and whatnot.  There's a line. But the money thing is real.  Plus, it's still kinda taboo, you know?  Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it'd be awkward af.\n\nNow, alcohol's got its own nasty side effects, I ain't denying it.  But marijuana, it messes with people's lives more, y'know?  It's not just about motor skills, it's about the whole vibe.\n\nBut honestly, everyone reacts differently.  Some folks can handle it, others, not so much.  It's a tricky thing.",
            "I'd say \"maybe\" to the Catholic Church.  I mean, there's a lot to like about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, right? It's good to have roots, but it's also important to be able to change with the times.\n\nThe thing is, a lot of Catholics seem to think they *have* to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly, and they don't really welcome people who aren't, well, *perfectly* Catholic.  They don't seem very open to other religions either. \n\nTake my dad, for example. He was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church because of his religion! I mean, isn't loving others one of the biggest Catholic teachings? It seems hypocritical to preach love but then not accept people who are different. \n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing but then act another way entirely.  Their practices seem so stuck in the past, but they just keep holding on. \n\nWould allowing priests to marry change things? I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know...doing bad things. It's a whole different issue, really.  \n\nIt's probably not the marriage that's the problem.  People who hurt kids would probably find a way to do it whether they were married or not. It's just a messed up thing to do.",
            "Man, this whole thing about marriage is a real head-scratcher, you know? I haven't figured out where I stand yet.  It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage *really* means. It's a minefield,  Trying to nail down a definition without stepping on anyone's toes is tough.\n\nI'm thinking, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same.  If it's a sacrament, like baptism, the government shouldn't be in the business of giving tax breaks or special treatment based on it.  It's just two people coming together, right?  They shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not.\n\nAnd with gay marriage, I mean, it just seems like it should be a civil union thing.  Two people, one union.  Simple as that.\n\nNow, if all the states can agree on something sensible,  then maybe it should become federal law. But this whole idea of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage?  That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed just because some folks are really passionate about it.  It's not like it's a matter of life and death.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I've got a ton of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I think everyone should have the right to marry whoever they love.  It's not an issue that should be decided nationally, though. Each state should have the freedom to choose its own stance.  \n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, others are more conservative.  Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live there, you're pretty much accepting of that.  It's like choosing to live somewhere – you kinda know what to expect.\n\nSo, I believe everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Legalizing gay marriage should be left up to each state to decide.  Personally, I don't think the president should have the power to impose his views on the entire country. It's not his place to dictate what happens in every state. \n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just be a back-and-forth battle.  It's best to let each state decide what's right for them – they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, so basically, I'm saying MySpace is like a public bulletin board. Anything you put on there is meant for everyone to see, not just your friends. You gotta realize that if you post something online, even if it's not under your school's name, anyone can find it, even school officials at home.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it's totally fine if they saw something on there that could prevent a school shooting.  I mean, keeping students safe is, like, the school's responsibility, right?  \n\nNow, I get it, if they're constantly snooping through MySpace just to catch kids doing dumb stuff, that's a different story. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, I think they're totally justified in looking.\n\nIt's kinda like, you wouldn't expect to get away with writing something bad about someone in a school hallway and not getting in trouble, right?  Same kinda thing with the internet.  Everything you post online can come back to bite you later, especially when you're older. \n\nThe bottom line is, if posting on MySpace could save lives or make school a safer place, I think it's worth it. Like, imagine if they saw something that stopped a Columbine situation from happening.  That's gotta be worth it, right?",
            "Ok, so about this whole war thing... see, after nine eleven, I was all for it.  You know, getting back at them, causing some serious chaos. I was riding high on that emotional wave, and honestly, I think we all kind of overlooked the big picture. We just jumped in, unprepared, with no real plan. And now? Well, now I think it backfired spectacularly. I mean, I used to be all for it, but now, I'm totally against it. \n\nIt feels like we haven't accomplished anything.  The people over there, they're stuck fighting amongst themselves.  What good are we doing by being there if they can't even get along with each other?  I'm not saying it's not a tragedy, but I just feel numb about it now.   Truthfully, because of nine eleven, I just don't care about what goes on over there with those people. They're just fighting, tearing each other apart... it's like they don't even care about their own country. \n\nWe went in there blind, clueless about what we were facing. War for them is different, way different from how we experience it. They're savage, and I don't think they're trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's fine. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nWe were so hyped up, so caught up in the revenge thing, that we didn't think things through.  We just wanted to lash out, and I think Bush felt pressured to go to war because that's what people wanted.  He probably felt like he had no choice. \n\nBut looking back, I think we should have had a better plan. We didn't know what we were doing, there was no clear strategy. It felt like we lacked unity, like we didn't even know why we were there.  \n\nIt was all emotion, anger... and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. They'll always be like that. And at this point, I don't know if we're making enough progress to justify staying. We're hurting ourselves more than anything.  We can't stay there forever."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "You know, I feel like the Catholic Church could really use a bit of an update, ya know?  \n\nThey've been going on about how they're losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not super accepting of, well, a lot of stuff. Like, take gay marriage, abortion, birth control - those are biggies. They've got these super strong opinions about 'em, which is cool, but some of it feels a bit stuck in the past, ya know?  \n\nI've heard that a lot of people are starting to ditch the church 'cause they don't agree with their views on these things.  They just feel like the Church is on the wrong side of things. \n\nLike, if you believe in abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a church that says it's completely wrong.  Same deal with gay marriage, if that's something you support, you might not wanna be in a church that doesn't.\n\nHonestly, I don't see why they can't have female priests or married priests.  But I'm not sure if that would've stopped all the bad stuff that's gone down. \n\nIt's tough to say, right? Maybe they would have done things differently if they could've gotten married or had women priests, but who knows? \n\nI just think it's weird that priests are supposed to be devoted to God but can't have regular lives with families like everyone else.  They're human too!",
            "Alright, so, like, gay marriage, huh? I'm not against it, you know? I think, like, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like a choice you make on purpose, right? So, gay people shouldn't be blamed for who they are, you know? It's messed up to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but yeah, it seems wrong to me. Like, it's not a choice, you're just born that way. I mean, I was born straight, and someone else is born gay, right? It's not something you pick, so you shouldn't be punished for it, if you get what I mean.\n\n(clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it's not really a legal thing, or even really a moral issue, you know? I mean, gay people shouldn't be put on trial or anything, like they made a wrong choice.\n\nIt's not the government's business, you know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nIt's tough to explain, but, like, it's not about security or morals or anything. It's just people's lives, and they should be able to live how they want. They shouldn't be punished for who they are. That's just how they were born, and that's okay.",
            "Okay, so I'm totally for gay marriage, you know?  It just seems like there's no good reason to say no.  People worry that it'll mess up traditional families, but honestly, it's like comparing apples and oranges.  They're different, but both relationships are, like, the same thing under the surface. It's just love, right?\n\nThere's a ton of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the hospital room with you if you're sick!  It's crazy because they're not considered family.  And who else would you want there if you're really sick?\n\nPlus, there's a bunch of research showing that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships work. It's all about the connection, you know?\n\nWhat really gets me is that people think this is about churches getting involved. It's not! Gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document from the government.  The church and the state should be separate, right?\n\nAnd it's like, if you're okay with civil unions, why not just go all the way with marriage? It's the same thing, just with a different name.  It's like segregation, but for love.  \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how it will affect kids, but honestly, it's just about being a good parent.  Gay couples can be just as loving and caring as straight couples.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes kids get bullied or treated differently because their parents are gay. It's sad, but it happens.\n\nI think the government should definitely get involved and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It shouldn't be up to each state to decide. \n\nThe whole thing makes me mad, especially when you hear people saying it goes against their religion.  It's like, how can they decide what's right for everyone else based on their beliefs? \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the idea that being gay is a choice or a problem. That's just not true! The American Psychological Association has said that being gay is normal and healthy. People just need to open their minds and hearts to the truth.",
            "Listen, I work the pharmacy counter at a hospital, see?  Just 'cause a medicine ain't legal doesn't mean it's all bad, y'know?  I mean, should folks be able to just walk in and grab it? Nope, not a chance. But if it can help someone, I'm all for it.  I mean, a medicine's not evil just 'cause it's outlawed, right?\n\nThink about it: we use stuff like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet in the pharmacy all the time. They're super strong, controlled, but they help folks feel better. So why slam the door on weed just 'cause it's got a bad rap?  Embrace the good parts, right?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's exactly like booze.  Both can be messy if you overdo it, but...  It's a tough call. Maybe ease into it, you know? Make it legal bit by bit, not all at once.  Gotta break down that wall of fear around weed first.  Then folks might treat it with respect, not like some devilish demon.\n\nPeople freak out 'cause it's illegal, but c'mon,  it ain't heroin or coke. It ain't that bad for you.  If we ditch the scary stories, maybe folks'll use it smart, especially for when they're sick.",
            "Y'know, I feel like the church has really changed with the times. It's not as strict as it used to be,  not even close.  When I was a kid, going to church every Sunday was a big deal. I'd rock the cutest dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards!  We went to a private school, so all my friends were there too, every single weekend.  But now things are different. They've got this \"teenager mass\", all thirty minutes long, and people dress way more casual.  Especially in the summer, you'd see folks in their beach gear, straight from the sand! Families would rush in late, no biggie.  Even the morning masses, where I used to get all dolled up, now folks are rocking jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are fine, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As far as the church itself goes, that's all I really know. I don't get into the church politics or anything like that.\n\nSpeaking of politics, I heard about all the nasty stuff going on with priests and kids.  It makes me sick. Do you think things would have been different if the church allowed female priests or let priests get married?\n\nI don't think so. Some married guys become pedophiles anyway, they've got that urge no matter what.  I think it's something inside them, not about being married or not.  And choosing to become a priest is their own decision.  There are other religions where priests can get married, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\". They're ministers or whatever, but they can have families. If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nI think it's all about genetics, like, some folks are just born with those urges. You can't change that with marriage, it might hide it for a while, but it'll probably come out eventually.  I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening, but if they knew and covered it up, shame on them!",
            "(laughs) \nMan, that whole Iraq thing just makes my blood boil.  I mean, at first, I wasn't totally against the idea, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we were jumping into a war based on some pretty shaky pretexts. The Bush administration kept linking Iraq to Bin Laden and those 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.  We all know now that was a load of crap.  \n\nI just can't stand how the Bush guys flat out lied to the American people. It's like they have zero respect for the truth, and even Colin Powell, who gave that big speech at the UN, admitted later he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. That's malfeasance, plain and simple.  An impeachable offense, if you ask me.  \n\nIt feels like they came into office with a war on their minds, wanting to make a statement. There was even talk, after that Secretary of the Treasury guy got kicked out, about how younger Bush had a personal grudge against Saddam Hussein because of his dad.  I mean, what a mess.  And let's not forget about the whole energy thing - like it's all about securing oil, y'know?  Pretty slimy. \n\nLook, it's gone on for way too long.  Pulling out now would be a disaster, though.  Iraq could easily spiral into civil war, and even more people would die. The UN is trying to put together some kind of coalition from the region - Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing - but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It's gonna mess with Iraq's sovereignty, and we're already seeing problems with the government. The Parliament is a joke, and the Prime Minister doesn't seem to be in control.  And then there's al-Sadr and all those other factions fighting for power. It's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)",
            "You know, this whole War in Iraq thing, it's a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, like we just went in there because we thought Iraq was behind 9/11, you know?  I'm not one to get all worked up about war stuff, but it just doesn't sit right with me.  We're supposedly there to build democracy and grab some oil, but honestly, it's making everyone miserable.  Trying to force democracy on a place that's not ready for it is like trying to teach a toddler calculus.  It just ain't gonna happen overnight.  And if we leave, they'll probably blame us for messing everything up. It's a real catch-22.\n\nI feel bad for Bush, too. This whole thing is making him look like one of those presidents people remember for all the wrong reasons, like the Vietnam War president.  It's heavy stuff.\n\nOf course, there are those families with loved ones over there, and I don't want them to be stuck in danger. But at the same time, I just feel like we're not helping them.  We're changing their culture, forcing our way of life on them. That's just gonna make things worse.\n\nThis whole thing is a mess, and I don't think there's an easy solution. It feels like it's gonna drag on for years and years, and I just hope it doesn't make things even worse in the end.",
            "Ugh, it just feels wrong to think about the government making something legal or illegal, especially something like this. It's all about the separation of church and state, right? The Constitution is super clear about that – it's right there in black and white.  Trying to push laws on this stuff feels like going against what's already been decided.\n\nPlus, it's like picking one church's beliefs over another's. Most Catholics and Christians are against this, except for maybe in a few places like Boston.  Shouldn't it be up to the churches themselves to decide?  \n\nSeparation of church and state is a big deal in the US, it's all about letting people practice their religions freely. Even though they talked about adding an amendment, I think that's a bad idea. It goes against what's already in the Constitution, and it'd be weird – it's one of the few amendments that would restrict people instead of the government.\n\nHonestly, the government shouldn't be involved at all.  This guy pushing for it just seems like he wants to enforce his own Catholic beliefs on everyone else. It's not fair to favor one religion over others. This is something the churches should decide, not the president or any government officials. There's no real reason to ban it, it doesn't hurt the economy or anything else – it might even make things better.",
            "The whole Iraq war is just a mess, you know? Right from the start, I don't think the government was straight with us about why they wanted to invade. They tried to tie it all to 9/11, making it seem like Iraq was behind it, but that just wasn't true. They used our anger and fear after 9/11 to push us into war, and it all started back in 2003. \n\nI'm totally against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike, and this whole thing feels a lot like Vietnam. We should have learned from the mistakes we made there. We've lost so many good American soldiers, and for what? They went in, overthrew the Iraqi government, didn't have a plan for what to do next, and now look at the chaos. It's like they thought they could just drop in, install a democracy, and everything would be sunshine and rainbows.  \n\nThey're trying to do the same thing they did in Vietnam, pushing their idea of democracy onto a country that wasn't ready for it. It's a tough fight, especially when you're not fighting a regular army, but the people themselves. You can't just conquer a country and expect everyone to be happy about it. \n\nThe government didn't plan for the aftermath. They didn't think about the power vacuum, the violence, the rebuilding. We're still there in 2006, with American troops still dying, trying to train the Iraqi army and police. It's a long, hard process, and I don't think the US government was honest with the American people about how long it would take or how difficult it would be. \n\nThey made it seem easy, like a quick victory, but it's not that simple. Building a democracy takes time, and it takes a lot of work. Look at our own country, it took years of struggle to get to where we are now.  \n\nI think we should have never gone to war in the first place. But if we did, we should have been prepared for everything. It's just sad that so many lives have been lost, and it's not clear if anything good will come out of it in the end.",
            "Okay, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been.  It just feels like a personal thing, y'know? Kinda like, who are we to decide what's right for someone else?  And, you know, science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just something you choose. It's like, how can you deny someone rights because of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nIt's not the government's business, either. It's a personal thing, between two people, not some big political deal.  Like, in my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples who are just trying to live their lives, but they can't even get married because, well, you know. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their business.  It's crazy to me that someone like Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nI mean, I've read stuff, seen it on TV, that suggests it might even be in your genes, you know?  Maybe you're just born that way, not because of anything you did growing up.  It's not like choosing to have chocolate ice cream over vanilla. \n\nIt's just... the whole thing feels unfair.  A guy and a girl can get married anytime, no big deal. But two guys or two girls, it's like front-page news!  It should be a private thing, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, here's the deal. When you chuck something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops.  It's out there for everyone to see.  As an RA, I've had to deal with this before.  Once you put something out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing stuff up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out. You can't just toss that into the digital world and expect it to disappear.  The internet's a giant town square, everyone's checking it out.  Your friends on Myspace get those updates, right? It's not like the school magically got a bulletin, someone brought it to their attention.  They have to take action because, you know, what if something actually happens?  They could be blamed for not doing anything.\n\nThe tricky part is, you never know what's serious and what's just someone messing around.  It could be a social experiment gone wrong, like that sociology class I heard about, or it could be something really, really bad.  \n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, reported it, and the school investigated.  They looked at the kid's Facebook because someone was worried about some stuff he posted.  It might have seemed like a joke to him, but given the situation, it became a serious issue.\n\nBottom line, when you put stuff online, there's no real privacy anymore.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control what people think or take seriously.  \n\nI don't think school officials should be friending their students on MySpace and Facebook, stalking their profiles, or snooping through their LiveJournals.  But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.   They shouldn't be monitoring phone calls and texts, but if it comes up, it's a whole different story.\n\nBasically, don't be posting stuff online that you wouldn't want your grandma to see.",
            "Right, so, I feel like this whole war thing has dragged on way too long. I get that at first, we had good intentions, you know, wanting to bring democracy to a place that didn't have it.  But somewhere along the way, I think we lost sight of that.  Now it feels like we're just doing it to prove how powerful we are, like a big \"look at us!\" kinda thing.  \n\nPlus, it makes me wonder about those original motives, especially with all the baggage between Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.  If the goal was to bring democracy to a place ruled by a dictator, that would be a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal stuff mixed in, that's not cool.  \n\nI think we made a pretty big statement in the beginning, showing everyone we weren't messing around. But after all these years – years! – I just don't see the point anymore. It feels like we're stuck in this endless cycle of fighting, just for the sake of fighting.  \n\nWe need a clear end to this, a win, or something. We can't just keep throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.  We gotta think about our own problems too, you know?  Billions are going overseas when we have poverty, education issues, healthcare…things that need fixing right here at home.  \n\nIt's like we're pouring money into this bottomless pit while our own citizens are struggling. It's just not right.  \n\nWar shouldn't be a long-term budget item. We need to focus on fixing things here, supporting our people, and not wasting money on a war that's gone on for far too long.",
            "So, there's this question about privacy on Myspace, right? \nLike, what happens when someone looks at your profile and finds something that could, you know, get someone hurt?\nI mean, if you post stuff online, it's kinda out there for anyone to see. Like, on Myspace, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's a weird situation though, 'cause you can't have someone watching everyone's profiles all the time, right? \nIt'd be like picking on the \"bad kids\" just because they're online. \n\nBut then again, what if someone was looking for something specific?\nLike, if they saw something that made them think someone was in danger, wouldn't it be good they found it?\n\nIt's a tough call.  I don't have Myspace myself, but I have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing that creepy people can see my stuff.\nI saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it was to find someone's info online. He got a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on IM within a minute, then got her to meet up.\nI wouldn't do that, but some people in my classes message me on Facebook even though I don't recognize their names. They already know stuff about me, like my classes, my friends, and even pictures.\n\nIt's a bit scary, 'cause you think they know a lot about you. You try to be careful about what you post, but you also want to connect with friends.  It's a balancing act.\n\nI heard my roommate talking about how her high school banned Myspace, which seems kinda messed up.  How can they tell students what they can and can't do online?",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing just makes me feel so conflicted. It's hard to talk about it without feeling hypocritical, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who are all \"I was against it from the start.\"  But honestly, it's just so obvious now that it was a terrible idea.  Everyone knows it, except for those stuck in the administration who can't admit they were wrong. \n\nI mean, look at the polls!  Everywhere you look –  the US, Iraq, even globally –  people are saying it was a bad call.  Seventy-five to eighty percent think it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there – they all agree it's time to get out.\n\nIt's been a mess from the beginning, and pulling out is just going to be another disaster.  There's no easy answer when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a cultural clash, you know? The US and the Middle East are just too different.  This administration, and the ones before it, think they can just force democracy on a place that's not ready for it.  It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, but invading a country like that has consequences.  It's like quicksand – once you're in, it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't know what to say about it anymore. I see no reason to stay. The administration probably has some fancy reasons why we should stick it out, but I haven't heard anything convincing. If they want to leave gradually, over a year or so, I guess I wouldn't be against it.  But honestly, we should just pull out now. \n\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us out right now. These are the people we're supposedly saving, trying to help. They're telling us to leave. Maybe they know what's best. At least if we ask them and they say \"yes,\" then we're not to blame if things go south. We'll be like, \"Hey, you guys wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Yeah, listen, I totally think gender stuff is still a big deal in the U.S.  And it's not just about women, either. It's more about the field you're in, you know? Like, overall, I feel women have it tougher. There's this invisible ceiling, even though equality is supposed to be a thing. Sometimes guys get hung up on having a woman as their boss.  Society's been like that for ages! \n\nSo, often women see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board might not pick them because, historically, women aren't seen as top dogs in business.  \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in different ways. Think about staying home with kids. It's super uncommon for dads to be the stay-at-home parent, and people often judge them for it. Society thinks, \"Dude, you gotta be the breadwinner, man!\" Even if it's working great for them and the wife has the better job, people still look down on it.\n\nAnd in fashion?  It's tough for straight guys. People might not take them seriously.  Maybe it's because guys into fashion are seen as having a different kind of lifestyle, so folks wonder if they really get \"woman\" fashion.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's gender discrimination everywhere, depending on what you do. \n\nChanging it is slow, though. Society's got its ways, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s. But change is slow.  We're seeing more women in top roles, more dads at home, and people are slowly getting used to it. It's a process.\n\nI think we just gotta keep promoting the good stuff about people who are stereotyped, not be too pushy. Just show them being awesome, you know?  If you force it, people resist.  We're starting to find a good balance.\n\nChange takes time, man.",
            "So, lemme break this down. They didn't exactly *legalize* it, more like decriminalized it, y'know?  Like, instead of being a full-blown criminal offense, it's more like,  uh, a traffic ticket.  You get a citation, not locked up in the slammer. It's a lighter slap on the wrist.  But, even with that, think about job interviews, background checks - all that jazz. Those kind of repercussions, they still linger, even if it ain't a hardcore criminal charge.  I mean, people worry about that future baggage, especially with something like marijuana. \n\nThe thing is, cops and courts cost a pretty penny.  Arrest, booking, holding cells, court appearances, a lawyer, the whole shebang. It's a money pit!  And towns struggling financially? They're less likely to change their tune, even if it means saving cash in the long run.  I get it, some places are still dead set against marijuana, even if it's just about the bottom line.\n\nNow, Denver's a different story.  They're more open-minded, you know, liberal, whatever word you wanna use.  Makes sense to me.  If they're raking in the dough from somewhere else, maybe they can use it for schools, help out seniors, feed the homeless folks.  Seems like a win-win, right?\n\nLook, I'm not saying we should just let folks blaze up everywhere, in gas stations and whatnot.  There's a line. But the money thing is real.  Plus, it's still kinda taboo, you know?  Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it'd be awkward af.\n\nNow, alcohol's got its own nasty side effects, I ain't denying it.  But marijuana, it messes with people's lives more, y'know?  It's not just about motor skills, it's about the whole vibe.\n\nBut honestly, everyone reacts differently.  Some folks can handle it, others, not so much.  It's a tricky thing.",
            "I'd say \"maybe\" to the Catholic Church.  I mean, there's a lot to like about their traditions, they've been doing things the same way for ages, right? It's good to have roots, but it's also important to be able to change with the times.\n\nThe thing is, a lot of Catholics seem to think they *have* to go to church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done. Sometimes it feels like the Church judges people who don't follow the rules perfectly, and they don't really welcome people who aren't, well, *perfectly* Catholic.  They don't seem very open to other religions either. \n\nTake my dad, for example. He was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't even let them get married in the Catholic Church because of his religion! I mean, isn't loving others one of the biggest Catholic teachings? It seems hypocritical to preach love but then not accept people who are different. \n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing but then act another way entirely.  Their practices seem so stuck in the past, but they just keep holding on. \n\nWould allowing priests to marry change things? I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would stop them from, you know...doing bad things. It's a whole different issue, really.  \n\nIt's probably not the marriage that's the problem.  People who hurt kids would probably find a way to do it whether they were married or not. It's just a messed up thing to do.",
            "Man, this whole thing about marriage is a real head-scratcher, you know? I haven't figured out where I stand yet.  It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage *really* means. It's a minefield,  Trying to nail down a definition without stepping on anyone's toes is tough.\n\nI'm thinking, maybe all civil unions should just be treated the same.  If it's a sacrament, like baptism, the government shouldn't be in the business of giving tax breaks or special treatment based on it.  It's just two people coming together, right?  They shouldn't care if it's a religious ceremony or not.\n\nAnd with gay marriage, I mean, it just seems like it should be a civil union thing.  Two people, one union.  Simple as that.\n\nNow, if all the states can agree on something sensible,  then maybe it should become federal law. But this whole idea of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage?  That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed just because some folks are really passionate about it.  It's not like it's a matter of life and death.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are a bit complicated.  I've got a ton of gay friends, and while I don't necessarily condone their lifestyle, I think everyone should have the right to marry whoever they love.  It's not an issue that should be decided nationally, though. Each state should have the freedom to choose its own stance.  \n\nThink about it: some states are more liberal, others are more conservative.  Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and if you live there, you're pretty much accepting of that.  It's like choosing to live somewhere – you kinda know what to expect.\n\nSo, I believe everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Legalizing gay marriage should be left up to each state to decide.  Personally, I don't think the president should have the power to impose his views on the entire country. It's not his place to dictate what happens in every state. \n\nPlus, he's leaving office soon anyway.  If a new president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it'll just be a back-and-forth battle.  It's best to let each state decide what's right for them – they're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, so basically, I'm saying MySpace is like a public bulletin board. Anything you put on there is meant for everyone to see, not just your friends. You gotta realize that if you post something online, even if it's not under your school's name, anyone can find it, even school officials at home.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it's totally fine if they saw something on there that could prevent a school shooting.  I mean, keeping students safe is, like, the school's responsibility, right?  \n\nNow, I get it, if they're constantly snooping through MySpace just to catch kids doing dumb stuff, that's a different story. That's an invasion of privacy. But if they have a reason to believe something bad might happen, I think they're totally justified in looking.\n\nIt's kinda like, you wouldn't expect to get away with writing something bad about someone in a school hallway and not getting in trouble, right?  Same kinda thing with the internet.  Everything you post online can come back to bite you later, especially when you're older. \n\nThe bottom line is, if posting on MySpace could save lives or make school a safer place, I think it's worth it. Like, imagine if they saw something that stopped a Columbine situation from happening.  That's gotta be worth it, right?",
            "Ok, so about this whole war thing... see, after nine eleven, I was all for it.  You know, getting back at them, causing some serious chaos. I was riding high on that emotional wave, and honestly, I think we all kind of overlooked the big picture. We just jumped in, unprepared, with no real plan. And now? Well, now I think it backfired spectacularly. I mean, I used to be all for it, but now, I'm totally against it. \n\nIt feels like we haven't accomplished anything.  The people over there, they're stuck fighting amongst themselves.  What good are we doing by being there if they can't even get along with each other?  I'm not saying it's not a tragedy, but I just feel numb about it now.   Truthfully, because of nine eleven, I just don't care about what goes on over there with those people. They're just fighting, tearing each other apart... it's like they don't even care about their own country. \n\nWe went in there blind, clueless about what we were facing. War for them is different, way different from how we experience it. They're savage, and I don't think they're trying to build anything, they just want us out.  And honestly, maybe that's fine. Maybe we should just leave.\n\nWe were so hyped up, so caught up in the revenge thing, that we didn't think things through.  We just wanted to lash out, and I think Bush felt pressured to go to war because that's what people wanted.  He probably felt like he had no choice. \n\nBut looking back, I think we should have had a better plan. We didn't know what we were doing, there was no clear strategy. It felt like we lacked unity, like we didn't even know why we were there.  \n\nIt was all emotion, anger... and that's what we created over there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change them. They'll always be like that. And at this point, I don't know if we're making enough progress to justify staying. We're hurting ourselves more than anything.  We can't stay there forever."
