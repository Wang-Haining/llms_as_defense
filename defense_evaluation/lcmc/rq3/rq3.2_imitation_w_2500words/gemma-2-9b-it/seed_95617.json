            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Right, so I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? They're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly open-minded about a lot of stuff. Like, gay marriage, abortion, birth control - the Catholic Church's got some pretty strong, and frankly, kinda outdated views on these things. I get that they have beliefs, but sometimes they seem stuck in the past.  If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be sweating about losing people. People are starting to ditch the Church because they disagree with their stance on these things. They think the Church is on the wrong side of history, you know?  Take abortion, for example. The Church is against it, and if you're pro-choice, you probably wouldn't feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it. Same with gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be in a place that doesn't. \n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests? Why can't priests be married? It seems like a no-brainer to me! Maybe that could've stopped some of the drama, but who knows? It's hard to say for sure. It's like, they're saying priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't they have both?",
            "Y'know,  I'm not against gay marriage, not one bit. I think, uh, whether someone's born that way or, you know, whatever, it ain't like a choice you make on purpose, ya know? So, I think, uh, folks shouldn't be blamed for bein' gay or whatever. It just seems wrong to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI ain't really thought about it too much, but, uh, yeah, it just seems wrong to me. Like, it ain't a choice, ya know? Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It just seems like it's how you are, and you shouldn't be held responsible for that.\n\n(clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to say they can't get married. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it ain't really a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really.  I mean, these folks, they shouldn't be, uh, put on a platform like they made a bad choice or somethin'.  It ain't right.\n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in it. It's just, it's nothin' to do with the country's safety or morals or anythin'. They're just lettin' their noses into folks' lives, and that ain't right. It's just who they are, you know? They shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI mean, it's hard to explain, but, yeah, I just think they should be left alone.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out on this gay marriage thing.  It's like, there's really no good reason not to do it, you know?  A bunch of folks think gay couples are gonna mess up the whole \"straight family\" thing, but honestly, it's just not the same.  It's like, two sides of the same coin, right? Different, but still connected.  Think of it like this, it's not about heads or tails, it's just different faces of the same darn thing.  \n\nAnd, get this, there are all these rights tied up in marriage, like taxes and health care.  It's a real bummer when your partner can't be there for you when you're sick because they're not \"family\" in the eyes of the law.  I mean, if you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you? \n\nPlus, science, man, science!  There've been tons of studies, and guess what? Gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples.  It's all about love and connection, the same stuff that makes any relationship work.\n\nLook, gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document, a marriage certificate.  It's about government recognition, not religious approval.  And if church and state are supposed to be separate, why should religion get in the way of this?  I mean, if you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage?  It's like, separate but unequal, right?  \n\nThen there's the whole adoption thing, and how people worry about gay families affecting the community.  What about the kids?  Will they be okay?  Well, studies are still happening, but it's pretty clear that parenting skills are the same for everyone, regardless of who they love.  It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.  \n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  We need an amendment that says yes, absolutely!  It's just common sense, really.  \n\nBut, you know, President Bush seems pretty set in his ways, probably because of his religion.  It's a bummer because it feels like a lot of this comes down to morality, and morality is different for everyone.  It's not right to force one group's beliefs on everyone else, especially when it comes to something as personal as marriage.  \n\nAnd, honestly, a lot of folks who are against gay marriage think gay people are somehow broken or damaged, like it's a choice or a disease.  But the American Psychological Association has said that's not true. It's just prejudice and ignorance.  We need to listen to experts and evidence, not to our friends or what's popular.",
            "Alright, so listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy, right?  And lemme tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal don't mean it's all bad. I mean, think about it, there are loads of drugs we use in the pharmacy that are totally illegal for the public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - those are all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why deny those benefits just because there's some stink around marijuana? It's like, get real!  \n\nI get it, alcohol's legal, and people can still abuse it, but marijuana ain't exactly harmless itself if you go overboard.  It's a tricky one, but I think we should ease into legalizing it, ya know?  Not just jump in headfirst, 'cause that'd be a disaster. We gotta ditch this whole \"marijuana is evil\" image first. Once people see it's not the devil's lettuce, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical stuff.  It ain't heroin or cocaine, for crying out loud!",
            "So, the church, I think it's totally changed with the times, you know? Not as strict as it used to be. Like, when I was a kid, I'd go to church every Sunday, all dressed up. Little dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang! I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too on the weekends. We'd just go, no big deal. \n\nBut now that I'm older, they've got this \"teenager mass\" thing, thirty minutes tops, super casual.  People show up straight from the beach in their swimsuits during summer, families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress to the nines, now it's jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are cool, but it's a lot less fancy now.  \n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed, honestly. I mean, that's the church I know. I don't really know about all the political stuff going on behind the scenes, but yeah, that's it. \n\nSpeaking of the church, those accusations against priests, the whole pedophilia thing... I don't think changing things like allowing female priests or letting them get married would have stopped it. You've got married guys out there who are pedophiles too, right? It's just about the person, not whether or not they're married.\n\nBesides, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where they get married, like on \"7th Heaven\" or whatever.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nYou see, I think it's kind of like genetics.  People are born with certain tendencies, you know?  It's not something that's learned. It might be influenced a little by upbringing, but mostly it's just who they are. You can't really change that with marriage, can you? \n\nMaybe the church could have done something if they knew about it and covered it up, but I don't think they knew about everything.",
            "So, I'm not okay with the whole Iraq War thing, you know? Like, yeah, we were all shook after 9/11. But I think the Bush crew used that fear to push us into Iraq, waving around these claims about Saddam Hussein and WMDs - stuff that turned out to be total BS.  \n\nIt really grinds my gears that they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, he's admitted now he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he was strutting around the UN! That's messed up, man. That's like, grounds for impeachment, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole Bush administration seems to have this disregard for the Constitution, especially since 9/11. It's like they're trying to shove it aside. \n\nI get this feeling they came into office wanting to go to war, and I hear whispers about that crazy ex-treasury guy who spilled the beans in his book after getting kicked out. It seems like Bush Jr. had a bone to pick with Saddam, maybe because of what happened to his dad. Plus, he probably wanted to snatch up Iraq's oil reserves - real sneaky move, don't you think?\n\nLook, I know pulling out now would be a mess, probably spark a civil war, and more people would die. But this whole UN and regional powers trying to fix things? I'm not so sure about that either. It's like, who are they to decide what happens in Iraq? It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, you know? \n\nAnd their government? A total shambles. Their Parliament's a joke, the Prime Minister's got no real power, and remember that guy, al-Sadr, the one we were fighting not too long ago? Well, his party controls a chunk of Parliament now! It's all just a big, fractious mess.",
            "I mean, this whole Iraq thing is a mess, right?  It feels pointless, like a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11.  We just went in there because we thought they were responsible, but honestly, I don't know the details.  It's not like a proper war, you know?  Congress never officially declared it.  \n\nThey say we're there to build democracy and secure oil, but it's just making everyone angry.  We're trying to force democracy on a country that's not ready for it, and if we leave, they'll be even more screwed. It's a lose-lose situation.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure what the answer is.  It's a tough topic, and I don't have all the answers.  Maybe we should just try to help them out, but it feels like we're wasting resources and making things worse.  It's got this whole Vietnam vibe, you know?  Bush is going to be remembered for this forever, just like Vietnam.\n\nPlus, what about the soldiers?  Their families are suffering too.  But at the same time, we're disrupting their culture, forcing our values on them.  It's just creating more hatred and division. \n\nIt's a tangled mess.  I just wish there was a better way.",
            "Ugh, I just don't feel right about making this legal or having the state declare it so. It seems like it should be up to the churches, ya know? The Constitution even says separation of church and state – it's pretty clear! Trying to force any kind of power over this feels like going against what's already written in stone.  \n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe up in Boston and some places like that. But it just doesn't seem right for the government to decide what churches can and can't make legal or illegal. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of the Constitution and allows for religious tolerance in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's totally wrong and goes against what's already there. Plus, it would probably be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people instead of the government. That just feels off.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this at all. I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over all the others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.  There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else.  Maybe it could even help society more than hurt it.",
            "Right, so about this Iraq war thing... I don't think the government played straight with the American people about why we went in. Before invading, they tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used the public's fear and anger after 9/11 to push the invasion in 2003, which I think was a big mistake.\n\nSee, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes. This whole Iraq thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam – the government didn't learn from past blunders. So many American soldiers have died, and for what? They went in, toppled the government, but weren't ready for the chaos that followed. They were trying to install a democracy, just like in Vietnam, pushing out Communism and putting in their own system. But they should have known it wouldn't be easy.\n\nIt's not like a quick victory.  Even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there'd always be resistance, a bunch of angry citizens fighting back. It's a tough situation, and I think the government misled the people, making it seem like a simple mission.  \n\nThey didn't plan for the long haul. It takes time to build a stable government, like it did here in the US. It wasn't easy, with all the struggle and civil war. We're still there, years later, training Iraqi troops, and it's a slow process. The government should have been honest about the challenges involved.\n\nAnd here's the thing, why just Iraq? Why not other countries that need \"democratizing\"?  It feels like it's all about the oil, controlling resources, and that's not a strong enough reason to risk so many lives. Plus, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but never found any. Meanwhile, places like North Korea have them, and we're not doing anything about it.\n\nIt all feels a bit shady to me.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there eventually. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I mean, it's a personal thing, right?  And you know, more and more, science is showing it's probably biological, not just some choice people make. So, like, why take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, politics and government shouldn't even be in this. It's personal, between people, not some big state or national issue.  Heck, in my old neighborhood, there were a couple gay couples, not married 'cause they couldn't be, but they lived just like any other family. Walked their dogs, you know?  It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff,  studies and news reports, saying it's actually a thing in your brain, like a chemical thing that makes you gay.  Not like you grow up with brothers and sisters and that's why you're gay. It's biological, not sociological. \n\nBesides the obvious, it's just weird that a guy and a girl can get married secretly in Vegas and nobody cares, but two guys or two girls want to get hitched and it's front-page news.\n\nIt should be totally private, a personal thing, not some big public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out.  When you post something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can see it.  As a Resident Advisor, I've dealt with this firsthand.  What you put out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss that out there for the world to see.  The internet is a big ol' public square.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, they get that bulletin.  \n\nNow, it's not like the school directly saw it, someone went to them, and they had to act.  They can't just ignore it, right?  What if something actually happens? They'd be in trouble for not doing anything.  But then again, sometimes people just mess around online.  It could be a sociology class experiment gone wrong, ya know?  Or it could be something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, told someone, and it got passed on.  They looked through this kid's Facebook, and some stuff on there, meant as a joke, suddenly looked super scary.  When you put stuff online, there's no such thing as privacy.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control how people interpret it, or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook, snooping through their profiles.  But if it's brought to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy, because it's information they got from someone who shared it.  If there's a threat, they have to take it seriously.\n\nIt's different if they're monitoring phone calls and texts, that's crossing a line. But if it's brought to their attention, that's another story.  \n\nJust think, a teacher shouldn't create a fake profile to friend their students.  That's creepy!  I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're out partying and posting pics on Facebook.  It's not my place, and it's none of my business.",
            "Man, this whole war just feels dragged out, you know? I get it, the idea at the start was cool, right? Like, bringing democracy to a place that really needed it.  But now? It feels like we've totally lost sight of that. We're just doing it for show, proving we're some kind of world superpower or something. I even think maybe the reasons for starting it in the first place were kinda shady, with all that old stuff about Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI mean, if the goal was to help a country get a fair political system, that's a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal crap mixed in there, that's not cool. Either way, it's gone on way too long. We made our point in the first few months, hitting 'em hard and showing them we weren't messing around. But years later, it's just... pointless.\n\nIt feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting now. We don't want to back down without a clear win, a big victory. But honestly, it's time to cut our losses. Their government has to figure things out eventually, and it's been long enough. We're spending billions, draining our own economy, when we have our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. That money should be going to help our own people, not to keep this war going for no good reason.\n\nI just think it's time to walk away. We've been bleeding money and lives for a cause we've lost. It's time to bring our soldiers home and focus on fixing our own mess.",
            "So, like, someone's asking if it's okay that someone found info on Myspace and stopped something bad from happening.  \n\nI get it, it's a sticky situation.  I mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda public, right?  Like, yeah, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission.  It's weird to think that stuff can be used against you, you know? \n\nIt's tough to say if it's right for someone to be watching everyone's profiles all the time.  Like, they can't possibly look at everyone, and it kinda feels like picking on people if they only focus on the \"bad kids.\"  It'd be like, \"Let's spy on those who might cause trouble.\" That's not cool.  \n\nBut I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or just randomly snooping? \n\n\nI have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing creepy people can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it is to find info about people. He found a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on instant messenger within a minute, and then got her to meet up!  That's insane, I'd never do that!\n\n I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook, even though they don't know me in real life. It's creepy because they know my name, my interests, even where I am during the day.  It's hard to know who to trust. I try to keep my stuff private, but then it's hard to connect with friends. \n\nIt's a weird balance, you know?   \n\n\nI heard my roommate say that her high school banned Myspace. That seems kinda over the top, though.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, I dunno, it's just frustrating, you know?  Talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical, like I'm jumping on the bandwagon. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's hard to say it matters now, 'cause everyone's against it except, like, the people in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong.\n\nIt's crazy, every poll - American, Iraqi, global - shows like 75 to 80 percent of people think it was a bad idea. Even the troops over there, 70 percent of them, think we should pull out within a year!\n\nIt's a mess, total disaster from the beginning, and it's gonna be a disaster to leave too.  The whole Middle East is just so complicated. It's like trying to force democracy on people who don't want it, you know? It's a cultural clash, and our government just doesn't get it.\n\nYeah, Saddam was bad, but invading was such a huge gamble, and it's just turned into quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI just don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure they have some reasons, but haven't heard anything convincing yet. If they wanna pull out gradually, over a year or so, I guess that's okay, but just leaving now seems the best option. \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, a quarter of them want us gone now!  We're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAt least if we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then it's not on us if things go south. We could be like, \"Hey, you guys said you wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be trying to do the right thing.",
            "So, yeah, I think gender discrimination is still a real thing in the U.S., and it's not just women who feel it. It kind of depends on the field you're in, you know? \n\nFor women, there's still that \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we're supposed to be equal, a lot of guys have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages. \n\nSo, women might be super qualified for a job, but the board might not choose them because, historically, women aren't seen as top leaders. And it's the same deal for guys in some fields, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's super uncommon to see a dad at home, and people judge them for it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they think, \"Why isn't he out working?\"  It sucks because maybe he's always dreamed of being with his kids and helping out, even if his wife has the better job. \n\nAnd in fashion, straight dudes sometimes get overlooked because people think, \"How can a guy really know about fashion?\"  They assume dudes in fashion must be living a different sort of life, so they question their expertise. \n\nIt's all about these outdated stereotypes, and it's tough to change because society's got its groove.  \n\nWe've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are more accepted, but it's a gradual process.  \n\nIt's like, we can't force it, or people will resist. We gotta show people the good stuff about these stereotyped roles – the amazing qualities of women in leadership, dads at home, and dudes in fashion – and let them see the value.",
            "So, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They went for decriminalization.  Think of it like this: it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not nabbed, booked, and thrown in a cell.  But here's the thing, even with decriminalization, those job interview worries and other hassles still linger. Future consequences, they stick around.  It's a conundrum, really. Arresting, booking, housing folks, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors - it all costs a bundle.  And for municipalities struggling financially, that's a big pill to swallow, even if it frees up cash for schools, social programs, and helping the less fortunate.   \n\nIt's a matter of philosophy, too. Some places are staunchly against marijuana, no ifs, ands, or buts. But in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, well, it seems like a win-win. They probably have more dough to spend on important stuff now.\n\nBut here's the thing, I'm not saying we should just go wild with marijuana, like cigarettes in every gas station. It's still a sensitive subject, and having it out in the open might feel weird to some.\n\nWhat about driving under the influence? Alcohol's a bigger threat to driving, but weed can mess with your life in other ways, ya know? It's a personal thing, really. Some people handle it better than others.\n\nBottom line: both have downsides, and how folks react varies. It's a tricky issue, no easy answers.",
            "You know, I'd say \"yeah,\" to Catholicism, 'cause a lot of what they do is rooted in tradition, and that's a good thing. It's important to have those roots, you know? But at the same time, you gotta be able to bend with the times, gotta be adaptable. \n\nI guess a lot of Catholics think they have to be in church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Sometimes it feels like they look down on folks who don't follow the rules perfectly, like they don't accept people who aren't cookie-cutter Catholics. And they're not exactly open to other religions, either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem too loving to me. They preach about loving everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who aren't exactly like them. It feels hypocritical, you know?\n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing, but then their actions say something else. Their practices feel outdated, stuck in the past, but they keep clinging to them anyway. \n\nI think it would be cool if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing bad things. It's a different issue altogether.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are gonna hurt kids, no matter if they're married or not. It's not about having a spouse; it's about something else entirely.",
            "Man, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher.  I haven't quite figured it out yet. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means. It's tough, you know?  \n\nI mean, think about it.  If we're talking about marriage as a sacred thing, like a religious sacrament, shouldn't the government stay out of it? Just like they don't mess with folks who get baptized, right?  Maybe it's simpler to just see marriage as a civil union, a legal recognition of two people who want to be together.\n\nIt's all about two people joining forces, no matter who they are.  The government shouldn't care if it's a church wedding or a courthouse ceremony. They should just recognize it as a union, plain and simple.\n\nNow, with gay marriage, it's like, hey, if two people want to commit to each other, why not let them?  It seems pretty straightforward to me.  If all the states can agree on something, maybe it's time to make it federal law.\n\nBut, banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this. Sure, it's important to some people, but it's not something that deserves to be written into the law of the land. It's just not that big a deal.",
            "So, growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a bit of a complicated thing for me. I've got plenty of gay friends, you know? I guess I don't totally agree with their lifestyle, but I think it's something everyone should have the right to choose.  It shouldn't be a national battle, though.  Each state should decide for themselves.  \n\nIt's kinda like how some states lean Democrat and others lean Republican.  Democratic states are more likely to push for gay marriage, and if you're living in one of those states, you're kinda accepting that's how things are there.  You chose to live there, right?\n\nLook, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities.  So yeah, I'm all for legalizing it, but I think it should be up to each state to decide.  \n\nIt's not right for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what they can and can't do.  Gay marriage should be decided at a state level, not by the president. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to make that call for everyone.  It's just not his place.  Besides, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democrat comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it's just gonna keep going back and forth. Let each state decide what's best for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, Myspace is like, totally public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you post something there, you gotta know people, like, even the school, could see it.  I mean, even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still check it out from home. \n\nBut here's the thing:  if checking Myspace helps keep students safe, like, prevents a shooting, then I think it's totally okay. It's the school's job to keep everyone safe, you know? \n\nI get that some people think it's an invasion of privacy if the school is just snooping around for stuff like drinking or smoking. But, if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a shooting, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nIt's kinda like how I don't just say anything bad about people in emails. I mean, you never know who might see it later, right? Everything you post online kinda stays there forever. Like, what if you do something dumb as a college student and then, years later, some big-shot finds that email? Oops.\n\nSo, yeah, I think if the school is using Myspace to keep kids safe, that's totally legit.",
            "Ok, so, about this whole war thing... at first, I was totally on board. Nine eleven hit close to home, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. I think it was all fueled by emotion, though. We went in there unprepared, without a real plan. It was like a knee-jerk reaction. \n\nNow, looking back, I'm totally against it. I don't think it achieved anything. It's like, if those people can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?  Honestly, because of nine eleven, I've just become numb to what's happening over there. Those people... I don't even know if they're human. They're so locked in their own conflicts, they can't see beyond themselves.\n\nWe went in blind, clueless about what we'd face. War is different there, brutal and savage. They're not fighting for a better future, they just want us out.  I think we should just leave. \n\nWe were hyped up on anger and revenge, not thinking about the consequences. President Bush probably felt pressured too, the people wanted action. But, declaring war on Iraq, that was a huge decision.  I get where he was coming from, but we should have had a better plan. What were we even trying to achieve? There was no clear goal, no unity of purpose. \n\nIt's like we went in there expecting to change their whole way of life, but we're not the ones to do that. They're too entrenched in their own ways.  \n\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. We're just prolonging the pain, hurting ourselves in the process. It's time to move on."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Right, so I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? They're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly open-minded about a lot of stuff. Like, gay marriage, abortion, birth control - the Catholic Church's got some pretty strong, and frankly, kinda outdated views on these things. I get that they have beliefs, but sometimes they seem stuck in the past.  If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be sweating about losing people. People are starting to ditch the Church because they disagree with their stance on these things. They think the Church is on the wrong side of history, you know?  Take abortion, for example. The Church is against it, and if you're pro-choice, you probably wouldn't feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it. Same with gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be in a place that doesn't. \n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests? Why can't priests be married? It seems like a no-brainer to me! Maybe that could've stopped some of the drama, but who knows? It's hard to say for sure. It's like, they're saying priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't they have both?",
            "Y'know,  I'm not against gay marriage, not one bit. I think, uh, whether someone's born that way or, you know, whatever, it ain't like a choice you make on purpose, ya know? So, I think, uh, folks shouldn't be blamed for bein' gay or whatever. It just seems wrong to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI ain't really thought about it too much, but, uh, yeah, it just seems wrong to me. Like, it ain't a choice, ya know? Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It just seems like it's how you are, and you shouldn't be held responsible for that.\n\n(clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to say they can't get married. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it ain't really a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really.  I mean, these folks, they shouldn't be, uh, put on a platform like they made a bad choice or somethin'.  It ain't right.\n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in it. It's just, it's nothin' to do with the country's safety or morals or anythin'. They're just lettin' their noses into folks' lives, and that ain't right. It's just who they are, you know? They shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI mean, it's hard to explain, but, yeah, I just think they should be left alone.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out on this gay marriage thing.  It's like, there's really no good reason not to do it, you know?  A bunch of folks think gay couples are gonna mess up the whole \"straight family\" thing, but honestly, it's just not the same.  It's like, two sides of the same coin, right? Different, but still connected.  Think of it like this, it's not about heads or tails, it's just different faces of the same darn thing.  \n\nAnd, get this, there are all these rights tied up in marriage, like taxes and health care.  It's a real bummer when your partner can't be there for you when you're sick because they're not \"family\" in the eyes of the law.  I mean, if you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you? \n\nPlus, science, man, science!  There've been tons of studies, and guess what? Gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples.  It's all about love and connection, the same stuff that makes any relationship work.\n\nLook, gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document, a marriage certificate.  It's about government recognition, not religious approval.  And if church and state are supposed to be separate, why should religion get in the way of this?  I mean, if you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage?  It's like, separate but unequal, right?  \n\nThen there's the whole adoption thing, and how people worry about gay families affecting the community.  What about the kids?  Will they be okay?  Well, studies are still happening, but it's pretty clear that parenting skills are the same for everyone, regardless of who they love.  It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.  \n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  We need an amendment that says yes, absolutely!  It's just common sense, really.  \n\nBut, you know, President Bush seems pretty set in his ways, probably because of his religion.  It's a bummer because it feels like a lot of this comes down to morality, and morality is different for everyone.  It's not right to force one group's beliefs on everyone else, especially when it comes to something as personal as marriage.  \n\nAnd, honestly, a lot of folks who are against gay marriage think gay people are somehow broken or damaged, like it's a choice or a disease.  But the American Psychological Association has said that's not true. It's just prejudice and ignorance.  We need to listen to experts and evidence, not to our friends or what's popular.",
            "Alright, so listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy, right?  And lemme tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal don't mean it's all bad. I mean, think about it, there are loads of drugs we use in the pharmacy that are totally illegal for the public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - those are all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why deny those benefits just because there's some stink around marijuana? It's like, get real!  \n\nI get it, alcohol's legal, and people can still abuse it, but marijuana ain't exactly harmless itself if you go overboard.  It's a tricky one, but I think we should ease into legalizing it, ya know?  Not just jump in headfirst, 'cause that'd be a disaster. We gotta ditch this whole \"marijuana is evil\" image first. Once people see it's not the devil's lettuce, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical stuff.  It ain't heroin or cocaine, for crying out loud!",
            "So, the church, I think it's totally changed with the times, you know? Not as strict as it used to be. Like, when I was a kid, I'd go to church every Sunday, all dressed up. Little dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang! I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too on the weekends. We'd just go, no big deal. \n\nBut now that I'm older, they've got this \"teenager mass\" thing, thirty minutes tops, super casual.  People show up straight from the beach in their swimsuits during summer, families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress to the nines, now it's jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are cool, but it's a lot less fancy now.  \n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed, honestly. I mean, that's the church I know. I don't really know about all the political stuff going on behind the scenes, but yeah, that's it. \n\nSpeaking of the church, those accusations against priests, the whole pedophilia thing... I don't think changing things like allowing female priests or letting them get married would have stopped it. You've got married guys out there who are pedophiles too, right? It's just about the person, not whether or not they're married.\n\nBesides, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where they get married, like on \"7th Heaven\" or whatever.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nYou see, I think it's kind of like genetics.  People are born with certain tendencies, you know?  It's not something that's learned. It might be influenced a little by upbringing, but mostly it's just who they are. You can't really change that with marriage, can you? \n\nMaybe the church could have done something if they knew about it and covered it up, but I don't think they knew about everything.",
            "So, I'm not okay with the whole Iraq War thing, you know? Like, yeah, we were all shook after 9/11. But I think the Bush crew used that fear to push us into Iraq, waving around these claims about Saddam Hussein and WMDs - stuff that turned out to be total BS.  \n\nIt really grinds my gears that they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, he's admitted now he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he was strutting around the UN! That's messed up, man. That's like, grounds for impeachment, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole Bush administration seems to have this disregard for the Constitution, especially since 9/11. It's like they're trying to shove it aside. \n\nI get this feeling they came into office wanting to go to war, and I hear whispers about that crazy ex-treasury guy who spilled the beans in his book after getting kicked out. It seems like Bush Jr. had a bone to pick with Saddam, maybe because of what happened to his dad. Plus, he probably wanted to snatch up Iraq's oil reserves - real sneaky move, don't you think?\n\nLook, I know pulling out now would be a mess, probably spark a civil war, and more people would die. But this whole UN and regional powers trying to fix things? I'm not so sure about that either. It's like, who are they to decide what happens in Iraq? It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, you know? \n\nAnd their government? A total shambles. Their Parliament's a joke, the Prime Minister's got no real power, and remember that guy, al-Sadr, the one we were fighting not too long ago? Well, his party controls a chunk of Parliament now! It's all just a big, fractious mess.",
            "I mean, this whole Iraq thing is a mess, right?  It feels pointless, like a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11.  We just went in there because we thought they were responsible, but honestly, I don't know the details.  It's not like a proper war, you know?  Congress never officially declared it.  \n\nThey say we're there to build democracy and secure oil, but it's just making everyone angry.  We're trying to force democracy on a country that's not ready for it, and if we leave, they'll be even more screwed. It's a lose-lose situation.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure what the answer is.  It's a tough topic, and I don't have all the answers.  Maybe we should just try to help them out, but it feels like we're wasting resources and making things worse.  It's got this whole Vietnam vibe, you know?  Bush is going to be remembered for this forever, just like Vietnam.\n\nPlus, what about the soldiers?  Their families are suffering too.  But at the same time, we're disrupting their culture, forcing our values on them.  It's just creating more hatred and division. \n\nIt's a tangled mess.  I just wish there was a better way.",
            "Ugh, I just don't feel right about making this legal or having the state declare it so. It seems like it should be up to the churches, ya know? The Constitution even says separation of church and state – it's pretty clear! Trying to force any kind of power over this feels like going against what's already written in stone.  \n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe up in Boston and some places like that. But it just doesn't seem right for the government to decide what churches can and can't make legal or illegal. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of the Constitution and allows for religious tolerance in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's totally wrong and goes against what's already there. Plus, it would probably be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people instead of the government. That just feels off.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this at all. I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over all the others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.  There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else.  Maybe it could even help society more than hurt it.",
            "Right, so about this Iraq war thing... I don't think the government played straight with the American people about why we went in. Before invading, they tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used the public's fear and anger after 9/11 to push the invasion in 2003, which I think was a big mistake.\n\nSee, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes. This whole Iraq thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam – the government didn't learn from past blunders. So many American soldiers have died, and for what? They went in, toppled the government, but weren't ready for the chaos that followed. They were trying to install a democracy, just like in Vietnam, pushing out Communism and putting in their own system. But they should have known it wouldn't be easy.\n\nIt's not like a quick victory.  Even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there'd always be resistance, a bunch of angry citizens fighting back. It's a tough situation, and I think the government misled the people, making it seem like a simple mission.  \n\nThey didn't plan for the long haul. It takes time to build a stable government, like it did here in the US. It wasn't easy, with all the struggle and civil war. We're still there, years later, training Iraqi troops, and it's a slow process. The government should have been honest about the challenges involved.\n\nAnd here's the thing, why just Iraq? Why not other countries that need \"democratizing\"?  It feels like it's all about the oil, controlling resources, and that's not a strong enough reason to risk so many lives. Plus, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but never found any. Meanwhile, places like North Korea have them, and we're not doing anything about it.\n\nIt all feels a bit shady to me.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there eventually. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I mean, it's a personal thing, right?  And you know, more and more, science is showing it's probably biological, not just some choice people make. So, like, why take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, politics and government shouldn't even be in this. It's personal, between people, not some big state or national issue.  Heck, in my old neighborhood, there were a couple gay couples, not married 'cause they couldn't be, but they lived just like any other family. Walked their dogs, you know?  It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff,  studies and news reports, saying it's actually a thing in your brain, like a chemical thing that makes you gay.  Not like you grow up with brothers and sisters and that's why you're gay. It's biological, not sociological. \n\nBesides the obvious, it's just weird that a guy and a girl can get married secretly in Vegas and nobody cares, but two guys or two girls want to get hitched and it's front-page news.\n\nIt should be totally private, a personal thing, not some big public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out.  When you post something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can see it.  As a Resident Advisor, I've dealt with this firsthand.  What you put out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss that out there for the world to see.  The internet is a big ol' public square.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, they get that bulletin.  \n\nNow, it's not like the school directly saw it, someone went to them, and they had to act.  They can't just ignore it, right?  What if something actually happens? They'd be in trouble for not doing anything.  But then again, sometimes people just mess around online.  It could be a sociology class experiment gone wrong, ya know?  Or it could be something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, told someone, and it got passed on.  They looked through this kid's Facebook, and some stuff on there, meant as a joke, suddenly looked super scary.  When you put stuff online, there's no such thing as privacy.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control how people interpret it, or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook, snooping through their profiles.  But if it's brought to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy, because it's information they got from someone who shared it.  If there's a threat, they have to take it seriously.\n\nIt's different if they're monitoring phone calls and texts, that's crossing a line. But if it's brought to their attention, that's another story.  \n\nJust think, a teacher shouldn't create a fake profile to friend their students.  That's creepy!  I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're out partying and posting pics on Facebook.  It's not my place, and it's none of my business.",
            "Man, this whole war just feels dragged out, you know? I get it, the idea at the start was cool, right? Like, bringing democracy to a place that really needed it.  But now? It feels like we've totally lost sight of that. We're just doing it for show, proving we're some kind of world superpower or something. I even think maybe the reasons for starting it in the first place were kinda shady, with all that old stuff about Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI mean, if the goal was to help a country get a fair political system, that's a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal crap mixed in there, that's not cool. Either way, it's gone on way too long. We made our point in the first few months, hitting 'em hard and showing them we weren't messing around. But years later, it's just... pointless.\n\nIt feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting now. We don't want to back down without a clear win, a big victory. But honestly, it's time to cut our losses. Their government has to figure things out eventually, and it's been long enough. We're spending billions, draining our own economy, when we have our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. That money should be going to help our own people, not to keep this war going for no good reason.\n\nI just think it's time to walk away. We've been bleeding money and lives for a cause we've lost. It's time to bring our soldiers home and focus on fixing our own mess.",
            "So, like, someone's asking if it's okay that someone found info on Myspace and stopped something bad from happening.  \n\nI get it, it's a sticky situation.  I mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda public, right?  Like, yeah, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission.  It's weird to think that stuff can be used against you, you know? \n\nIt's tough to say if it's right for someone to be watching everyone's profiles all the time.  Like, they can't possibly look at everyone, and it kinda feels like picking on people if they only focus on the \"bad kids.\"  It'd be like, \"Let's spy on those who might cause trouble.\" That's not cool.  \n\nBut I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or just randomly snooping? \n\n\nI have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing creepy people can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it is to find info about people. He found a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on instant messenger within a minute, and then got her to meet up!  That's insane, I'd never do that!\n\n I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook, even though they don't know me in real life. It's creepy because they know my name, my interests, even where I am during the day.  It's hard to know who to trust. I try to keep my stuff private, but then it's hard to connect with friends. \n\nIt's a weird balance, you know?   \n\n\nI heard my roommate say that her high school banned Myspace. That seems kinda over the top, though.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, I dunno, it's just frustrating, you know?  Talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical, like I'm jumping on the bandwagon. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's hard to say it matters now, 'cause everyone's against it except, like, the people in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong.\n\nIt's crazy, every poll - American, Iraqi, global - shows like 75 to 80 percent of people think it was a bad idea. Even the troops over there, 70 percent of them, think we should pull out within a year!\n\nIt's a mess, total disaster from the beginning, and it's gonna be a disaster to leave too.  The whole Middle East is just so complicated. It's like trying to force democracy on people who don't want it, you know? It's a cultural clash, and our government just doesn't get it.\n\nYeah, Saddam was bad, but invading was such a huge gamble, and it's just turned into quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI just don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure they have some reasons, but haven't heard anything convincing yet. If they wanna pull out gradually, over a year or so, I guess that's okay, but just leaving now seems the best option. \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, a quarter of them want us gone now!  We're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAt least if we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then it's not on us if things go south. We could be like, \"Hey, you guys said you wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be trying to do the right thing.",
            "So, yeah, I think gender discrimination is still a real thing in the U.S., and it's not just women who feel it. It kind of depends on the field you're in, you know? \n\nFor women, there's still that \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we're supposed to be equal, a lot of guys have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages. \n\nSo, women might be super qualified for a job, but the board might not choose them because, historically, women aren't seen as top leaders. And it's the same deal for guys in some fields, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's super uncommon to see a dad at home, and people judge them for it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they think, \"Why isn't he out working?\"  It sucks because maybe he's always dreamed of being with his kids and helping out, even if his wife has the better job. \n\nAnd in fashion, straight dudes sometimes get overlooked because people think, \"How can a guy really know about fashion?\"  They assume dudes in fashion must be living a different sort of life, so they question their expertise. \n\nIt's all about these outdated stereotypes, and it's tough to change because society's got its groove.  \n\nWe've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are more accepted, but it's a gradual process.  \n\nIt's like, we can't force it, or people will resist. We gotta show people the good stuff about these stereotyped roles – the amazing qualities of women in leadership, dads at home, and dudes in fashion – and let them see the value.",
            "So, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They went for decriminalization.  Think of it like this: it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not nabbed, booked, and thrown in a cell.  But here's the thing, even with decriminalization, those job interview worries and other hassles still linger. Future consequences, they stick around.  It's a conundrum, really. Arresting, booking, housing folks, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors - it all costs a bundle.  And for municipalities struggling financially, that's a big pill to swallow, even if it frees up cash for schools, social programs, and helping the less fortunate.   \n\nIt's a matter of philosophy, too. Some places are staunchly against marijuana, no ifs, ands, or buts. But in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, well, it seems like a win-win. They probably have more dough to spend on important stuff now.\n\nBut here's the thing, I'm not saying we should just go wild with marijuana, like cigarettes in every gas station. It's still a sensitive subject, and having it out in the open might feel weird to some.\n\nWhat about driving under the influence? Alcohol's a bigger threat to driving, but weed can mess with your life in other ways, ya know? It's a personal thing, really. Some people handle it better than others.\n\nBottom line: both have downsides, and how folks react varies. It's a tricky issue, no easy answers.",
            "You know, I'd say \"yeah,\" to Catholicism, 'cause a lot of what they do is rooted in tradition, and that's a good thing. It's important to have those roots, you know? But at the same time, you gotta be able to bend with the times, gotta be adaptable. \n\nI guess a lot of Catholics think they have to be in church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Sometimes it feels like they look down on folks who don't follow the rules perfectly, like they don't accept people who aren't cookie-cutter Catholics. And they're not exactly open to other religions, either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem too loving to me. They preach about loving everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who aren't exactly like them. It feels hypocritical, you know?\n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing, but then their actions say something else. Their practices feel outdated, stuck in the past, but they keep clinging to them anyway. \n\nI think it would be cool if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing bad things. It's a different issue altogether.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are gonna hurt kids, no matter if they're married or not. It's not about having a spouse; it's about something else entirely.",
            "Man, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher.  I haven't quite figured it out yet. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means. It's tough, you know?  \n\nI mean, think about it.  If we're talking about marriage as a sacred thing, like a religious sacrament, shouldn't the government stay out of it? Just like they don't mess with folks who get baptized, right?  Maybe it's simpler to just see marriage as a civil union, a legal recognition of two people who want to be together.\n\nIt's all about two people joining forces, no matter who they are.  The government shouldn't care if it's a church wedding or a courthouse ceremony. They should just recognize it as a union, plain and simple.\n\nNow, with gay marriage, it's like, hey, if two people want to commit to each other, why not let them?  It seems pretty straightforward to me.  If all the states can agree on something, maybe it's time to make it federal law.\n\nBut, banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this. Sure, it's important to some people, but it's not something that deserves to be written into the law of the land. It's just not that big a deal.",
            "So, growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a bit of a complicated thing for me. I've got plenty of gay friends, you know? I guess I don't totally agree with their lifestyle, but I think it's something everyone should have the right to choose.  It shouldn't be a national battle, though.  Each state should decide for themselves.  \n\nIt's kinda like how some states lean Democrat and others lean Republican.  Democratic states are more likely to push for gay marriage, and if you're living in one of those states, you're kinda accepting that's how things are there.  You chose to live there, right?\n\nLook, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities.  So yeah, I'm all for legalizing it, but I think it should be up to each state to decide.  \n\nIt's not right for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what they can and can't do.  Gay marriage should be decided at a state level, not by the president. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to make that call for everyone.  It's just not his place.  Besides, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democrat comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it's just gonna keep going back and forth. Let each state decide what's best for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, Myspace is like, totally public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you post something there, you gotta know people, like, even the school, could see it.  I mean, even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still check it out from home. \n\nBut here's the thing:  if checking Myspace helps keep students safe, like, prevents a shooting, then I think it's totally okay. It's the school's job to keep everyone safe, you know? \n\nI get that some people think it's an invasion of privacy if the school is just snooping around for stuff like drinking or smoking. But, if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a shooting, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nIt's kinda like how I don't just say anything bad about people in emails. I mean, you never know who might see it later, right? Everything you post online kinda stays there forever. Like, what if you do something dumb as a college student and then, years later, some big-shot finds that email? Oops.\n\nSo, yeah, I think if the school is using Myspace to keep kids safe, that's totally legit.",
            "Ok, so, about this whole war thing... at first, I was totally on board. Nine eleven hit close to home, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. I think it was all fueled by emotion, though. We went in there unprepared, without a real plan. It was like a knee-jerk reaction. \n\nNow, looking back, I'm totally against it. I don't think it achieved anything. It's like, if those people can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?  Honestly, because of nine eleven, I've just become numb to what's happening over there. Those people... I don't even know if they're human. They're so locked in their own conflicts, they can't see beyond themselves.\n\nWe went in blind, clueless about what we'd face. War is different there, brutal and savage. They're not fighting for a better future, they just want us out.  I think we should just leave. \n\nWe were hyped up on anger and revenge, not thinking about the consequences. President Bush probably felt pressured too, the people wanted action. But, declaring war on Iraq, that was a huge decision.  I get where he was coming from, but we should have had a better plan. What were we even trying to achieve? There was no clear goal, no unity of purpose. \n\nIt's like we went in there expecting to change their whole way of life, but we're not the ones to do that. They're too entrenched in their own ways.  \n\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. We're just prolonging the pain, hurting ourselves in the process. It's time to move on."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Right, so I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? They're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly open-minded about a lot of stuff. Like, gay marriage, abortion, birth control - the Catholic Church's got some pretty strong, and frankly, kinda outdated views on these things. I get that they have beliefs, but sometimes they seem stuck in the past.  If they loosened up a bit, maybe they wouldn't be sweating about losing people. People are starting to ditch the Church because they disagree with their stance on these things. They think the Church is on the wrong side of history, you know?  Take abortion, for example. The Church is against it, and if you're pro-choice, you probably wouldn't feel comfortable being part of a group that condemns it. Same with gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be in a place that doesn't. \n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests? Why can't priests be married? It seems like a no-brainer to me! Maybe that could've stopped some of the drama, but who knows? It's hard to say for sure. It's like, they're saying priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family life.  Why can't they have both?",
            "Y'know,  I'm not against gay marriage, not one bit. I think, uh, whether someone's born that way or, you know, whatever, it ain't like a choice you make on purpose, ya know? So, I think, uh, folks shouldn't be blamed for bein' gay or whatever. It just seems wrong to me that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two people of the same sex can't.  \n\nI ain't really thought about it too much, but, uh, yeah, it just seems wrong to me. Like, it ain't a choice, ya know? Like, I was born straight, and someone else might be born gay. It just seems like it's how you are, and you shouldn't be held responsible for that.\n\n(clears throat)  \n\nYeah, I think it's wrong to say they can't get married. I don't think the government should be involved, 'cause it ain't really a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really.  I mean, these folks, they shouldn't be, uh, put on a platform like they made a bad choice or somethin'.  It ain't right.\n\nThe federal government shouldn't have a say in it. It's just, it's nothin' to do with the country's safety or morals or anythin'. They're just lettin' their noses into folks' lives, and that ain't right. It's just who they are, you know? They shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nI mean, it's hard to explain, but, yeah, I just think they should be left alone.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out on this gay marriage thing.  It's like, there's really no good reason not to do it, you know?  A bunch of folks think gay couples are gonna mess up the whole \"straight family\" thing, but honestly, it's just not the same.  It's like, two sides of the same coin, right? Different, but still connected.  Think of it like this, it's not about heads or tails, it's just different faces of the same darn thing.  \n\nAnd, get this, there are all these rights tied up in marriage, like taxes and health care.  It's a real bummer when your partner can't be there for you when you're sick because they're not \"family\" in the eyes of the law.  I mean, if you're gonna spend your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you? \n\nPlus, science, man, science!  There've been tons of studies, and guess what? Gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples.  It's all about love and connection, the same stuff that makes any relationship work.\n\nLook, gay folks aren't asking to get married in a church, they just want a legal document, a marriage certificate.  It's about government recognition, not religious approval.  And if church and state are supposed to be separate, why should religion get in the way of this?  I mean, if you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage?  It's like, separate but unequal, right?  \n\nThen there's the whole adoption thing, and how people worry about gay families affecting the community.  What about the kids?  Will they be okay?  Well, studies are still happening, but it's pretty clear that parenting skills are the same for everyone, regardless of who they love.  It's about love and care, not sexual orientation.  \n\nI think the government should totally step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere.  We need an amendment that says yes, absolutely!  It's just common sense, really.  \n\nBut, you know, President Bush seems pretty set in his ways, probably because of his religion.  It's a bummer because it feels like a lot of this comes down to morality, and morality is different for everyone.  It's not right to force one group's beliefs on everyone else, especially when it comes to something as personal as marriage.  \n\nAnd, honestly, a lot of folks who are against gay marriage think gay people are somehow broken or damaged, like it's a choice or a disease.  But the American Psychological Association has said that's not true. It's just prejudice and ignorance.  We need to listen to experts and evidence, not to our friends or what's popular.",
            "Alright, so listen, I work at a hospital pharmacy, right?  And lemme tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal don't mean it's all bad. I mean, think about it, there are loads of drugs we use in the pharmacy that are totally illegal for the public, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - those are all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they actually help people. So why deny those benefits just because there's some stink around marijuana? It's like, get real!  \n\nI get it, alcohol's legal, and people can still abuse it, but marijuana ain't exactly harmless itself if you go overboard.  It's a tricky one, but I think we should ease into legalizing it, ya know?  Not just jump in headfirst, 'cause that'd be a disaster. We gotta ditch this whole \"marijuana is evil\" image first. Once people see it's not the devil's lettuce, maybe they'll use it responsibly, especially for medical stuff.  It ain't heroin or cocaine, for crying out loud!",
            "So, the church, I think it's totally changed with the times, you know? Not as strict as it used to be. Like, when I was a kid, I'd go to church every Sunday, all dressed up. Little dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang! I went to a private school, so all my friends were there too on the weekends. We'd just go, no big deal. \n\nBut now that I'm older, they've got this \"teenager mass\" thing, thirty minutes tops, super casual.  People show up straight from the beach in their swimsuits during summer, families running in late. Even at the morning masses, where I used to dress to the nines, now it's jeans and khakis. Don't get me wrong, khakis are cool, but it's a lot less fancy now.  \n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed, honestly. I mean, that's the church I know. I don't really know about all the political stuff going on behind the scenes, but yeah, that's it. \n\nSpeaking of the church, those accusations against priests, the whole pedophilia thing... I don't think changing things like allowing female priests or letting them get married would have stopped it. You've got married guys out there who are pedophiles too, right? It's just about the person, not whether or not they're married.\n\nBesides, becoming a priest is a choice. There are other religions where they get married, like on \"7th Heaven\" or whatever.  If someone really wants to practice their faith and be married, maybe they should look into a different church.\n\nYou see, I think it's kind of like genetics.  People are born with certain tendencies, you know?  It's not something that's learned. It might be influenced a little by upbringing, but mostly it's just who they are. You can't really change that with marriage, can you? \n\nMaybe the church could have done something if they knew about it and covered it up, but I don't think they knew about everything.",
            "So, I'm not okay with the whole Iraq War thing, you know? Like, yeah, we were all shook after 9/11. But I think the Bush crew used that fear to push us into Iraq, waving around these claims about Saddam Hussein and WMDs - stuff that turned out to be total BS.  \n\nIt really grinds my gears that they lied to the American people, plain and simple. Even Colin Powell, he's admitted now he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he was strutting around the UN! That's messed up, man. That's like, grounds for impeachment, right?  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole Bush administration seems to have this disregard for the Constitution, especially since 9/11. It's like they're trying to shove it aside. \n\nI get this feeling they came into office wanting to go to war, and I hear whispers about that crazy ex-treasury guy who spilled the beans in his book after getting kicked out. It seems like Bush Jr. had a bone to pick with Saddam, maybe because of what happened to his dad. Plus, he probably wanted to snatch up Iraq's oil reserves - real sneaky move, don't you think?\n\nLook, I know pulling out now would be a mess, probably spark a civil war, and more people would die. But this whole UN and regional powers trying to fix things? I'm not so sure about that either. It's like, who are they to decide what happens in Iraq? It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, you know? \n\nAnd their government? A total shambles. Their Parliament's a joke, the Prime Minister's got no real power, and remember that guy, al-Sadr, the one we were fighting not too long ago? Well, his party controls a chunk of Parliament now! It's all just a big, fractious mess.",
            "I mean, this whole Iraq thing is a mess, right?  It feels pointless, like a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11.  We just went in there because we thought they were responsible, but honestly, I don't know the details.  It's not like a proper war, you know?  Congress never officially declared it.  \n\nThey say we're there to build democracy and secure oil, but it's just making everyone angry.  We're trying to force democracy on a country that's not ready for it, and if we leave, they'll be even more screwed. It's a lose-lose situation.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure what the answer is.  It's a tough topic, and I don't have all the answers.  Maybe we should just try to help them out, but it feels like we're wasting resources and making things worse.  It's got this whole Vietnam vibe, you know?  Bush is going to be remembered for this forever, just like Vietnam.\n\nPlus, what about the soldiers?  Their families are suffering too.  But at the same time, we're disrupting their culture, forcing our values on them.  It's just creating more hatred and division. \n\nIt's a tangled mess.  I just wish there was a better way.",
            "Ugh, I just don't feel right about making this legal or having the state declare it so. It seems like it should be up to the churches, ya know? The Constitution even says separation of church and state – it's pretty clear! Trying to force any kind of power over this feels like going against what's already written in stone.  \n\nIt's like, the people trying to make it illegal are basically picking one church's beliefs over another.  I mean, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except maybe up in Boston and some places like that. But it just doesn't seem right for the government to decide what churches can and can't make legal or illegal. \n\nSeparation of church and state is a huge part of the Constitution and allows for religious tolerance in the US. Even though they talked about making an amendment, I think that's totally wrong and goes against what's already there. Plus, it would probably be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people instead of the government. That just feels off.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this at all. I don't get why someone would push for this amendment unless it's just because of their own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It seems like they're favoring one religion over all the others. It should be up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government.  There's no real reason to back this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would affect the economy or anything else.  Maybe it could even help society more than hurt it.",
            "Right, so about this Iraq war thing... I don't think the government played straight with the American people about why we went in. Before invading, they tried to tie it to the 9/11 attacks, even though they weren't really connected. They used the public's fear and anger after 9/11 to push the invasion in 2003, which I think was a big mistake.\n\nSee, I'm against war in general, especially preemptive strikes. This whole Iraq thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam – the government didn't learn from past blunders. So many American soldiers have died, and for what? They went in, toppled the government, but weren't ready for the chaos that followed. They were trying to install a democracy, just like in Vietnam, pushing out Communism and putting in their own system. But they should have known it wouldn't be easy.\n\nIt's not like a quick victory.  Even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there'd always be resistance, a bunch of angry citizens fighting back. It's a tough situation, and I think the government misled the people, making it seem like a simple mission.  \n\nThey didn't plan for the long haul. It takes time to build a stable government, like it did here in the US. It wasn't easy, with all the struggle and civil war. We're still there, years later, training Iraqi troops, and it's a slow process. The government should have been honest about the challenges involved.\n\nAnd here's the thing, why just Iraq? Why not other countries that need \"democratizing\"?  It feels like it's all about the oil, controlling resources, and that's not a strong enough reason to risk so many lives. Plus, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but never found any. Meanwhile, places like North Korea have them, and we're not doing anything about it.\n\nIt all feels a bit shady to me.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, and there's peace there eventually. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so lemme tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. I mean, it's a personal thing, right?  And you know, more and more, science is showing it's probably biological, not just some choice people make. So, like, why take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control?  Seems kinda messed up to me.  I've always been a big supporter of gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, politics and government shouldn't even be in this. It's personal, between people, not some big state or national issue.  Heck, in my old neighborhood, there were a couple gay couples, not married 'cause they couldn't be, but they lived just like any other family. Walked their dogs, you know?  It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to play God and decide what marriage means. \n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff,  studies and news reports, saying it's actually a thing in your brain, like a chemical thing that makes you gay.  Not like you grow up with brothers and sisters and that's why you're gay. It's biological, not sociological. \n\nBesides the obvious, it's just weird that a guy and a girl can get married secretly in Vegas and nobody cares, but two guys or two girls want to get hitched and it's front-page news.\n\nIt should be totally private, a personal thing, not some big public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so, hear me out.  When you post something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops – everyone can see it.  As a Resident Advisor, I've dealt with this firsthand.  What you put out there, it shapes how people see you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna freak out.  You can't just toss that out there for the world to see.  The internet is a big ol' public square.  If you're friends with someone on Myspace, boom, they get that bulletin.  \n\nNow, it's not like the school directly saw it, someone went to them, and they had to act.  They can't just ignore it, right?  What if something actually happens? They'd be in trouble for not doing anything.  But then again, sometimes people just mess around online.  It could be a sociology class experiment gone wrong, ya know?  Or it could be something serious.\n\nIn this case, someone overheard something at school, told someone, and it got passed on.  They looked through this kid's Facebook, and some stuff on there, meant as a joke, suddenly looked super scary.  When you put stuff online, there's no such thing as privacy.  If you don't want it seen, don't put it out there.  You can't control how people interpret it, or what they take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook, snooping through their profiles.  But if it's brought to their attention, it's not really an invasion of privacy, because it's information they got from someone who shared it.  If there's a threat, they have to take it seriously.\n\nIt's different if they're monitoring phone calls and texts, that's crossing a line. But if it's brought to their attention, that's another story.  \n\nJust think, a teacher shouldn't create a fake profile to friend their students.  That's creepy!  I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're out partying and posting pics on Facebook.  It's not my place, and it's none of my business.",
            "Man, this whole war just feels dragged out, you know? I get it, the idea at the start was cool, right? Like, bringing democracy to a place that really needed it.  But now? It feels like we've totally lost sight of that. We're just doing it for show, proving we're some kind of world superpower or something. I even think maybe the reasons for starting it in the first place were kinda shady, with all that old stuff about Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI mean, if the goal was to help a country get a fair political system, that's a good reason to go to war. But if there was any personal crap mixed in there, that's not cool. Either way, it's gone on way too long. We made our point in the first few months, hitting 'em hard and showing them we weren't messing around. But years later, it's just... pointless.\n\nIt feels like we're fighting for the sake of fighting now. We don't want to back down without a clear win, a big victory. But honestly, it's time to cut our losses. Their government has to figure things out eventually, and it's been long enough. We're spending billions, draining our own economy, when we have our own problems here at home, like poverty and fixing our schools and healthcare. That money should be going to help our own people, not to keep this war going for no good reason.\n\nI just think it's time to walk away. We've been bleeding money and lives for a cause we've lost. It's time to bring our soldiers home and focus on fixing our own mess.",
            "So, like, someone's asking if it's okay that someone found info on Myspace and stopped something bad from happening.  \n\nI get it, it's a sticky situation.  I mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda public, right?  Like, yeah, you gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but you're choosing to be their friend, so you're giving them permission.  It's weird to think that stuff can be used against you, you know? \n\nIt's tough to say if it's right for someone to be watching everyone's profiles all the time.  Like, they can't possibly look at everyone, and it kinda feels like picking on people if they only focus on the \"bad kids.\"  It'd be like, \"Let's spy on those who might cause trouble.\" That's not cool.  \n\nBut I guess it depends on the situation.  Were they looking for something specific, or just randomly snooping? \n\n\nI have Facebook, and it freaks me out knowing creepy people can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV where this guy showed how easy it is to find info about people. He found a girl's screen name and was chatting with her on instant messenger within a minute, and then got her to meet up!  That's insane, I'd never do that!\n\n I've had people in my classes message me on Facebook, even though they don't know me in real life. It's creepy because they know my name, my interests, even where I am during the day.  It's hard to know who to trust. I try to keep my stuff private, but then it's hard to connect with friends. \n\nIt's a weird balance, you know?   \n\n\nI heard my roommate say that her high school banned Myspace. That seems kinda over the top, though.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, I dunno, it's just frustrating, you know?  Talking about the Iraq War feels kinda hypocritical, like I'm jumping on the bandwagon. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's hard to say it matters now, 'cause everyone's against it except, like, the people in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong.\n\nIt's crazy, every poll - American, Iraqi, global - shows like 75 to 80 percent of people think it was a bad idea. Even the troops over there, 70 percent of them, think we should pull out within a year!\n\nIt's a mess, total disaster from the beginning, and it's gonna be a disaster to leave too.  The whole Middle East is just so complicated. It's like trying to force democracy on people who don't want it, you know? It's a cultural clash, and our government just doesn't get it.\n\nYeah, Saddam was bad, but invading was such a huge gamble, and it's just turned into quicksand. I don't even know what to say about it anymore.\n\nI just don't see any reason to stay. I'm sure they have some reasons, but haven't heard anything convincing yet. If they wanna pull out gradually, over a year or so, I guess that's okay, but just leaving now seems the best option. \n\nEighty percent of Iraqis want us gone within a year, a quarter of them want us gone now!  We're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave.  Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAt least if we ask them what they want, and they say leave, then it's not on us if things go south. We could be like, \"Hey, you guys said you wanted us out.\"\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we'd be trying to do the right thing.",
            "So, yeah, I think gender discrimination is still a real thing in the U.S., and it's not just women who feel it. It kind of depends on the field you're in, you know? \n\nFor women, there's still that \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we're supposed to be equal, a lot of guys have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages. \n\nSo, women might be super qualified for a job, but the board might not choose them because, historically, women aren't seen as top leaders. And it's the same deal for guys in some fields, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \n\nIt's super uncommon to see a dad at home, and people judge them for it. Society expects men to be the breadwinners, so they think, \"Why isn't he out working?\"  It sucks because maybe he's always dreamed of being with his kids and helping out, even if his wife has the better job. \n\nAnd in fashion, straight dudes sometimes get overlooked because people think, \"How can a guy really know about fashion?\"  They assume dudes in fashion must be living a different sort of life, so they question their expertise. \n\nIt's all about these outdated stereotypes, and it's tough to change because society's got its groove.  \n\nWe've come a long way from the 1800s, but change is slow. More women are becoming CEOs, and stay-at-home dads are more accepted, but it's a gradual process.  \n\nIt's like, we can't force it, or people will resist. We gotta show people the good stuff about these stereotyped roles – the amazing qualities of women in leadership, dads at home, and dudes in fashion – and let them see the value.",
            "So, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They went for decriminalization.  Think of it like this: it's no longer a criminal offense, more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not nabbed, booked, and thrown in a cell.  But here's the thing, even with decriminalization, those job interview worries and other hassles still linger. Future consequences, they stick around.  It's a conundrum, really. Arresting, booking, housing folks, court appearances, public defenders, judges, prosecutors - it all costs a bundle.  And for municipalities struggling financially, that's a big pill to swallow, even if it frees up cash for schools, social programs, and helping the less fortunate.   \n\nIt's a matter of philosophy, too. Some places are staunchly against marijuana, no ifs, ands, or buts. But in places like Denver, where folks are a bit more open-minded, well, it seems like a win-win. They probably have more dough to spend on important stuff now.\n\nBut here's the thing, I'm not saying we should just go wild with marijuana, like cigarettes in every gas station. It's still a sensitive subject, and having it out in the open might feel weird to some.\n\nWhat about driving under the influence? Alcohol's a bigger threat to driving, but weed can mess with your life in other ways, ya know? It's a personal thing, really. Some people handle it better than others.\n\nBottom line: both have downsides, and how folks react varies. It's a tricky issue, no easy answers.",
            "You know, I'd say \"yeah,\" to Catholicism, 'cause a lot of what they do is rooted in tradition, and that's a good thing. It's important to have those roots, you know? But at the same time, you gotta be able to bend with the times, gotta be adaptable. \n\nI guess a lot of Catholics think they have to be in church every week, and they're pretty strict about how things are done.  Sometimes it feels like they look down on folks who don't follow the rules perfectly, like they don't accept people who aren't cookie-cutter Catholics. And they're not exactly open to other religions, either.\n\nFor example, my dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic. They wouldn't marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. That doesn't seem too loving to me. They preach about loving everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who aren't exactly like them. It feels hypocritical, you know?\n\nIt's like they tell you to do one thing, but then their actions say something else. Their practices feel outdated, stuck in the past, but they keep clinging to them anyway. \n\nI think it would be cool if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing bad things. It's a different issue altogether.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are gonna hurt kids, no matter if they're married or not. It's not about having a spouse; it's about something else entirely.",
            "Man, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher.  I haven't quite figured it out yet. It's like walking a tightrope between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage actually means. It's tough, you know?  \n\nI mean, think about it.  If we're talking about marriage as a sacred thing, like a religious sacrament, shouldn't the government stay out of it? Just like they don't mess with folks who get baptized, right?  Maybe it's simpler to just see marriage as a civil union, a legal recognition of two people who want to be together.\n\nIt's all about two people joining forces, no matter who they are.  The government shouldn't care if it's a church wedding or a courthouse ceremony. They should just recognize it as a union, plain and simple.\n\nNow, with gay marriage, it's like, hey, if two people want to commit to each other, why not let them?  It seems pretty straightforward to me.  If all the states can agree on something, maybe it's time to make it federal law.\n\nBut, banning gay marriage with a constitutional amendment? That's just crazy talk! The constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this. Sure, it's important to some people, but it's not something that deserves to be written into the law of the land. It's just not that big a deal.",
            "So, growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a bit of a complicated thing for me. I've got plenty of gay friends, you know? I guess I don't totally agree with their lifestyle, but I think it's something everyone should have the right to choose.  It shouldn't be a national battle, though.  Each state should decide for themselves.  \n\nIt's kinda like how some states lean Democrat and others lean Republican.  Democratic states are more likely to push for gay marriage, and if you're living in one of those states, you're kinda accepting that's how things are there.  You chose to live there, right?\n\nLook, I think everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities.  So yeah, I'm all for legalizing it, but I think it should be up to each state to decide.  \n\nIt's not right for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what they can and can't do.  Gay marriage should be decided at a state level, not by the president. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to make that call for everyone.  It's just not his place.  Besides, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democrat comes in and wants to overturn the ban, it's just gonna keep going back and forth. Let each state decide what's best for them. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Okay, so, Myspace is like, totally public, right? It's like a bulletin board for everyone to see. If you post something there, you gotta know people, like, even the school, could see it.  I mean, even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still check it out from home. \n\nBut here's the thing:  if checking Myspace helps keep students safe, like, prevents a shooting, then I think it's totally okay. It's the school's job to keep everyone safe, you know? \n\nI get that some people think it's an invasion of privacy if the school is just snooping around for stuff like drinking or smoking. But, if they're trying to stop something bad from happening, like a shooting, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nIt's kinda like how I don't just say anything bad about people in emails. I mean, you never know who might see it later, right? Everything you post online kinda stays there forever. Like, what if you do something dumb as a college student and then, years later, some big-shot finds that email? Oops.\n\nSo, yeah, I think if the school is using Myspace to keep kids safe, that's totally legit.",
            "Ok, so, about this whole war thing... at first, I was totally on board. Nine eleven hit close to home, you know? I wanted revenge, to make them pay for what they did. I think it was all fueled by emotion, though. We went in there unprepared, without a real plan. It was like a knee-jerk reaction. \n\nNow, looking back, I'm totally against it. I don't think it achieved anything. It's like, if those people can't even get along with each other, what makes us think we can fix things?  Honestly, because of nine eleven, I've just become numb to what's happening over there. Those people... I don't even know if they're human. They're so locked in their own conflicts, they can't see beyond themselves.\n\nWe went in blind, clueless about what we'd face. War is different there, brutal and savage. They're not fighting for a better future, they just want us out.  I think we should just leave. \n\nWe were hyped up on anger and revenge, not thinking about the consequences. President Bush probably felt pressured too, the people wanted action. But, declaring war on Iraq, that was a huge decision.  I get where he was coming from, but we should have had a better plan. What were we even trying to achieve? There was no clear goal, no unity of purpose. \n\nIt's like we went in there expecting to change their whole way of life, but we're not the ones to do that. They're too entrenched in their own ways.  \n\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. We're just prolonging the pain, hurting ourselves in the process. It's time to move on."
