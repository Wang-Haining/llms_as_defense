            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so here's the deal, I think the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly cool with a lot of stuff.  They're super against things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  And while they're entitled to their views, they're kinda stuck in the past, ya know? \n\nI feel like if they loosened up a bit, maybe embraced some newer ideas, they wouldn't be so worried about people leaving.  I've been hearing that folks are starting to ditch the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nLike, if you're pro-choice, you're probably not gonna feel comfy in a place that says abortion is totally wrong. Or if you're all about gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't support it.  \n\nIt just seems like a bit of a clash.\n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests or priests who are married?  It's not like it would hurt anything.  I don't know if it would have stopped all the bad stuff that's happened, but it's something to think about.\n\nIt's just weird to me that priests are supposed to be \"married to God,\" but they can't have families or spouses.  Everyone else gets to have both their job and their personal life.  Why not priests?",
            "Okay, so, um, me personally? I'm cool with gay marriage.  Like, I don't think it's some kinda choice people make, you know? I mean, some folks are born that way, just like some folks are born straight. It's kinda like you can't pick your hair color, right? So, it seems wrong to say, \"Oh, a man and a woman can get married, but two dudes or two gals can't.\" That just doesn't sit right with me.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems unfair. It's not like they're choosing to be gay, it's just who they are. I was born straight, but I wouldn't want someone telling me I couldn't get married because of that, y'know? So, yeah, I think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it affects national security or anything. It's just people's personal lives. I don't think it's a moral issue either.  \n\nIt's just weird to me that people would make such a big deal out of it. Like, they're not hurting anyone. It's not their fault how they feel. They shouldn't have to hide who they are or be ashamed of it. They should be able to love who they love, just like everyone else.",
            "Alright, listen up, here's the deal with gay marriage. It's a no-brainer, really. There's just no solid reason to keep it illegal.\n\nSome folks say gay couples are a threat to the traditional family, but come on, it's totally different. Think of it like two sides of the same coin – different, but still the same essential thing.\n\nAnd it's not just about love; there's a whole heap of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick 'cause they're not legally family.  It's crazy!  If you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?\n\nPlus, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about the relationship, the connection, the love – not the gender of the people involved.\n\nLet's be real, it's not about church weddings. Gay couples are just asking for a government-recognized marriage certificate, a legal document.  \n\nIt's like saying one type of love is more valid than another. If you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage? It's all about equality.\n\nAnd yeah, there are concerns about kids and adoption, but those are just fears based on ignorance. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples.  \n\nLook, I get that some people have strong religious beliefs, but the government shouldn't be making laws based on religion. That's not fair to everyone else. It's like saying only one group's morality matters.  \n\nIt's hypocritcal, considering the government itself is founded on the idea of separation of church and state.\n\nThe bottom line is, gay people deserve the same rights and respect as everyone else.  It's time to stop judging and start embracing love in all its forms.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin'. I work in a hospital pharmacy, see, and lemme just say, just 'cause somethin's illegal don't mean it ain't got some good uses.  I mean, should we just make it easy for everyone to get their hands on it? Nah, not a chance. But for medicinal purposes?  Absolutely!  Cause listen, just 'cause somethin's against the law don't mean it ain't got some good stuff going for it.  \n\nThink about it, there are a bunch of drugs pharmacies use that are totally illegal on the street, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet – they're all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they help people.  So why are we denying folks the potential benefits of marijuana just 'cause there's this whole stigma around it? \n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's exactly like alcohol, 'cause abusin' either one can lead to trouble.  It's a tricky situation, but I reckon we could ease into it – make it legal gradually, not all at once.  Otherwise, people might go overboard.  But first, we gotta knock down this whole negative image around marijuana.  \n\nPeople think it's this terrible, evil drug, but it ain't like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop seein' it as this monster, folks might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Alright, so my church, it's totally changed up in the 21st century. Not as stiff and strict as it used to be, you know?  When I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards.  I went to this private school, and all my friends would be there too. We'd just hang out. Now, they've got these teenager masses, like a 30-minute version, and everyone's dressed way more casual.  Especially in summer, folks roll in straight from the beach, you know? Families running in late, the works!\n\nEven the morning masses, where I used to get all dressed up, are chill now. Jeans and khakis are the norm.  Khakis are cool, don't get me wrong, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest thing I've noticed about the church changing. I don't really know about the behind-the-scenes stuff, all the politics, but that's the vibe I'm getting. \n\n\nNow, about those scandals with priests and stuff... I don't think making priests married would have stopped it.  I mean, there are married guys who become pedophiles, right? It's not about being married or not. It's about the person. Maybe it's a choice they make when they become priests, who knows?\n\nThere are other religions where priests can get married, like the ones on TV shows. They're ministers or something. If they really want to be married and practice their faith, maybe they should check out a different church.\n\n\n\nI think it's kind of like genetics, you know? Like, some people are just born that way.  You can't really change that.  Maybe upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly genetics.  You can try to hide it, but it usually comes out in the end.  \n\nThe church might have screwed up by covering things up, but I don't think they could have stopped it from happening in all cases.",
            "(laughs) \n  Man, September 11th really messed things up. It's like the whole world went crazy. I mean, I was okay with the idea of going into Iraq at first, but it all felt so rushed and  tense. It's like the Bush crew used 9/11 as an excuse, a big red herring, to justify invading. They were spouting about Bin Laden and WMDs, but it all turned out to be a load of crap!  It just makes me so mad that they straight up lied to the American people. \n\n  Even Colin Powell, the guy who gave that whole big speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. C'mon, that's just plain wrong. It's a slap in the face to everyone who believed them, and it feels like a major betrayal of trust. It's like they think they're above the law, like they can just make things up and the public will believe them. \n\n  And don't even get me started on how they've been treating the Constitution. It's like they're trying to push it aside, destroy it piece by piece.  They came into office with war on their minds, and maybe even some dark, personal reasons. I heard this thing about the treasury secretary who basically called them out on it in his book.  He got kicked out, but it made you wonder.\n\n  It just feels like this whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would be a mess, probably cause more bloodshed and chaos. But putting other countries in charge? Doesn't sound good either. What about Iraq's sovereignty? It's already shaky, and things are falling apart in the government. \n\n  The parliament's a joke, the prime minister can't control anything, and these religious groups are playing power games. It's a recipe for disaster, honestly. It's like a giant, messed up game of musical chairs, and nobody knows who's going to be left standing in the end. \n\n (laughs) \n  I can't even begin to explain the whole thing without getting really angry.",
            "The Iraq War, man... it's a real head-scratcher. Feels pointless, you know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, a formal declaration and all that. Just this whole \"get back at Iraq\" thing 'cause they were blamed for 9/11. Not my scene, honestly. Not really into the whole thing.\n\nI don't keep up with the details, but it seems like we're stuck there trying to build democracy, make it more like the U.S., and grab some oil while we're at it. But it's causing so much unrest, and what's the point of staying forever? Building democracy takes time, forever even, and if we leave, they'll be furious 'cause we messed everything up and they're back to square one.\n\nUgh, this is tough. This is one topic I'm clueless about.  \n\nI guess I kinda want it to continue, though. Not because it's right, but because… it's like, we gotta show 'em we're strong, you know? We're America, we got the big guns. But it's not really a war anymore, not in the traditional sense. Congress never officially declared it, so…\n\nMaybe we should just help them out, try to rebuild. But it's also a waste of resources. And poor Bush, he's taking all the heat. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, a meaningless war that'll haunt him forever.\n\nI gotta think of the families with loved ones in Iraq. They want it to keep going so their kids come home safe. These people over there deserve better, they've lost everything.

            "Right, so, I just don't feel it's right for the government to get involved in this whole thing. It's like, the Constitution says separation of church and state, right?  It's plain as day. To me, trying to make laws about something like this feels like going against what's already been written.  \n\nIt's like, you've got all these different churches, all with their own beliefs, and some are okay with it, while others aren't. It's just picking sides, you know?  Forcing one church's view on everyone else. \n\nAnd the whole idea of making it illegal?  That just seems wrong. It's like trying to tell people what they can and can't believe.   Separation of church and state is a big deal in America, it's what lets people practice their religion freely.  \n\nAdding an amendment would be like going backwards. It's gotta be one of the few amendments that'd be used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nHonestly, I don't see any reason for the government to be involved at all. This whole push for an amendment just feels like it's coming from one guy's personal beliefs. He's basically saying that his religion's view is the only one that matters.  \n\nIt should be up to the churches to decide. Let them sort it out amongst themselves. It's not the government's place to interfere.",
            "The Iraq War, man... It's messed up. I don't think the government was straight with us about why we went in there. They tried to link it to 9/11, like it was all connected, but that just wasn't true. They played on our fear and anger after that terrible day, and suddenly we were invading Iraq in 2003.  \n\nLook, I'm against war, always have been. Especially preemptive strikes – that's just wrong. This whole thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, it's heartbreaking. They went in there, ripped out the government, and weren't ready for what came next. They didn't think about the chaos, the power vacuum.  \n\nThey tried to shove democracy in there, like it's some magic cure-all, just like they did in Vietnam. Pushing out Communists, trying to force democracy on a nation, it's a recipe for disaster. It's a long, hard road, not a quick victory. \n\nIt's like, even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there's always gonna be resistance. You can't just fight an army, you're fighting the people themselves. It's messy, it's tough, and it's not a clear-cut win. \n\nWe should have been more prepared. We should have known it wouldn't be easy.  They made it seem simple, but it's not.  Taking down a government and building something new takes time, years of struggle, just ask our own history! \n\nWe're still there in 2006, more American lives lost, training their troops, trying to hold things together. It's a mess, and I just hope it ends soon, for everyone's sake. But honestly, it feels like we're stuck in a quicksand of our own making.\n\nWe're talking about getting oil, right? Controlling resources. And what about those weapons of mass destruction we were told about? They never found any! But we're not even talking about North Korea, a country we know has them. It's all so shady. \n\n\n\nWe're stuck in this war, and I just hope it ends soon, but it feels like we're doing more harm than good.",

I live in a neighborhood where there are a couple of gay couples, you know, livin' their lives just like everyone else.  They walk their dogs, they go to the store, they're just tryin' to live their lives. It's not like they're hurtin' anyone.\n\nAnd this whole Bush thing, tryin' to play God and decide what marriage means? Ridiculous, I tell ya! It's like he's trying to rewrite the rules just because he doesn't understand.\n\nThere's all this talk now about how bein' gay might be somethin' you're born with, a chemical thing in your brain. It's not like you choose to be gay, any more than you choose your eye color. \n\nThe whole thing is just messed up. If a man and a woman want to get married, they don't need anyone's permission. But if two guys or two gals want to do the same thing, it's suddenly a national scandal. It's like they're tryin' to make it a bigger deal than it needs to be. It should be a private matter, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so here's the deal.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. You can't take it back, you know? As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nThink about it:  if you're posting about blowing stuff up or shooting people, someone's going to freak out.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's out there for the whole world to see.  If your friend sees it on Myspace, that's one thing. But if someone brings it to the school's attention, they have to take it seriously. They can't just ignore it, what if something actually happens?\n\nNow, I know some people just mess around online, but you never know. It could be a joke gone wrong, like that sociology experiment we had at school.  Or it could be something really serious.\n\nHere's what happened at our school: someone overheard someone else saying something scary, so they reported it. When they tracked down the person, they looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that seemed harmless at first, but in light of the situation, it became really concerning.\n\nThe bottom line? Once you put something online, it's out there. You can't control how people interpret it. You can't tell them what to think or what to take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you gave access to your stuff shared it with them.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles and friend their students. That's just creepy. It's not my place to know if my residents are out drinking and posting about it on Facebook. I don't want that connection.",
            "This war's been dragged on far too long, ya know?  At first, I thought the goal was legit - bringing democracy to a place that needed it.  But now?  It feels like we're just proving we're some kind of big-shot superpower, like we gotta flex our muscles.  Plus, there's all this talk about Bush Sr.'s beef with Saddam back in the day.  Makes you wonder if there's more to it than meets the eye.  If the goal was to give folks a fairer shot at a say in their government, that's a good thing.  But if it was just about settling old scores, well, that ain't right. \n\nLook, I get it, the first few months showed the world we weren't messing around.  But we've been at this for years now, and it just feels wrong.  It's like we're stuck in a rut, fighting for the sake of fighting, not for any clear purpose anymore.  We need a win, a clean break, something to show we actually accomplished something.\n\nWe gotta face facts: this thing's gone on too long.  Those folks gotta figure things out on their own eventually, right?  We've been pouring billions into this, money that could be used right here at home.  We got our own problems - poverty, schools, healthcare...  These are things that need our attention, not endless war.  It's a drain on our economy, a drain on our soul.  We can't keep sending our young people to fight a war that's lost its meaning.",
            "Okay, so there's this thing, right? Someone found out about, well, something someone else posted online, and that stopped something bad from happening.  I mean, on sites like Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  Like, yeah, you need a friend request or whatever, but you're kinda giving them permission when you accept it, right?  It's like, if you put it on the internet, you gotta be cool with people seeing it.  So I think it was actually good that someone spotted that and could help.\n\nBut then, it's a bit of a dilemma, you know? It's not like someone can watch everyone's profile all day.  And what if they start targeting \"bad kids\"?  That just feels wrong.  It's gotta be some kind of balance, right?  Like, were they looking for something specific, or did they just stumble across it by chance? \n\nPersonally, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook.  It freaks me out a little knowing there are creepy people who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV once about this guy who just showed how easy it was to find info on people.  He got this girl's screen name off her profile and started chatting with her on IM within a minute.  She met up with him! I wouldn't do that, obviously.\n\nI've had people in my classes message me on Facebook who I don't recognize.  They know it's me though, and it's weird.  They know your interests, what you look like, maybe even where you are during the day.  It's a lot of info, and I try to be careful about what I post, but then again, I want to be able to connect with friends.  It's a tough balance.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed strange to me.  Like, how can they tell students what they can and can't do online?  Maybe it's a privacy thing, but I don't know.  It just felt wrong.",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing...it's just a mess. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who were \"against it from the start,\" but I was. It's just that now, it's kinda like everyone agrees it was a bad idea except for the folks in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong. \n\nAnd honestly, look at the polls. They've done them everywhere, US, Iraq, even globally, and it's like 75-80% of the world thinks it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, even! And get this, a good chunk of the US troops over there think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's just been a disaster from day one. Even before we showed up, Iraq was messed up, and now this whole leaving thing is gonna be a disaster too.  There's no easy way out when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a huge cultural clash between us and those countries.  Our government just doesn't get it. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt about it. But you gotta weigh the pros and cons before invading a country and turning it into a giant quicksand pit.\n\nI don't even know what to say anymore. The only reason I can see for staying is what the administration thinks, but I haven't heard a single good reason that makes sense. If they wanna pull out gradually over a year or so, I could see that. But why stay any longer?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them think we should just leave now!  These are the people we're supposed to be helping, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, we can say \"Well, you guys made the call.\" Then, if things go south, we can step in and help, and maybe, just maybe, we'll be seen as the good guys. \n\nBut let's be real, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Okay, so like, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a huge thing in the US. It's not just about women, though. It's more like, it depends on what kind of work you do, ya know?  \n\nI mean, overall, it seems like women still have it rougher. There's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, dudes still have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages, you know? \n\nSo, women might see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just 'cause historically, women haven't been in those top positions. It's like they're stuck looking up at the top, but no one's letting them climb.\n\nAnd the same goes for guys, like in fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  It's super rare to see a dude staying home while his wife works.  People kinda judge them for it, like, \"Dude, you should be the breadwinner!\"  Even if it's what they really want,  society pushes back hard. \n\nAnd in fashion, it's kinda weird, right? People don't always take straight dudes seriously in that world. It's like they think they can't \"get\" fashion 'cause it's supposed to be a woman's thing.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's definitely still gender discrimination in the US, and it's different depending on what you do.  Changing it is tough because people are stuck in their ways. We've come a long way from the 1800s, but slow and steady, I guess. Women are getting more CEO jobs, and people are starting to accept stay-at-home dads more. \n\nIt's all about showing people the good qualities of those who are often stereotyped. If you push too hard, people resist. We gotta be patient, I guess. Change takes time.",
            "Right, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They made it so it's not a criminal offense anymore. More like a parking ticket, you get cited instead of getting thrown in jail.  I mean,  it still hangs over ya, especially when you're lookin' for a job or whatever.  Those  ramifications, like the worst parts of a drug charge, well, they don't exactly disappear just 'cause it's decriminalized. \n\nBut, think about it, arresting folks, booking 'em, housing 'em, court dates, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all costs a bundle. A whole lotta dough.  Especially for places that are struggling financially. Some places, they're just dead set against it, even if it'd save 'em money. \n\nBut in cities like Denver, where folks are a bit more... open-minded, ya know? More liberal,  it makes sense to me.  They probably have a lot more dough now for schools, helpin' old folks, feedin' the homeless.  It's a win-win, right?\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' we should be handin' out joints like candy.  There's a reason it's still a bit taboo.  But financially, it's gotta be a factor. \n\nIf it was fully legal, imagine it everywhere, like cigarettes. Gas stations, cars, everywhere.  Folks gettin' high and drivin'?  That ain't right.\n\nAnd besides, society ain't quite ready for that kinda openness, ya know?\n\nIt's like with alcohol, it messes with your coordination, but marijuana, it messes with your whole life, ya know? They both have their downsides, but everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, others... not so much.",
            "So, about Catholicism... I mean, there's a lot to like. They've got traditions that have stood the test of time, which is cool. It's good to have roots, right? But, at the same time, you've gotta be able to adapt and change with the times. \n\nThe thing is, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church is stuck in the past. They're super strict about how things are done, and honestly, it can feel kinda judgmental towards people who don't follow the rules perfectly. Like, what about people who aren't, you know, *perfect* Catholics? Or people who practice different religions?\n\nMy dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but they wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of his religion.  That doesn't seem very loving or accepting, does it?  They preach about loving everyone but then turn around and exclude people who aren't exactly like them. It's kinda hypocritical, if you ask me.\n\nYou see, a lot of Catholic teaching is about doing good things, but then their practices don't always line up with that.  It's like they're clinging to outdated traditions even though they don't really make sense anymore.\n\nNow, about those priests who... well, you know...  I think it would be good if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing those bad things. It's a separate issue, really.\n\nI mean, people who hurt children are going to hurt children, whether they're married or not.  It's just a different kind of wrong.  Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve that problem.",
            "So, I'm kinda stuck on this whole marriage thing.  It's a real head-scratcher, ya know?  Like, where do you draw the line between church and state?  And what even *is* marriage, anyway?  It's a tough one because it feels like no matter what you say, someone's gonna get their knickers in a twist.\n\nI'm thinking maybe all these unions, whether they're called \"marriage\" or \"civil union,\" should be treated the same.  I mean, why should the government care *how* you define it, as long as it's between two consenting adults?  It's like, wouldn't it be kinda weird if the government decided to recognize baptisms or other religious stuff?  Just let people love who they love, right?\n\nAs for gay marriage, I think if states can figure out a way to make it work, then cool, let's make it federal law.  But changing the Constitution just to ban it?  That's just plain bonkers.  It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but is it *that* big of a deal to amend the Constitution over?\n\nHonestly, it just feels kinda pointless.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a complicated issue for me. \n\nSee, I have lots of gay friends, so I can't just brush it off. I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to choose who they love. \n\nThis whole thing shouldn't be a national debate, though. Each state should decide for themselves if they want to legalize gay marriage.  \n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, like California or New York, while others are more conservative, like Texas or Alabama. \n\nIf you live in a state where gay marriage is legal, well, that's just how it is there. You're basically agreeing to those rules when you move there.  \n\nLook, I think everyone deserves equal opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I'm all for legalization, but let each state make that call. \n\nIt's not right for the president to impose his views on the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide what's best for them. \n\nBesides, Bush is leaving office soon anyway.  What's the point of fighting over this when a new president could change everything in a heartbeat? \n\nLet the states figure it out, that's what I say. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Listen, I get it. Myspace is like a public billboard, right?  If you put something up there, it's basically for everyone to see, teachers included.  I mean, even if they're not using the school's name, they can still check it out from home.  It's like, if you're posting something you don't want people to see, maybe don't post it online at all. \n\nNow, I get that some people think it's a privacy invasion if they're just snooping around looking for students doing dumb stuff.  But if they see something that could prevent a shooting, or keep kids safe, well, that seems pretty important to me.  It's like, the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe, and if that means checking Myspace, so be it.\n\nThink about it: if schools are checking email, why not Myspace?  They're just trying to make sure everyone's safe, and if that means looking at what people are posting online, well, it's kind of a necessary evil, right?",
            "Okay, so, about the war...  It all started after 9/11. I was right there in the thick of it, personally affected, and fueled by anger.  I was all for going over there and dishing out some serious payback. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. It was a knee-jerk reaction,  a bit impulsive. We rushed into things without a solid plan, and honestly, it backfired spectacularly.  \n\nI mean, I used to be all for it, but now?  I'm against it completely. I don't see any real progress, any positive outcome. The people over there, they're constantly fighting amongst themselves.  How can we expect them to focus on us when they can't even get along? It feels like we're just stirring the pot, creating more chaos. \n\nTo be honest, 9/11 changed things for me. I've almost become numb to what's going on there. I just don't care anymore. They're fighting, they're killing each other, it's a vicious cycle. They seem so different from us, so savage in their approach to war. I don't think they're trying to build a better future, just trying to push us out. Maybe that's what they want, and maybe we should just give it to them.\n\nWe went in there unprepared, with no clear idea of what we were facing. War is different for them, way more brutal. We  were blinded by revenge, fueled by the need for justice after 9/11. President Bush, well, he felt the pressure from the people, wanted to act tough.  I understand where he was coming from, but maybe declaring war on Iraq was a mistake.  \n\nWe should have had a better plan, a clearer purpose. There wasn't enough unity, everyone was just reacting instead of thinking. It all felt emotional, not strategic.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we were ever meant to change those people. They're stuck in their ways, and no amount of force will break that cycle. It's time to admit we've made a mess of things and just leave.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying. They'll just fall back into chaos once we withdraw, and we can't keep throwing our lives away trying to fix it. We need to let go."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so here's the deal, I think the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly cool with a lot of stuff.  They're super against things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  And while they're entitled to their views, they're kinda stuck in the past, ya know? \n\nI feel like if they loosened up a bit, maybe embraced some newer ideas, they wouldn't be so worried about people leaving.  I've been hearing that folks are starting to ditch the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nLike, if you're pro-choice, you're probably not gonna feel comfy in a place that says abortion is totally wrong. Or if you're all about gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't support it.  \n\nIt just seems like a bit of a clash.\n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests or priests who are married?  It's not like it would hurt anything.  I don't know if it would have stopped all the bad stuff that's happened, but it's something to think about.\n\nIt's just weird to me that priests are supposed to be \"married to God,\" but they can't have families or spouses.  Everyone else gets to have both their job and their personal life.  Why not priests?",
            "Okay, so, um, me personally? I'm cool with gay marriage.  Like, I don't think it's some kinda choice people make, you know? I mean, some folks are born that way, just like some folks are born straight. It's kinda like you can't pick your hair color, right? So, it seems wrong to say, \"Oh, a man and a woman can get married, but two dudes or two gals can't.\" That just doesn't sit right with me.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems unfair. It's not like they're choosing to be gay, it's just who they are. I was born straight, but I wouldn't want someone telling me I couldn't get married because of that, y'know? So, yeah, I think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it affects national security or anything. It's just people's personal lives. I don't think it's a moral issue either.  \n\nIt's just weird to me that people would make such a big deal out of it. Like, they're not hurting anyone. It's not their fault how they feel. They shouldn't have to hide who they are or be ashamed of it. They should be able to love who they love, just like everyone else.",
            "Alright, listen up, here's the deal with gay marriage. It's a no-brainer, really. There's just no solid reason to keep it illegal.\n\nSome folks say gay couples are a threat to the traditional family, but come on, it's totally different. Think of it like two sides of the same coin – different, but still the same essential thing.\n\nAnd it's not just about love; there's a whole heap of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick 'cause they're not legally family.  It's crazy!  If you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?\n\nPlus, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about the relationship, the connection, the love – not the gender of the people involved.\n\nLet's be real, it's not about church weddings. Gay couples are just asking for a government-recognized marriage certificate, a legal document.  \n\nIt's like saying one type of love is more valid than another. If you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage? It's all about equality.\n\nAnd yeah, there are concerns about kids and adoption, but those are just fears based on ignorance. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples.  \n\nLook, I get that some people have strong religious beliefs, but the government shouldn't be making laws based on religion. That's not fair to everyone else. It's like saying only one group's morality matters.  \n\nIt's hypocritcal, considering the government itself is founded on the idea of separation of church and state.\n\nThe bottom line is, gay people deserve the same rights and respect as everyone else.  It's time to stop judging and start embracing love in all its forms.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin'. I work in a hospital pharmacy, see, and lemme just say, just 'cause somethin's illegal don't mean it ain't got some good uses.  I mean, should we just make it easy for everyone to get their hands on it? Nah, not a chance. But for medicinal purposes?  Absolutely!  Cause listen, just 'cause somethin's against the law don't mean it ain't got some good stuff going for it.  \n\nThink about it, there are a bunch of drugs pharmacies use that are totally illegal on the street, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet – they're all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they help people.  So why are we denying folks the potential benefits of marijuana just 'cause there's this whole stigma around it? \n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's exactly like alcohol, 'cause abusin' either one can lead to trouble.  It's a tricky situation, but I reckon we could ease into it – make it legal gradually, not all at once.  Otherwise, people might go overboard.  But first, we gotta knock down this whole negative image around marijuana.  \n\nPeople think it's this terrible, evil drug, but it ain't like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop seein' it as this monster, folks might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Alright, so my church, it's totally changed up in the 21st century. Not as stiff and strict as it used to be, you know?  When I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards.  I went to this private school, and all my friends would be there too. We'd just hang out. Now, they've got these teenager masses, like a 30-minute version, and everyone's dressed way more casual.  Especially in summer, folks roll in straight from the beach, you know? Families running in late, the works!\n\nEven the morning masses, where I used to get all dressed up, are chill now. Jeans and khakis are the norm.  Khakis are cool, don't get me wrong, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest thing I've noticed about the church changing. I don't really know about the behind-the-scenes stuff, all the politics, but that's the vibe I'm getting. \n\n\nNow, about those scandals with priests and stuff... I don't think making priests married would have stopped it.  I mean, there are married guys who become pedophiles, right? It's not about being married or not. It's about the person. Maybe it's a choice they make when they become priests, who knows?\n\nThere are other religions where priests can get married, like the ones on TV shows. They're ministers or something. If they really want to be married and practice their faith, maybe they should check out a different church.\n\n\n\nI think it's kind of like genetics, you know? Like, some people are just born that way.  You can't really change that.  Maybe upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly genetics.  You can try to hide it, but it usually comes out in the end.  \n\nThe church might have screwed up by covering things up, but I don't think they could have stopped it from happening in all cases.",
            "(laughs) \n  Man, September 11th really messed things up. It's like the whole world went crazy. I mean, I was okay with the idea of going into Iraq at first, but it all felt so rushed and  tense. It's like the Bush crew used 9/11 as an excuse, a big red herring, to justify invading. They were spouting about Bin Laden and WMDs, but it all turned out to be a load of crap!  It just makes me so mad that they straight up lied to the American people. \n\n  Even Colin Powell, the guy who gave that whole big speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. C'mon, that's just plain wrong. It's a slap in the face to everyone who believed them, and it feels like a major betrayal of trust. It's like they think they're above the law, like they can just make things up and the public will believe them. \n\n  And don't even get me started on how they've been treating the Constitution. It's like they're trying to push it aside, destroy it piece by piece.  They came into office with war on their minds, and maybe even some dark, personal reasons. I heard this thing about the treasury secretary who basically called them out on it in his book.  He got kicked out, but it made you wonder.\n\n  It just feels like this whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would be a mess, probably cause more bloodshed and chaos. But putting other countries in charge? Doesn't sound good either. What about Iraq's sovereignty? It's already shaky, and things are falling apart in the government. \n\n  The parliament's a joke, the prime minister can't control anything, and these religious groups are playing power games. It's a recipe for disaster, honestly. It's like a giant, messed up game of musical chairs, and nobody knows who's going to be left standing in the end. \n\n (laughs) \n  I can't even begin to explain the whole thing without getting really angry.",
            "The Iraq War, man... it's a real head-scratcher. Feels pointless, you know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, a formal declaration and all that. Just this whole \"get back at Iraq\" thing 'cause they were blamed for 9/11. Not my scene, honestly. Not really into the whole thing.\n\nI don't keep up with the details, but it seems like we're stuck there trying to build democracy, make it more like the U.S., and grab some oil while we're at it. But it's causing so much unrest, and what's the point of staying forever? Building democracy takes time, forever even, and if we leave, they'll be furious 'cause we messed everything up and they're back to square one.\n\nUgh, this is tough. This is one topic I'm clueless about.  \n\nI guess I kinda want it to continue, though. Not because it's right, but because… it's like, we gotta show 'em we're strong, you know? We're America, we got the big guns. But it's not really a war anymore, not in the traditional sense. Congress never officially declared it, so…\n\nMaybe we should just help them out, try to rebuild. But it's also a waste of resources. And poor Bush, he's taking all the heat. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, a meaningless war that'll haunt him forever.\n\nI gotta think of the families with loved ones in Iraq. They want it to keep going so their kids come home safe. These people over there deserve better, they've lost everything.

            "Right, so, I just don't feel it's right for the government to get involved in this whole thing. It's like, the Constitution says separation of church and state, right?  It's plain as day. To me, trying to make laws about something like this feels like going against what's already been written.  \n\nIt's like, you've got all these different churches, all with their own beliefs, and some are okay with it, while others aren't. It's just picking sides, you know?  Forcing one church's view on everyone else. \n\nAnd the whole idea of making it illegal?  That just seems wrong. It's like trying to tell people what they can and can't believe.   Separation of church and state is a big deal in America, it's what lets people practice their religion freely.  \n\nAdding an amendment would be like going backwards. It's gotta be one of the few amendments that'd be used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nHonestly, I don't see any reason for the government to be involved at all. This whole push for an amendment just feels like it's coming from one guy's personal beliefs. He's basically saying that his religion's view is the only one that matters.  \n\nIt should be up to the churches to decide. Let them sort it out amongst themselves. It's not the government's place to interfere.",
            "The Iraq War, man... It's messed up. I don't think the government was straight with us about why we went in there. They tried to link it to 9/11, like it was all connected, but that just wasn't true. They played on our fear and anger after that terrible day, and suddenly we were invading Iraq in 2003.  \n\nLook, I'm against war, always have been. Especially preemptive strikes – that's just wrong. This whole thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, it's heartbreaking. They went in there, ripped out the government, and weren't ready for what came next. They didn't think about the chaos, the power vacuum.  \n\nThey tried to shove democracy in there, like it's some magic cure-all, just like they did in Vietnam. Pushing out Communists, trying to force democracy on a nation, it's a recipe for disaster. It's a long, hard road, not a quick victory. \n\nIt's like, even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there's always gonna be resistance. You can't just fight an army, you're fighting the people themselves. It's messy, it's tough, and it's not a clear-cut win. \n\nWe should have been more prepared. We should have known it wouldn't be easy.  They made it seem simple, but it's not.  Taking down a government and building something new takes time, years of struggle, just ask our own history! \n\nWe're still there in 2006, more American lives lost, training their troops, trying to hold things together. It's a mess, and I just hope it ends soon, for everyone's sake. But honestly, it feels like we're stuck in a quicksand of our own making.\n\nWe're talking about getting oil, right? Controlling resources. And what about those weapons of mass destruction we were told about? They never found any! But we're not even talking about North Korea, a country we know has them. It's all so shady. \n\n\n\nWe're stuck in this war, and I just hope it ends soon, but it feels like we're doing more harm than good.",

I live in a neighborhood where there are a couple of gay couples, you know, livin' their lives just like everyone else.  They walk their dogs, they go to the store, they're just tryin' to live their lives. It's not like they're hurtin' anyone.\n\nAnd this whole Bush thing, tryin' to play God and decide what marriage means? Ridiculous, I tell ya! It's like he's trying to rewrite the rules just because he doesn't understand.\n\nThere's all this talk now about how bein' gay might be somethin' you're born with, a chemical thing in your brain. It's not like you choose to be gay, any more than you choose your eye color. \n\nThe whole thing is just messed up. If a man and a woman want to get married, they don't need anyone's permission. But if two guys or two gals want to do the same thing, it's suddenly a national scandal. It's like they're tryin' to make it a bigger deal than it needs to be. It should be a private matter, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so here's the deal.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. You can't take it back, you know? As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nThink about it:  if you're posting about blowing stuff up or shooting people, someone's going to freak out.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's out there for the whole world to see.  If your friend sees it on Myspace, that's one thing. But if someone brings it to the school's attention, they have to take it seriously. They can't just ignore it, what if something actually happens?\n\nNow, I know some people just mess around online, but you never know. It could be a joke gone wrong, like that sociology experiment we had at school.  Or it could be something really serious.\n\nHere's what happened at our school: someone overheard someone else saying something scary, so they reported it. When they tracked down the person, they looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that seemed harmless at first, but in light of the situation, it became really concerning.\n\nThe bottom line? Once you put something online, it's out there. You can't control how people interpret it. You can't tell them what to think or what to take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you gave access to your stuff shared it with them.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles and friend their students. That's just creepy. It's not my place to know if my residents are out drinking and posting about it on Facebook. I don't want that connection.",
            "This war's been dragged on far too long, ya know?  At first, I thought the goal was legit - bringing democracy to a place that needed it.  But now?  It feels like we're just proving we're some kind of big-shot superpower, like we gotta flex our muscles.  Plus, there's all this talk about Bush Sr.'s beef with Saddam back in the day.  Makes you wonder if there's more to it than meets the eye.  If the goal was to give folks a fairer shot at a say in their government, that's a good thing.  But if it was just about settling old scores, well, that ain't right. \n\nLook, I get it, the first few months showed the world we weren't messing around.  But we've been at this for years now, and it just feels wrong.  It's like we're stuck in a rut, fighting for the sake of fighting, not for any clear purpose anymore.  We need a win, a clean break, something to show we actually accomplished something.\n\nWe gotta face facts: this thing's gone on too long.  Those folks gotta figure things out on their own eventually, right?  We've been pouring billions into this, money that could be used right here at home.  We got our own problems - poverty, schools, healthcare...  These are things that need our attention, not endless war.  It's a drain on our economy, a drain on our soul.  We can't keep sending our young people to fight a war that's lost its meaning.",
            "Okay, so there's this thing, right? Someone found out about, well, something someone else posted online, and that stopped something bad from happening.  I mean, on sites like Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  Like, yeah, you need a friend request or whatever, but you're kinda giving them permission when you accept it, right?  It's like, if you put it on the internet, you gotta be cool with people seeing it.  So I think it was actually good that someone spotted that and could help.\n\nBut then, it's a bit of a dilemma, you know? It's not like someone can watch everyone's profile all day.  And what if they start targeting \"bad kids\"?  That just feels wrong.  It's gotta be some kind of balance, right?  Like, were they looking for something specific, or did they just stumble across it by chance? \n\nPersonally, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook.  It freaks me out a little knowing there are creepy people who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV once about this guy who just showed how easy it was to find info on people.  He got this girl's screen name off her profile and started chatting with her on IM within a minute.  She met up with him! I wouldn't do that, obviously.\n\nI've had people in my classes message me on Facebook who I don't recognize.  They know it's me though, and it's weird.  They know your interests, what you look like, maybe even where you are during the day.  It's a lot of info, and I try to be careful about what I post, but then again, I want to be able to connect with friends.  It's a tough balance.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed strange to me.  Like, how can they tell students what they can and can't do online?  Maybe it's a privacy thing, but I don't know.  It just felt wrong.",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing...it's just a mess. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who were \"against it from the start,\" but I was. It's just that now, it's kinda like everyone agrees it was a bad idea except for the folks in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong. \n\nAnd honestly, look at the polls. They've done them everywhere, US, Iraq, even globally, and it's like 75-80% of the world thinks it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, even! And get this, a good chunk of the US troops over there think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's just been a disaster from day one. Even before we showed up, Iraq was messed up, and now this whole leaving thing is gonna be a disaster too.  There's no easy way out when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a huge cultural clash between us and those countries.  Our government just doesn't get it. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt about it. But you gotta weigh the pros and cons before invading a country and turning it into a giant quicksand pit.\n\nI don't even know what to say anymore. The only reason I can see for staying is what the administration thinks, but I haven't heard a single good reason that makes sense. If they wanna pull out gradually over a year or so, I could see that. But why stay any longer?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them think we should just leave now!  These are the people we're supposed to be helping, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, we can say \"Well, you guys made the call.\" Then, if things go south, we can step in and help, and maybe, just maybe, we'll be seen as the good guys. \n\nBut let's be real, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Okay, so like, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a huge thing in the US. It's not just about women, though. It's more like, it depends on what kind of work you do, ya know?  \n\nI mean, overall, it seems like women still have it rougher. There's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, dudes still have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages, you know? \n\nSo, women might see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just 'cause historically, women haven't been in those top positions. It's like they're stuck looking up at the top, but no one's letting them climb.\n\nAnd the same goes for guys, like in fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  It's super rare to see a dude staying home while his wife works.  People kinda judge them for it, like, \"Dude, you should be the breadwinner!\"  Even if it's what they really want,  society pushes back hard. \n\nAnd in fashion, it's kinda weird, right? People don't always take straight dudes seriously in that world. It's like they think they can't \"get\" fashion 'cause it's supposed to be a woman's thing.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's definitely still gender discrimination in the US, and it's different depending on what you do.  Changing it is tough because people are stuck in their ways. We've come a long way from the 1800s, but slow and steady, I guess. Women are getting more CEO jobs, and people are starting to accept stay-at-home dads more. \n\nIt's all about showing people the good qualities of those who are often stereotyped. If you push too hard, people resist. We gotta be patient, I guess. Change takes time.",
            "Right, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They made it so it's not a criminal offense anymore. More like a parking ticket, you get cited instead of getting thrown in jail.  I mean,  it still hangs over ya, especially when you're lookin' for a job or whatever.  Those  ramifications, like the worst parts of a drug charge, well, they don't exactly disappear just 'cause it's decriminalized. \n\nBut, think about it, arresting folks, booking 'em, housing 'em, court dates, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all costs a bundle. A whole lotta dough.  Especially for places that are struggling financially. Some places, they're just dead set against it, even if it'd save 'em money. \n\nBut in cities like Denver, where folks are a bit more... open-minded, ya know? More liberal,  it makes sense to me.  They probably have a lot more dough now for schools, helpin' old folks, feedin' the homeless.  It's a win-win, right?\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' we should be handin' out joints like candy.  There's a reason it's still a bit taboo.  But financially, it's gotta be a factor. \n\nIf it was fully legal, imagine it everywhere, like cigarettes. Gas stations, cars, everywhere.  Folks gettin' high and drivin'?  That ain't right.\n\nAnd besides, society ain't quite ready for that kinda openness, ya know?\n\nIt's like with alcohol, it messes with your coordination, but marijuana, it messes with your whole life, ya know? They both have their downsides, but everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, others... not so much.",
            "So, about Catholicism... I mean, there's a lot to like. They've got traditions that have stood the test of time, which is cool. It's good to have roots, right? But, at the same time, you've gotta be able to adapt and change with the times. \n\nThe thing is, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church is stuck in the past. They're super strict about how things are done, and honestly, it can feel kinda judgmental towards people who don't follow the rules perfectly. Like, what about people who aren't, you know, *perfect* Catholics? Or people who practice different religions?\n\nMy dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but they wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of his religion.  That doesn't seem very loving or accepting, does it?  They preach about loving everyone but then turn around and exclude people who aren't exactly like them. It's kinda hypocritical, if you ask me.\n\nYou see, a lot of Catholic teaching is about doing good things, but then their practices don't always line up with that.  It's like they're clinging to outdated traditions even though they don't really make sense anymore.\n\nNow, about those priests who... well, you know...  I think it would be good if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing those bad things. It's a separate issue, really.\n\nI mean, people who hurt children are going to hurt children, whether they're married or not.  It's just a different kind of wrong.  Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve that problem.",
            "So, I'm kinda stuck on this whole marriage thing.  It's a real head-scratcher, ya know?  Like, where do you draw the line between church and state?  And what even *is* marriage, anyway?  It's a tough one because it feels like no matter what you say, someone's gonna get their knickers in a twist.\n\nI'm thinking maybe all these unions, whether they're called \"marriage\" or \"civil union,\" should be treated the same.  I mean, why should the government care *how* you define it, as long as it's between two consenting adults?  It's like, wouldn't it be kinda weird if the government decided to recognize baptisms or other religious stuff?  Just let people love who they love, right?\n\nAs for gay marriage, I think if states can figure out a way to make it work, then cool, let's make it federal law.  But changing the Constitution just to ban it?  That's just plain bonkers.  It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but is it *that* big of a deal to amend the Constitution over?\n\nHonestly, it just feels kinda pointless.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a complicated issue for me. \n\nSee, I have lots of gay friends, so I can't just brush it off. I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to choose who they love. \n\nThis whole thing shouldn't be a national debate, though. Each state should decide for themselves if they want to legalize gay marriage.  \n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, like California or New York, while others are more conservative, like Texas or Alabama. \n\nIf you live in a state where gay marriage is legal, well, that's just how it is there. You're basically agreeing to those rules when you move there.  \n\nLook, I think everyone deserves equal opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I'm all for legalization, but let each state make that call. \n\nIt's not right for the president to impose his views on the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide what's best for them. \n\nBesides, Bush is leaving office soon anyway.  What's the point of fighting over this when a new president could change everything in a heartbeat? \n\nLet the states figure it out, that's what I say. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Listen, I get it. Myspace is like a public billboard, right?  If you put something up there, it's basically for everyone to see, teachers included.  I mean, even if they're not using the school's name, they can still check it out from home.  It's like, if you're posting something you don't want people to see, maybe don't post it online at all. \n\nNow, I get that some people think it's a privacy invasion if they're just snooping around looking for students doing dumb stuff.  But if they see something that could prevent a shooting, or keep kids safe, well, that seems pretty important to me.  It's like, the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe, and if that means checking Myspace, so be it.\n\nThink about it: if schools are checking email, why not Myspace?  They're just trying to make sure everyone's safe, and if that means looking at what people are posting online, well, it's kind of a necessary evil, right?",
            "Okay, so, about the war...  It all started after 9/11. I was right there in the thick of it, personally affected, and fueled by anger.  I was all for going over there and dishing out some serious payback. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. It was a knee-jerk reaction,  a bit impulsive. We rushed into things without a solid plan, and honestly, it backfired spectacularly.  \n\nI mean, I used to be all for it, but now?  I'm against it completely. I don't see any real progress, any positive outcome. The people over there, they're constantly fighting amongst themselves.  How can we expect them to focus on us when they can't even get along? It feels like we're just stirring the pot, creating more chaos. \n\nTo be honest, 9/11 changed things for me. I've almost become numb to what's going on there. I just don't care anymore. They're fighting, they're killing each other, it's a vicious cycle. They seem so different from us, so savage in their approach to war. I don't think they're trying to build a better future, just trying to push us out. Maybe that's what they want, and maybe we should just give it to them.\n\nWe went in there unprepared, with no clear idea of what we were facing. War is different for them, way more brutal. We  were blinded by revenge, fueled by the need for justice after 9/11. President Bush, well, he felt the pressure from the people, wanted to act tough.  I understand where he was coming from, but maybe declaring war on Iraq was a mistake.  \n\nWe should have had a better plan, a clearer purpose. There wasn't enough unity, everyone was just reacting instead of thinking. It all felt emotional, not strategic.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we were ever meant to change those people. They're stuck in their ways, and no amount of force will break that cycle. It's time to admit we've made a mess of things and just leave.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying. They'll just fall back into chaos once we withdraw, and we can't keep throwing our lives away trying to fix it. We need to let go."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Okay, so here's the deal, I think the Catholic Church needs a bit of a revamp, you know? \n\nThey've been talking about losing followers, and I think it's because they're not exactly cool with a lot of stuff.  They're super against things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  And while they're entitled to their views, they're kinda stuck in the past, ya know? \n\nI feel like if they loosened up a bit, maybe embraced some newer ideas, they wouldn't be so worried about people leaving.  I've been hearing that folks are starting to ditch the Catholic Church because they don't agree with their stance on these issues.  \n\nLike, if you're pro-choice, you're probably not gonna feel comfy in a place that says abortion is totally wrong. Or if you're all about gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that doesn't support it.  \n\nIt just seems like a bit of a clash.\n\nI mean, why can't they have female priests or priests who are married?  It's not like it would hurt anything.  I don't know if it would have stopped all the bad stuff that's happened, but it's something to think about.\n\nIt's just weird to me that priests are supposed to be \"married to God,\" but they can't have families or spouses.  Everyone else gets to have both their job and their personal life.  Why not priests?",
            "Okay, so, um, me personally? I'm cool with gay marriage.  Like, I don't think it's some kinda choice people make, you know? I mean, some folks are born that way, just like some folks are born straight. It's kinda like you can't pick your hair color, right? So, it seems wrong to say, \"Oh, a man and a woman can get married, but two dudes or two gals can't.\" That just doesn't sit right with me.  \n\nI haven't really thought about it too much, but it just seems unfair. It's not like they're choosing to be gay, it's just who they are. I was born straight, but I wouldn't want someone telling me I couldn't get married because of that, y'know? So, yeah, I think it's wrong to deny them that right.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the government should even be involved. It's not like it affects national security or anything. It's just people's personal lives. I don't think it's a moral issue either.  \n\nIt's just weird to me that people would make such a big deal out of it. Like, they're not hurting anyone. It's not their fault how they feel. They shouldn't have to hide who they are or be ashamed of it. They should be able to love who they love, just like everyone else.",
            "Alright, listen up, here's the deal with gay marriage. It's a no-brainer, really. There's just no solid reason to keep it illegal.\n\nSome folks say gay couples are a threat to the traditional family, but come on, it's totally different. Think of it like two sides of the same coin – different, but still the same essential thing.\n\nAnd it's not just about love; there's a whole heap of legal stuff too. Like, if you're in a gay relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick 'cause they're not legally family.  It's crazy!  If you're spending your life with someone, shouldn't they be there for you?\n\nPlus, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about the relationship, the connection, the love – not the gender of the people involved.\n\nLet's be real, it's not about church weddings. Gay couples are just asking for a government-recognized marriage certificate, a legal document.  \n\nIt's like saying one type of love is more valid than another. If you're okay with civil unions, why not full-blown marriage? It's all about equality.\n\nAnd yeah, there are concerns about kids and adoption, but those are just fears based on ignorance. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples.  \n\nLook, I get that some people have strong religious beliefs, but the government shouldn't be making laws based on religion. That's not fair to everyone else. It's like saying only one group's morality matters.  \n\nIt's hypocritcal, considering the government itself is founded on the idea of separation of church and state.\n\nThe bottom line is, gay people deserve the same rights and respect as everyone else.  It's time to stop judging and start embracing love in all its forms.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin'. I work in a hospital pharmacy, see, and lemme just say, just 'cause somethin's illegal don't mean it ain't got some good uses.  I mean, should we just make it easy for everyone to get their hands on it? Nah, not a chance. But for medicinal purposes?  Absolutely!  Cause listen, just 'cause somethin's against the law don't mean it ain't got some good stuff going for it.  \n\nThink about it, there are a bunch of drugs pharmacies use that are totally illegal on the street, like oxycontin, vicodin, percocet – they're all controlled substances, but we use 'em all the time 'cause they help people.  So why are we denying folks the potential benefits of marijuana just 'cause there's this whole stigma around it? \n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's exactly like alcohol, 'cause abusin' either one can lead to trouble.  It's a tricky situation, but I reckon we could ease into it – make it legal gradually, not all at once.  Otherwise, people might go overboard.  But first, we gotta knock down this whole negative image around marijuana.  \n\nPeople think it's this terrible, evil drug, but it ain't like heroin or cocaine.  If we stop seein' it as this monster, folks might use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "Alright, so my church, it's totally changed up in the 21st century. Not as stiff and strict as it used to be, you know?  When I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole nine yards.  I went to this private school, and all my friends would be there too. We'd just hang out. Now, they've got these teenager masses, like a 30-minute version, and everyone's dressed way more casual.  Especially in summer, folks roll in straight from the beach, you know? Families running in late, the works!\n\nEven the morning masses, where I used to get all dressed up, are chill now. Jeans and khakis are the norm.  Khakis are cool, don't get me wrong, but it's definitely more laid-back.\n\nHonestly, that's the biggest thing I've noticed about the church changing. I don't really know about the behind-the-scenes stuff, all the politics, but that's the vibe I'm getting. \n\n\nNow, about those scandals with priests and stuff... I don't think making priests married would have stopped it.  I mean, there are married guys who become pedophiles, right? It's not about being married or not. It's about the person. Maybe it's a choice they make when they become priests, who knows?\n\nThere are other religions where priests can get married, like the ones on TV shows. They're ministers or something. If they really want to be married and practice their faith, maybe they should check out a different church.\n\n\n\nI think it's kind of like genetics, you know? Like, some people are just born that way.  You can't really change that.  Maybe upbringing plays a little part, but I think it's mostly genetics.  You can try to hide it, but it usually comes out in the end.  \n\nThe church might have screwed up by covering things up, but I don't think they could have stopped it from happening in all cases.",
            "(laughs) \n  Man, September 11th really messed things up. It's like the whole world went crazy. I mean, I was okay with the idea of going into Iraq at first, but it all felt so rushed and  tense. It's like the Bush crew used 9/11 as an excuse, a big red herring, to justify invading. They were spouting about Bin Laden and WMDs, but it all turned out to be a load of crap!  It just makes me so mad that they straight up lied to the American people. \n\n  Even Colin Powell, the guy who gave that whole big speech at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence back then. C'mon, that's just plain wrong. It's a slap in the face to everyone who believed them, and it feels like a major betrayal of trust. It's like they think they're above the law, like they can just make things up and the public will believe them. \n\n  And don't even get me started on how they've been treating the Constitution. It's like they're trying to push it aside, destroy it piece by piece.  They came into office with war on their minds, and maybe even some dark, personal reasons. I heard this thing about the treasury secretary who basically called them out on it in his book.  He got kicked out, but it made you wonder.\n\n  It just feels like this whole thing has gone on for way too long. Pulling out now would be a mess, probably cause more bloodshed and chaos. But putting other countries in charge? Doesn't sound good either. What about Iraq's sovereignty? It's already shaky, and things are falling apart in the government. \n\n  The parliament's a joke, the prime minister can't control anything, and these religious groups are playing power games. It's a recipe for disaster, honestly. It's like a giant, messed up game of musical chairs, and nobody knows who's going to be left standing in the end. \n\n (laughs) \n  I can't even begin to explain the whole thing without getting really angry.",
            "The Iraq War, man... it's a real head-scratcher. Feels pointless, you know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, a formal declaration and all that. Just this whole \"get back at Iraq\" thing 'cause they were blamed for 9/11. Not my scene, honestly. Not really into the whole thing.\n\nI don't keep up with the details, but it seems like we're stuck there trying to build democracy, make it more like the U.S., and grab some oil while we're at it. But it's causing so much unrest, and what's the point of staying forever? Building democracy takes time, forever even, and if we leave, they'll be furious 'cause we messed everything up and they're back to square one.\n\nUgh, this is tough. This is one topic I'm clueless about.  \n\nI guess I kinda want it to continue, though. Not because it's right, but because… it's like, we gotta show 'em we're strong, you know? We're America, we got the big guns. But it's not really a war anymore, not in the traditional sense. Congress never officially declared it, so…\n\nMaybe we should just help them out, try to rebuild. But it's also a waste of resources. And poor Bush, he's taking all the heat. It's like the Vietnam War all over again, a meaningless war that'll haunt him forever.\n\nI gotta think of the families with loved ones in Iraq. They want it to keep going so their kids come home safe. These people over there deserve better, they've lost everything.

            "Right, so, I just don't feel it's right for the government to get involved in this whole thing. It's like, the Constitution says separation of church and state, right?  It's plain as day. To me, trying to make laws about something like this feels like going against what's already been written.  \n\nIt's like, you've got all these different churches, all with their own beliefs, and some are okay with it, while others aren't. It's just picking sides, you know?  Forcing one church's view on everyone else. \n\nAnd the whole idea of making it illegal?  That just seems wrong. It's like trying to tell people what they can and can't believe.   Separation of church and state is a big deal in America, it's what lets people practice their religion freely.  \n\nAdding an amendment would be like going backwards. It's gotta be one of the few amendments that'd be used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nHonestly, I don't see any reason for the government to be involved at all. This whole push for an amendment just feels like it's coming from one guy's personal beliefs. He's basically saying that his religion's view is the only one that matters.  \n\nIt should be up to the churches to decide. Let them sort it out amongst themselves. It's not the government's place to interfere.",
            "The Iraq War, man... It's messed up. I don't think the government was straight with us about why we went in there. They tried to link it to 9/11, like it was all connected, but that just wasn't true. They played on our fear and anger after that terrible day, and suddenly we were invading Iraq in 2003.  \n\nLook, I'm against war, always have been. Especially preemptive strikes – that's just wrong. This whole thing feels like a repeat of Vietnam, and we should have learned from those mistakes. So many American soldiers have died, it's heartbreaking. They went in there, ripped out the government, and weren't ready for what came next. They didn't think about the chaos, the power vacuum.  \n\nThey tried to shove democracy in there, like it's some magic cure-all, just like they did in Vietnam. Pushing out Communists, trying to force democracy on a nation, it's a recipe for disaster. It's a long, hard road, not a quick victory. \n\nIt's like, even if some Iraqis wanted us there, there's always gonna be resistance. You can't just fight an army, you're fighting the people themselves. It's messy, it's tough, and it's not a clear-cut win. \n\nWe should have been more prepared. We should have known it wouldn't be easy.  They made it seem simple, but it's not.  Taking down a government and building something new takes time, years of struggle, just ask our own history! \n\nWe're still there in 2006, more American lives lost, training their troops, trying to hold things together. It's a mess, and I just hope it ends soon, for everyone's sake. But honestly, it feels like we're stuck in a quicksand of our own making.\n\nWe're talking about getting oil, right? Controlling resources. And what about those weapons of mass destruction we were told about? They never found any! But we're not even talking about North Korea, a country we know has them. It's all so shady. \n\n\n\nWe're stuck in this war, and I just hope it ends soon, but it feels like we're doing more harm than good.",

I live in a neighborhood where there are a couple of gay couples, you know, livin' their lives just like everyone else.  They walk their dogs, they go to the store, they're just tryin' to live their lives. It's not like they're hurtin' anyone.\n\nAnd this whole Bush thing, tryin' to play God and decide what marriage means? Ridiculous, I tell ya! It's like he's trying to rewrite the rules just because he doesn't understand.\n\nThere's all this talk now about how bein' gay might be somethin' you're born with, a chemical thing in your brain. It's not like you choose to be gay, any more than you choose your eye color. \n\nThe whole thing is just messed up. If a man and a woman want to get married, they don't need anyone's permission. But if two guys or two gals want to do the same thing, it's suddenly a national scandal. It's like they're tryin' to make it a bigger deal than it needs to be. It should be a private matter, not some public spectacle.",
            "Okay, so here's the deal.  When you put something online, it's like shouting it from the rooftops - everyone can hear it. You can't take it back, you know? As an R.A., I've seen this firsthand.  \n\nThink about it:  if you're posting about blowing stuff up or shooting people, someone's going to freak out.  The internet isn't just for your friends; it's out there for the whole world to see.  If your friend sees it on Myspace, that's one thing. But if someone brings it to the school's attention, they have to take it seriously. They can't just ignore it, what if something actually happens?\n\nNow, I know some people just mess around online, but you never know. It could be a joke gone wrong, like that sociology experiment we had at school.  Or it could be something really serious.\n\nHere's what happened at our school: someone overheard someone else saying something scary, so they reported it. When they tracked down the person, they looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that seemed harmless at first, but in light of the situation, it became really concerning.\n\nThe bottom line? Once you put something online, it's out there. You can't control how people interpret it. You can't tell them what to think or what to take seriously.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with their students on Myspace and Facebook and snooping through their profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to investigate. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone you gave access to your stuff shared it with them.\n\nI also think it's wrong for teachers to create fake profiles and friend their students. That's just creepy. It's not my place to know if my residents are out drinking and posting about it on Facebook. I don't want that connection.",
            "This war's been dragged on far too long, ya know?  At first, I thought the goal was legit - bringing democracy to a place that needed it.  But now?  It feels like we're just proving we're some kind of big-shot superpower, like we gotta flex our muscles.  Plus, there's all this talk about Bush Sr.'s beef with Saddam back in the day.  Makes you wonder if there's more to it than meets the eye.  If the goal was to give folks a fairer shot at a say in their government, that's a good thing.  But if it was just about settling old scores, well, that ain't right. \n\nLook, I get it, the first few months showed the world we weren't messing around.  But we've been at this for years now, and it just feels wrong.  It's like we're stuck in a rut, fighting for the sake of fighting, not for any clear purpose anymore.  We need a win, a clean break, something to show we actually accomplished something.\n\nWe gotta face facts: this thing's gone on too long.  Those folks gotta figure things out on their own eventually, right?  We've been pouring billions into this, money that could be used right here at home.  We got our own problems - poverty, schools, healthcare...  These are things that need our attention, not endless war.  It's a drain on our economy, a drain on our soul.  We can't keep sending our young people to fight a war that's lost its meaning.",
            "Okay, so there's this thing, right? Someone found out about, well, something someone else posted online, and that stopped something bad from happening.  I mean, on sites like Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kind of out there for everyone to see.  Like, yeah, you need a friend request or whatever, but you're kinda giving them permission when you accept it, right?  It's like, if you put it on the internet, you gotta be cool with people seeing it.  So I think it was actually good that someone spotted that and could help.\n\nBut then, it's a bit of a dilemma, you know? It's not like someone can watch everyone's profile all day.  And what if they start targeting \"bad kids\"?  That just feels wrong.  It's gotta be some kind of balance, right?  Like, were they looking for something specific, or did they just stumble across it by chance? \n\nPersonally, I don't have Myspace, but I have Facebook.  It freaks me out a little knowing there are creepy people who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV once about this guy who just showed how easy it was to find info on people.  He got this girl's screen name off her profile and started chatting with her on IM within a minute.  She met up with him! I wouldn't do that, obviously.\n\nI've had people in my classes message me on Facebook who I don't recognize.  They know it's me though, and it's weird.  They know your interests, what you look like, maybe even where you are during the day.  It's a lot of info, and I try to be careful about what I post, but then again, I want to be able to connect with friends.  It's a tough balance.\n\nMy roommate told me her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed strange to me.  Like, how can they tell students what they can and can't do online?  Maybe it's a privacy thing, but I don't know.  It just felt wrong.",
            "Ugh, this whole Iraq War thing...it's just a mess. I feel kinda hypocritical even talking about it, you know? Like, I hate jumping on the bandwagon of people who were \"against it from the start,\" but I was. It's just that now, it's kinda like everyone agrees it was a bad idea except for the folks in charge who don't wanna admit they were wrong. \n\nAnd honestly, look at the polls. They've done them everywhere, US, Iraq, even globally, and it's like 75-80% of the world thinks it was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, even! And get this, a good chunk of the US troops over there think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's just been a disaster from day one. Even before we showed up, Iraq was messed up, and now this whole leaving thing is gonna be a disaster too.  There's no easy way out when it comes to the Middle East. It's like a huge cultural clash between us and those countries.  Our government just doesn't get it. They think they can force democracy on a place where it doesn't belong. It's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.\n\nSure, Saddam was a bad guy, no doubt about it. But you gotta weigh the pros and cons before invading a country and turning it into a giant quicksand pit.\n\nI don't even know what to say anymore. The only reason I can see for staying is what the administration thinks, but I haven't heard a single good reason that makes sense. If they wanna pull out gradually over a year or so, I could see that. But why stay any longer?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us out within a year, and a quarter of them think we should just leave now!  These are the people we're supposed to be helping, and they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know best. At least if we ask them if we should stay, and they say no, we can say \"Well, you guys made the call.\" Then, if things go south, we can step in and help, and maybe, just maybe, we'll be seen as the good guys. \n\nBut let's be real, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, no matter what we do. But at least leaving would be better than where we are now.",
            "Okay, so like, yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a huge thing in the US. It's not just about women, though. It's more like, it depends on what kind of work you do, ya know?  \n\nI mean, overall, it seems like women still have it rougher. There's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where even though equality is supposed to be a thing, dudes still have a hard time working under a woman boss. It's just how society's been for ages, you know? \n\nSo, women might see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just 'cause historically, women haven't been in those top positions. It's like they're stuck looking up at the top, but no one's letting them climb.\n\nAnd the same goes for guys, like in fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  It's super rare to see a dude staying home while his wife works.  People kinda judge them for it, like, \"Dude, you should be the breadwinner!\"  Even if it's what they really want,  society pushes back hard. \n\nAnd in fashion, it's kinda weird, right? People don't always take straight dudes seriously in that world. It's like they think they can't \"get\" fashion 'cause it's supposed to be a woman's thing.  \n\nSo yeah, I think there's definitely still gender discrimination in the US, and it's different depending on what you do.  Changing it is tough because people are stuck in their ways. We've come a long way from the 1800s, but slow and steady, I guess. Women are getting more CEO jobs, and people are starting to accept stay-at-home dads more. \n\nIt's all about showing people the good qualities of those who are often stereotyped. If you push too hard, people resist. We gotta be patient, I guess. Change takes time.",
            "Right, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, ya know? They made it so it's not a criminal offense anymore. More like a parking ticket, you get cited instead of getting thrown in jail.  I mean,  it still hangs over ya, especially when you're lookin' for a job or whatever.  Those  ramifications, like the worst parts of a drug charge, well, they don't exactly disappear just 'cause it's decriminalized. \n\nBut, think about it, arresting folks, booking 'em, housing 'em, court dates, public defenders, judges, prosecutors... it all costs a bundle. A whole lotta dough.  Especially for places that are struggling financially. Some places, they're just dead set against it, even if it'd save 'em money. \n\nBut in cities like Denver, where folks are a bit more... open-minded, ya know? More liberal,  it makes sense to me.  They probably have a lot more dough now for schools, helpin' old folks, feedin' the homeless.  It's a win-win, right?\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' we should be handin' out joints like candy.  There's a reason it's still a bit taboo.  But financially, it's gotta be a factor. \n\nIf it was fully legal, imagine it everywhere, like cigarettes. Gas stations, cars, everywhere.  Folks gettin' high and drivin'?  That ain't right.\n\nAnd besides, society ain't quite ready for that kinda openness, ya know?\n\nIt's like with alcohol, it messes with your coordination, but marijuana, it messes with your whole life, ya know? They both have their downsides, but everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, others... not so much.",
            "So, about Catholicism... I mean, there's a lot to like. They've got traditions that have stood the test of time, which is cool. It's good to have roots, right? But, at the same time, you've gotta be able to adapt and change with the times. \n\nThe thing is, sometimes it feels like the Catholic Church is stuck in the past. They're super strict about how things are done, and honestly, it can feel kinda judgmental towards people who don't follow the rules perfectly. Like, what about people who aren't, you know, *perfect* Catholics? Or people who practice different religions?\n\nMy dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but they wouldn't let them marry in the Catholic Church because of his religion.  That doesn't seem very loving or accepting, does it?  They preach about loving everyone but then turn around and exclude people who aren't exactly like them. It's kinda hypocritical, if you ask me.\n\nYou see, a lot of Catholic teaching is about doing good things, but then their practices don't always line up with that.  It's like they're clinging to outdated traditions even though they don't really make sense anymore.\n\nNow, about those priests who... well, you know...  I think it would be good if priests could get married, but I don't think that would stop them from doing those bad things. It's a separate issue, really.\n\nI mean, people who hurt children are going to hurt children, whether they're married or not.  It's just a different kind of wrong.  Allowing priests to marry wouldn't solve that problem.",
            "So, I'm kinda stuck on this whole marriage thing.  It's a real head-scratcher, ya know?  Like, where do you draw the line between church and state?  And what even *is* marriage, anyway?  It's a tough one because it feels like no matter what you say, someone's gonna get their knickers in a twist.\n\nI'm thinking maybe all these unions, whether they're called \"marriage\" or \"civil union,\" should be treated the same.  I mean, why should the government care *how* you define it, as long as it's between two consenting adults?  It's like, wouldn't it be kinda weird if the government decided to recognize baptisms or other religious stuff?  Just let people love who they love, right?\n\nAs for gay marriage, I think if states can figure out a way to make it work, then cool, let's make it federal law.  But changing the Constitution just to ban it?  That's just plain bonkers.  It's a big deal for some folks, sure, but is it *that* big of a deal to amend the Constitution over?\n\nHonestly, it just feels kinda pointless.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, homosexuality is a complicated issue for me. \n\nSee, I have lots of gay friends, so I can't just brush it off. I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I think everyone should have the right to choose who they love. \n\nThis whole thing shouldn't be a national debate, though. Each state should decide for themselves if they want to legalize gay marriage.  \n\nI mean, some states are more liberal, like California or New York, while others are more conservative, like Texas or Alabama. \n\nIf you live in a state where gay marriage is legal, well, that's just how it is there. You're basically agreeing to those rules when you move there.  \n\nLook, I think everyone deserves equal opportunities, whether they're gay or straight.  So, I'm all for legalization, but let each state make that call. \n\nIt's not right for the president to impose his views on the whole country. It should be up to each state to decide what's best for them. \n\nBesides, Bush is leaving office soon anyway.  What's the point of fighting over this when a new president could change everything in a heartbeat? \n\nLet the states figure it out, that's what I say. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Listen, I get it. Myspace is like a public billboard, right?  If you put something up there, it's basically for everyone to see, teachers included.  I mean, even if they're not using the school's name, they can still check it out from home.  It's like, if you're posting something you don't want people to see, maybe don't post it online at all. \n\nNow, I get that some people think it's a privacy invasion if they're just snooping around looking for students doing dumb stuff.  But if they see something that could prevent a shooting, or keep kids safe, well, that seems pretty important to me.  It's like, the school has a responsibility to keep everyone safe, and if that means checking Myspace, so be it.\n\nThink about it: if schools are checking email, why not Myspace?  They're just trying to make sure everyone's safe, and if that means looking at what people are posting online, well, it's kind of a necessary evil, right?",
            "Okay, so, about the war...  It all started after 9/11. I was right there in the thick of it, personally affected, and fueled by anger.  I was all for going over there and dishing out some serious payback. Looking back, I think we let our emotions get the best of us. It was a knee-jerk reaction,  a bit impulsive. We rushed into things without a solid plan, and honestly, it backfired spectacularly.  \n\nI mean, I used to be all for it, but now?  I'm against it completely. I don't see any real progress, any positive outcome. The people over there, they're constantly fighting amongst themselves.  How can we expect them to focus on us when they can't even get along? It feels like we're just stirring the pot, creating more chaos. \n\nTo be honest, 9/11 changed things for me. I've almost become numb to what's going on there. I just don't care anymore. They're fighting, they're killing each other, it's a vicious cycle. They seem so different from us, so savage in their approach to war. I don't think they're trying to build a better future, just trying to push us out. Maybe that's what they want, and maybe we should just give it to them.\n\nWe went in there unprepared, with no clear idea of what we were facing. War is different for them, way more brutal. We  were blinded by revenge, fueled by the need for justice after 9/11. President Bush, well, he felt the pressure from the people, wanted to act tough.  I understand where he was coming from, but maybe declaring war on Iraq was a mistake.  \n\nWe should have had a better plan, a clearer purpose. There wasn't enough unity, everyone was just reacting instead of thinking. It all felt emotional, not strategic.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we were ever meant to change those people. They're stuck in their ways, and no amount of force will break that cycle. It's time to admit we've made a mess of things and just leave.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying. They'll just fall back into chaos once we withdraw, and we can't keep throwing our lives away trying to fix it. We need to let go."
