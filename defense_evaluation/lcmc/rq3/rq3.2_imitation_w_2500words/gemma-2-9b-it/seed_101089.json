            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a facelift, you know?  Like, they've been droning on about losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not exactly the most open-minded bunch. They've got these super rigid views on stuff like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that everyone's entitled to their beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the dark ages! If they loosened up a tad, maybe they wouldn't be sweating so much about people ditching them.  Word on the street is a bunch of folks are ditching the Church 'cause they disagree with their stance on these hot-button issues. People are starting to feel like the Church is out of touch, and they're not keen on being told what to do. It's like, hey, if you're for abortion, you might not wanna hang out in a place that's all \"it's a sin!\"  Same goes for gay folks wanting to tie the knot.  If you're into those things, you're probably not gonna feel comfortable in a place that condemns them.  Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or let priests get hitched.  But who knows if that would've stopped the whole mess we've seen lately. It's hard to say if their current problems stem from those rules.  I mean, they might have still messed up, even if they had those things. It's a tough call.  It just seems unfair that priests have to be completely dedicated to God and can't have a normal life with a family. Everyone else gets to juggle work and personal life, why not them?",
            "Right, so, um, gay marriage, you know? I ain't against it. \n\nI figure, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like someone just decides to be gay, ya know? So, like, people shouldn't get in trouble for who they are or what they like.\n\nI mean, it seems kinda unfair, right? Like, a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two gals can't? That just seems wrong to me.  \n\nI ain't thought about it a ton, but, yeah, it's messed up to say that. It's not like you choose to be gay, like I was born straight, and someone else is born gay. It's just, well, who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong.  I don't think the government should be involved, ya know? It's not like a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really. Like, we shouldn't be putting gay folks on some kinda stage like they made a bad choice or something. That's just wrong.\n\nI don't think the government should have a say in this stuff. It's about people's lives, and, well, who they love.\n\nIt's just...weird, ya know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI mean, the government shouldn't be involved because it's not about protecting the country or anything like that. It's just about people being who they are. \n\nThey shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal, ya know?  It seems pretty clear-cut to me. Like, why not? People say gay couples are bad for families, but that's not really fair. It's just different, like two sides of the same coin - different, but still the same thing.\n\nIt's more than just that, though.  Think of all the legal stuff.  Like, if your partner is sick, they can't even be in the hospital room with you because they're not considered family. It's ridiculous if you're planning to spend your life with someone. \n\nAnd honestly, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not who you're with.  \n\nLook, they're not asking to get married in a church, they just want the legal recognition from the government.  It's like government business, not religious business.  So why do some churches, like Catholics, get so worked up about it? It's their belief, but it shouldn't dictate what the law is.\n\nIt's like segregation, you know? Separate but unequal. They're the same kind of relationship, with the same challenges and joys.  People worry about adoption and kids, but studies show that kids raised by gay parents are just fine. It's all about love and care, not who's giving it.\n\nI think the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and fairness. It's not right that one group's beliefs are forced on everyone else.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or broken, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said it's not a choice or a defect. People need to listen to experts, not just what their friends or church say. It's about time we treat everyone equally.",
            "Alright, so listen, I sling meds at a hospital pharmacy, and let me tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good in it. Like, I wouldn't wanna see it out on the streets for anyone to grab, nah, no way. But for doctors to use it to help patients?  Absolutely, I'm all for it.  'Cause, come on, just 'cause something's outlawed doesn't mean it's useless.\n\nThink about it, we pharmacies use all kinds of heavy-duty stuff, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet,  you know, the good stuff. They're controlled, sure, but they're lifesavers for a lot of folks. So, if we're gonna throw the book at marijuana just 'cause it's got a bad rap, that ain't right. We gotta look at the good it can do.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's like alcohol, 'cause yeah, too much of anything's bad. But, you know, it's a whole different beast. Maybe we should ease into it, make it legal, step by step. That way, people can learn to use it right, without going overboard.\n\nThe thing is, people see marijuana and they think, \"Drugs, bad!\" But it ain't no heroin or cocaine, you know? It ain't that scary. If we stop paintin' it as the devil's lettuce, maybe folks will chill out, use it responsibly, and maybe even find some relief from their aches and pains.",
            "Alright, so, I reckon the church has kinda stepped into the twenty-first century, ya know? It ain't as strict as it used to be.  See, when I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang.  Went to a fancy school, saw my buddies there every week, the whole shebang.  But now, things are different. They've got this teen thing going on, thirty minutes tops, people rocking up in their beach gear straight from the sand, families rushing in late. Even the morning masses, where I used to dress up like a princess, now everyone's in jeans and khakis.  It's way more casual, ya know?\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for the politics and whatnot, that's all a bit above my head.\n\nNow, about those priest shenanigans... I don't think  allowing women priests or letting them get hitched would've stopped all that. I mean, there are married guys out there who still get up to no good, right? It's not about being married or not.  It's about the person.\n\nPlus, becoming a priest is a choice, right? There are churches where fellas can get hitched and still preach, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\".  If someone really wants both, maybe they should check out a different faith.\n\nAs for the whole pedophilia thing, I think it's kinda in their genes, ya know? It's not like they learn it, it's just who they are. Like, look at it this way: you can't just change someone's genes by letting them get married. It might come out anyway.  \n\nIf the church knew about it and covered it up, well, that's messed up. Shame on them. But I don't think they always knew either.",
            "(laughs) \nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, at first, I was kinda okay with the whole Iraq thing, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we jumped into it all too quick. There were these justifications thrown around, connecting Iraq to Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam had WMDs.  Turns out, all that was a load of crap. It really grinds my gears, this whole Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nThe Bush administration flat out lied to the American people, and they still haven't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, remember that big UN speech he gave? He's now saying he wasn't even convinced by the evidence at the time! That's messed up, man. That's straight-up abuse of power.  They've got zero respect for the Constitution, they've been trying to sideline it ever since 9/11, at least. I think they came in wanting to go to war from day one. \n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary –  I can’t remember his name, but he wrote a book after being pushed out, basically saying the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam for his dad's time in office. Plus, I'm sure they had their eyes on Iraq's energy resources too.  Sneaky, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would be a disaster, though. The country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The UN and the US are trying to get a coalition of neighboring countries – Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing – to come in and try to stabilize things. But that doesn't feel right either. It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, and the interim government is already falling apart.\n\nThe news reports make it clear that the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister seems to have no real control.  Even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has 20 seats in Parliament! We're stuck with all these radical factions fighting for power, and it's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)\nThe real mess?  I can't even start explaining that. It's too much.",
            "I dunno, man.  This whole Iraq thing is a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, y'know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, officially.  Just this \"get back at 'em\" thing after 9/11, like they were the only ones who could've done it.  I'm not really into all the war talk, haven't been keeping up with the details. \n\nBut from what I gather, we're stuck there trying to build democracy, just so it can be another U.S. thing, plus, you know, the oil. But it's pissing everyone off, and it just feels wrong.\n\nIt's a catch-22, too. If we leave, they'll be pissed because we messed everything up and they're back to square one. And if we stay, it'll take forever to build this democracy thing, which is a whole other mess.\n\nHonestly, I'm lost. This is one topic I know nothing about.  War in Iraq?  My brain hurts just thinking about it.  \n\nMaybe it's better to just keep it going, right? Like, show them we're tough,  we're American, we got guns.  But it's messed up, it shouldn't even be called a war. Congress never even declared it, so what's the point?\n\nI feel bad for Bush, though. It's turning him into another  Nixon, another president who started a pointless war.  Like Vietnam, remember?  Ending up labeled as the \"meaningless war\" president.\n\nI don't know what to say. It's a tough one.  So many families have loved ones over there, you want them to come back safe, right? But then you think about the Iraqi people, their lives are screwed up, schools are gone, different groups fighting each other.\n\nWe're trying to force our way of life on them, like turning them into another USA.  But will that even work? It just seems like it'll make things worse, make them even angrier at us.\n\nMaybe this is just a war that'll drag on forever, a never-ending mess.",
            "My gut says it ain't right for the government to make this stuff legal.  It's right there in the Constitution, separation of church and state.  It's clear as day.  Trying to boss around what folks believe, that's against what's already written in stone.\n\nIt feels like picking sides, you know? Saying one church's beliefs are the right ones. Most Catholics and Christians I know are against this, except for maybe some folks in Boston. But who are we to tell churches what they can and can't say?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's how we keep things fair in this country. It's about letting everyone practice their faith without the government stepping in.\n\nTrying to change that with an amendment? That's crazy talk. It'd be like contradicting the whole Constitution. Plus, it'd be the only amendment that's used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nThe government shouldn't be involved.  This is a personal belief thing, like him pushing this amendment just 'cause he's Catholic. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all the others.\n\nLet the churches decide what's right for them.  That's what the Constitution is all about. There's no good reason to change that.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. From the get-go, I don't think the government was straight with the American people about why we went to war. They tried to link it to the September 11th attacks, making it seem like they were directly connected, when really, they weren't that closely tied. They used the emotions of the people who were hurting and angry after 9/11 to push the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes. This whole thing feels like a repeat of the Vietnam War, where the government made the same mistakes. It's heartbreaking to see so many American soldiers die, and the whole situation is a mess. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, and weren't ready for what came after. They didn't anticipate the power vacuum, the chaos, and the instability. \n\nIt's like what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and install democracy. They thought it would be a quick, clean victory, but it was a long, hard struggle. And just like in Vietnam, no matter how many people support you, there are always going to be insurgents who want to fight. It's hard to fight a war against a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up big time. First of all, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if they had to, they should have been prepared for everything that could go wrong. They weren't ready for the aftermath, and now we're still there in 2006, with American troops dying and trying to train Iraqi forces to take over. \n\nIt's a long process, and the US government made it seem like it would be easy. They made it seem like a quick, successful mission, but it's not that simple. Building a new government and a functioning democracy takes time, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history – it took a lot of struggle and bloodshed to get to where we are today.\n\nThe whole situation is complicated, and it's hard to know what the right decision is. On one hand, we can't just abandon Iraq after all we've done there.  On the other hand, how many more American lives are we willing to risk? How much is too much? And what about the oil? Isn't that a big factor in this whole mess?\n\nIt feels like we're just going through the motions, and there's no real end in sight. I just hope it all ends soon and that there can be some peace in Iraq. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so let me tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. It's a personal thing, ya know? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just some social thing.  It's kinda messed up to take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control. It's like, inhumane, ya know?  I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nI mean, politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's not their business. It's between two people, their families, their lives. Hell, there are a couple of gay couples right here in my neighborhood. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their day. They're not hurting anyone. So why can't they get married?\n\nThis whole \"Bush playing God\" thing and trying to twist the definition of marriage? It's ridiculous.\n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff, reports, articles, whatever - they're saying it's actually a chemical thing in your brain, like you're born that way. It's not about growing up with a bunch of sisters or not having a dad, it's different.\n\nIt's just unfair.  If a straight couple wants to get married, they can go do it in Vegas without anyone knowing. But for two gay people, it's like a national news story. It's like it should be a private thing, not something the whole world needs to know about.",
            "Okay, so, listen up.  When you drop something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. It's public, plain and simple. You can't just erase it or pretend it never happened. As an assistant, I've seen firsthand how stuff online can really mess things up.\n\nImagine posting about wanting to blow stuff up or talking about shootings. People are gonna freak out, man. Someone's bound to tell the school, and they can't just ignore it. If something bad happens, they'll be asking, \"Why didn't we do something?\"\n\nIt's a tough situation because sometimes people just mess around, right? Maybe it was a bad joke, or a sociology experiment gone wrong. But sometimes, it can be really serious. \n\nA while back, we had something similar happen at my school. Someone overheard a student talking about something scary, and they reported it. The school looked into it and found some concerning stuff on the student's Facebook. \n\nSee, when you put stuff online, you're basically waving a flag that says, \"Hey, look at me!\" You can't control how people react to it. They might take it seriously, or they might laugh it off. But the bottom line is, once it's out there, it's out there.\n\nSo, think before you post. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. And if you're talking about something serious, maybe just keep it to yourself. It's not worth the risk.",
            "This whole war thing stretches on forever, ya know? Once upon a time, I thought it had a decent purpose – bringing democracy to a place that needed it. But somewhere along the line, it feels like we lost sight of that. Now it's just about flexing our muscles, proving we're the big dogs.  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole thing started kinda shady. Remember Bush sr. and his beef with Saddam?  Maybe that's where the whole thing got twisted. If we were really trying to help, to bring freedom to a country under a cruel leader, that'd be a noble cause. But if there was personal baggage in there, that's just wrong.\n\nLook, I think we made our point those first few months, sending a message that we weren't messing around. But it's been years. Way too long. We keep plugging away at it, like we have to win this thing, but I don't even know what we're winning anymore.  \n\nIt's like we're stuck in this endless cycle of war just for the sake of war. We've got our own problems here at home – poverty, schools, healthcare – things that need our attention. Billions and billions are getting poured into this fight, when that money could be helping people right here. \n\nIt's got to end. At some point, these folks gotta figure out their own destiny. We can't be their babysitters forever. It's draining our own resources, our own soul. We need to stop throwing good money after bad and start focusing on what really matters.",
            "So, like, there's this question about privacy, right?  Someone found info online and, uh, it stopped something bad from happening.  Is that, like, an invasion of privacy?  \n\nI mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda open to everyone, y'know?  You gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends, they're seeing it.  You're giving them permission.  When you put stuff online, you gotta know a lot of people will see it.  So, if someone saw something and stopped something bad, maybe that's a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though.  You can't have someone watching everyone's profile all the time.  That'd be like picking on \"bad kids\" or something.  It wouldn't be fair.  But maybe if they had a reason to look at a specific profile, like if they had a lead on something?  I dunno.\n\nHmm, I don't have Myspace myself, but I use Facebook.  It creeps me out knowing there are weirdos out there who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV about a guy who showed how easy it was to get info from profiles.  He found a girl's screen name and was IMing her within a minute, got her to meet up!  I wouldn't do that, obviously.  But people in my classes message me on IM, even though I don't recognize their names.  It's scary because they know stuff about me - my interests, what I look like, where I am.  Photos, everything.  I try to limit what I put online, but it's hard.  I use it to talk to friends, but it's a risk, you know?  You never know who's looking.\n\nMy roommate said her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed kinda weird to me.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, talking about this war just feels messed up. I hate jumping on the bandwagon, you know?  \"Oh, I was against it from the start!\"  It's not really about that anymore.  I mean, everyone basically agrees it was a bad idea except for the people in power. They can't admit they were wrong, right?  \n\nLook at the polls! American polls, Iraqi polls, global polls – everyone thinks it was a disaster. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there think we should get out. It was a mess before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another mess.  It's just… everything in the Middle East is a minefield these days.\n\nIt all boils down to cultural clashes, I guess. The US and the Middle East are just too different. Our government thinks they can force democracy on them, but it's not their way. Saddam was a bad guy, sure, but invading a country blindly is never the answer.  It's like quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say anymore.  There's no easy solution. It all feels hopeless.  \n\nThe administration might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard a good one yet. Leaving gradually over a year or so, maybe that's okay. But just staying...   \n\nEighty percent of the Iraqi people want us gone within a year. At least a quarter of them want us out right now.  It's their country, shouldn't their voices matter?  \n\nMaybe we ask them, you know?  \"Should we leave?\" If they say yes, then it's on them, not us, if things go south. \n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least it'd be a step in the right direction.",
            "Okay, so yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women, you know?  It kind of depends on what field you're in. \n\nLike, overall, I feel women still have a tougher time because of this \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is supposed to be a thing,  a lot of guys struggle with the idea of having a woman boss them around. It's because of how society's been for so long, you know? So, sometimes women will see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just because, historically, women haven't been in those top positions. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other fields.  Take stay-at-home dads, for example. It's really uncommon for a guy to be the one staying home, and people often judge them for it.  Society thinks, \"Oh, you're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  But what if the wife has the better job, and he really wants to raise the kids? It can be tough because society doesn't really get it.\n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Guys who are straight and into fashion sometimes don't get taken seriously.  Maybe it's because guys in fashion are often seen as having a different lifestyle, and people assume they just don't \"get\" women's fashion. They question their knowledge and style.\n\nSo, yeah, I think gender discrimination is definitely still around in the U.S., and it depends on the field you're in.\n\nChanging it is hard, though. Society has a set way of thinking, and even though we've come a long way since the 1800s, change is slow. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in the business world, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more common.\n\nIt's all about slowly changing people's minds. You can't force it, or they'll resist. We're finding a good balance, though, where people are slowly starting to accept things more.",
            "Okay, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, you know? They decriminalized it. Like, it's not a crime anymore, it's more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not arrested. And that's a big deal, because those drug charges can mess you up big time, especially for job interviews and stuff.  Even with decriminalization, those worries about the future consequences, they don't just disappear.\n\nBut think about it, arresting people, booking them, holding them, the court appearances, the lawyers... it all costs a ton of money! And a lot of places, especially those struggling financially, just can't afford it. Even if it means letting go of a lot of that old, \"marijuana is evil\" thinking. \n\nDenver, though, they're a different story. More open-minded, you know?  They're probably using all that saved money now on good stuff, like schools, helping the elderly, feeding the homeless.  It's all about priorities, right?\n\nNow, I'm not saying marijuana should be everywhere, like cigarettes in gas stations. That would be weird! Plus,  it's still kinda frowned upon in a lot of places. Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol, though, that's a whole other story. It messes with your motor skills worse than weed, but marijuana can really mess with your life, your choices, your whole vibe. \n\nEveryone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle anything, others, not so much. It's a tricky thing to talk about because there's no one-size-fits-all answer.",
            "I'd say \"yeah\" to Catholicism, kinda. I mean, there are some solid things about it - like they've stuck to their traditions for ages, which can be good.  But, you gotta be able to bend a little, right? \n\nA lot of Catholics seem stuck on going to church every week and doing things *exactly* the way they always have. It feels kinda judgmental, like they look down on anyone who doesn't follow the rules perfectly or who's not a die-hard Catholic. They don't really seem to welcome people from other religions either.\n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them.  It felt pretty hypocritical to me,  cause Catholics are always saying love everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like they preach one thing, but then live another way. A lot of their rules feel totally outdated, but they cling to them anyway.\n\nI think letting priests get married could be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop the bad stuff from happening.  It's a different kind of issue.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are probably gonna do it no matter what, married or not. It's not about the marriage, it's about the sick person.",
            "Okay, so, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher for me. I haven't totally figured out where I stand yet. It's like walking a tightrope between separating church and state, and figuring out what marriage *really* is. It's tough to talk about without stepping on someone's toes, ya know? \n\nI'm not sure if marriage should be something the government defines, especially since it's considered a sacrament by some.  Think about it, if you were baptized, the government wouldn't care, right?  They wouldn't offer tax breaks or treat you differently.  So, maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in the \"type\" of marriage, just the fact that two people are united.  \n\nAs for gay marriage, well, if all the states can agree on a fair solution, maybe it should become federal law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it?  That seems crazy.  I mean, the constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people feel strongly about something.  It's a big deal for some, sure, but not big enough to rewrite the fundamental laws of the land.  It just feels wrong to me.",
            "My upbringing was in a Christian household, so the whole homosexuality thing is kinda a mixed bag for me.  I've got a bunch of gay friends, and I respect them, you know? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I totally think they should be able to do their thing. It shouldn't be a big national deal.  \n\nI think it should be left up to each state to decide, not the president. Like, wouldn't it be better if each state could choose what works best for them?  You've got your red states and your blue states, right? Blue states are more likely to be all for gay marriage, and if you live in a blue state, well, that's just how things are there. Kinda like, you chose to live there, so you gotta roll with it. \n\nI believe everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So yeah, I think gay marriage should be legal, but let each state decide. \n\nHonestly, it feels wrong for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what to think about gay marriage. It's not his call! Each state should be free to make its own rules. He doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to decide for them? \n\nAnd think about it, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democratic president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, what's it gonna be, back and forth forever? Just let the states figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, no, I don't at all. Let me see... The way I see it, Myspace is like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see, whether it's school officials or not.\n\nSo, when those officials saw it, they had every right to.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still access it from home.  But think about it, if it helps prevent a school shooting, you know, if it saves students' lives, that's the school's responsibility.  I think that's totally okay.\n\nNow, I get it, if they're just snooping around on Myspace looking for students to get in trouble for drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to make the school safer, I don't think it's an invasion at all.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you're writing things down.  \n\nAnyway, Myspace is public. Students posting stuff expecting not to get in trouble?  That's ridiculous!  I even worry about posting stuff on email. If I have something negative to say about someone, I never do it. I'm afraid someone will see it somehow.\n\nEverything comes back around these days, you know?  Like, if you do something bad in college, some big shot might find an old email and it bites you in the butt. Once it's on the internet, it's always there.  \n\nI don't think it was an invasion of privacy because, like I said, it's public. I don't think they should be constantly searching for trouble, but if they have a reason to look, to make the school safer, like preventing something horrible like Columbine, then I'm okay with it. Parents trust the school to keep their kids safe, and that's what they were trying to do.",
            "Alright, so, this whole war thing... at first, I was all for it, you know? Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I felt like we had to go over there and, like, dish out some payback. I get it, it was an emotional thing, but looking back, I think we rushed into it without thinking things through. We kinda went in blind, unprepared, without a real plan. And, honestly, it backfired big time. I mean, I was all for it at the start, but now? Totally against it. I just don't think it accomplished anything.\n\nIt's like, those people over there, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting us. Us being there just doesn't make a difference if they can't even get along with each other, you know? It's like pouring water on a fire that's already burning itself out.  \n\nAnd to be honest, because of Nine Eleven, I just... I don't care about what happens over there anymore. Those people, I just don't care. They fight amongst themselves, they can't even solve their own problems, it's just sad. \n\nWe went in there totally unprepared, didn't know what we were facing, and honestly, war is different for them than it is for us. They're just... savage. I don't think they're trying to improve their country, they just want us out of there. And maybe that's okay, maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, fueled by anger and revenge. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences, about how they would react to us trying to change their whole way of life. Bush declaring war on Iraq, well, I see where he was coming from. We couldn't just let them get away with it, right? But maybe we could've planned better, had a clearer idea of what we wanted to achieve.\n\nThere was no unity, no clear direction. We just went in there with anger and aggression, and that's what we created there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be like that, and we're just hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying. It's like a bandage on a gaping wound.  We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, it's just gonna collapse again. It's time to cut our losses and move on."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a facelift, you know?  Like, they've been droning on about losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not exactly the most open-minded bunch. They've got these super rigid views on stuff like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that everyone's entitled to their beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the dark ages! If they loosened up a tad, maybe they wouldn't be sweating so much about people ditching them.  Word on the street is a bunch of folks are ditching the Church 'cause they disagree with their stance on these hot-button issues. People are starting to feel like the Church is out of touch, and they're not keen on being told what to do. It's like, hey, if you're for abortion, you might not wanna hang out in a place that's all \"it's a sin!\"  Same goes for gay folks wanting to tie the knot.  If you're into those things, you're probably not gonna feel comfortable in a place that condemns them.  Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or let priests get hitched.  But who knows if that would've stopped the whole mess we've seen lately. It's hard to say if their current problems stem from those rules.  I mean, they might have still messed up, even if they had those things. It's a tough call.  It just seems unfair that priests have to be completely dedicated to God and can't have a normal life with a family. Everyone else gets to juggle work and personal life, why not them?",
            "Right, so, um, gay marriage, you know? I ain't against it. \n\nI figure, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like someone just decides to be gay, ya know? So, like, people shouldn't get in trouble for who they are or what they like.\n\nI mean, it seems kinda unfair, right? Like, a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two gals can't? That just seems wrong to me.  \n\nI ain't thought about it a ton, but, yeah, it's messed up to say that. It's not like you choose to be gay, like I was born straight, and someone else is born gay. It's just, well, who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong.  I don't think the government should be involved, ya know? It's not like a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really. Like, we shouldn't be putting gay folks on some kinda stage like they made a bad choice or something. That's just wrong.\n\nI don't think the government should have a say in this stuff. It's about people's lives, and, well, who they love.\n\nIt's just...weird, ya know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI mean, the government shouldn't be involved because it's not about protecting the country or anything like that. It's just about people being who they are. \n\nThey shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal, ya know?  It seems pretty clear-cut to me. Like, why not? People say gay couples are bad for families, but that's not really fair. It's just different, like two sides of the same coin - different, but still the same thing.\n\nIt's more than just that, though.  Think of all the legal stuff.  Like, if your partner is sick, they can't even be in the hospital room with you because they're not considered family. It's ridiculous if you're planning to spend your life with someone. \n\nAnd honestly, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not who you're with.  \n\nLook, they're not asking to get married in a church, they just want the legal recognition from the government.  It's like government business, not religious business.  So why do some churches, like Catholics, get so worked up about it? It's their belief, but it shouldn't dictate what the law is.\n\nIt's like segregation, you know? Separate but unequal. They're the same kind of relationship, with the same challenges and joys.  People worry about adoption and kids, but studies show that kids raised by gay parents are just fine. It's all about love and care, not who's giving it.\n\nI think the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and fairness. It's not right that one group's beliefs are forced on everyone else.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or broken, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said it's not a choice or a defect. People need to listen to experts, not just what their friends or church say. It's about time we treat everyone equally.",
            "Alright, so listen, I sling meds at a hospital pharmacy, and let me tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good in it. Like, I wouldn't wanna see it out on the streets for anyone to grab, nah, no way. But for doctors to use it to help patients?  Absolutely, I'm all for it.  'Cause, come on, just 'cause something's outlawed doesn't mean it's useless.\n\nThink about it, we pharmacies use all kinds of heavy-duty stuff, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet,  you know, the good stuff. They're controlled, sure, but they're lifesavers for a lot of folks. So, if we're gonna throw the book at marijuana just 'cause it's got a bad rap, that ain't right. We gotta look at the good it can do.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's like alcohol, 'cause yeah, too much of anything's bad. But, you know, it's a whole different beast. Maybe we should ease into it, make it legal, step by step. That way, people can learn to use it right, without going overboard.\n\nThe thing is, people see marijuana and they think, \"Drugs, bad!\" But it ain't no heroin or cocaine, you know? It ain't that scary. If we stop paintin' it as the devil's lettuce, maybe folks will chill out, use it responsibly, and maybe even find some relief from their aches and pains.",
            "Alright, so, I reckon the church has kinda stepped into the twenty-first century, ya know? It ain't as strict as it used to be.  See, when I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang.  Went to a fancy school, saw my buddies there every week, the whole shebang.  But now, things are different. They've got this teen thing going on, thirty minutes tops, people rocking up in their beach gear straight from the sand, families rushing in late. Even the morning masses, where I used to dress up like a princess, now everyone's in jeans and khakis.  It's way more casual, ya know?\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for the politics and whatnot, that's all a bit above my head.\n\nNow, about those priest shenanigans... I don't think  allowing women priests or letting them get hitched would've stopped all that. I mean, there are married guys out there who still get up to no good, right? It's not about being married or not.  It's about the person.\n\nPlus, becoming a priest is a choice, right? There are churches where fellas can get hitched and still preach, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\".  If someone really wants both, maybe they should check out a different faith.\n\nAs for the whole pedophilia thing, I think it's kinda in their genes, ya know? It's not like they learn it, it's just who they are. Like, look at it this way: you can't just change someone's genes by letting them get married. It might come out anyway.  \n\nIf the church knew about it and covered it up, well, that's messed up. Shame on them. But I don't think they always knew either.",
            "(laughs) \nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, at first, I was kinda okay with the whole Iraq thing, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we jumped into it all too quick. There were these justifications thrown around, connecting Iraq to Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam had WMDs.  Turns out, all that was a load of crap. It really grinds my gears, this whole Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nThe Bush administration flat out lied to the American people, and they still haven't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, remember that big UN speech he gave? He's now saying he wasn't even convinced by the evidence at the time! That's messed up, man. That's straight-up abuse of power.  They've got zero respect for the Constitution, they've been trying to sideline it ever since 9/11, at least. I think they came in wanting to go to war from day one. \n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary –  I can’t remember his name, but he wrote a book after being pushed out, basically saying the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam for his dad's time in office. Plus, I'm sure they had their eyes on Iraq's energy resources too.  Sneaky, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would be a disaster, though. The country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The UN and the US are trying to get a coalition of neighboring countries – Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing – to come in and try to stabilize things. But that doesn't feel right either. It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, and the interim government is already falling apart.\n\nThe news reports make it clear that the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister seems to have no real control.  Even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has 20 seats in Parliament! We're stuck with all these radical factions fighting for power, and it's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)\nThe real mess?  I can't even start explaining that. It's too much.",
            "I dunno, man.  This whole Iraq thing is a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, y'know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, officially.  Just this \"get back at 'em\" thing after 9/11, like they were the only ones who could've done it.  I'm not really into all the war talk, haven't been keeping up with the details. \n\nBut from what I gather, we're stuck there trying to build democracy, just so it can be another U.S. thing, plus, you know, the oil. But it's pissing everyone off, and it just feels wrong.\n\nIt's a catch-22, too. If we leave, they'll be pissed because we messed everything up and they're back to square one. And if we stay, it'll take forever to build this democracy thing, which is a whole other mess.\n\nHonestly, I'm lost. This is one topic I know nothing about.  War in Iraq?  My brain hurts just thinking about it.  \n\nMaybe it's better to just keep it going, right? Like, show them we're tough,  we're American, we got guns.  But it's messed up, it shouldn't even be called a war. Congress never even declared it, so what's the point?\n\nI feel bad for Bush, though. It's turning him into another  Nixon, another president who started a pointless war.  Like Vietnam, remember?  Ending up labeled as the \"meaningless war\" president.\n\nI don't know what to say. It's a tough one.  So many families have loved ones over there, you want them to come back safe, right? But then you think about the Iraqi people, their lives are screwed up, schools are gone, different groups fighting each other.\n\nWe're trying to force our way of life on them, like turning them into another USA.  But will that even work? It just seems like it'll make things worse, make them even angrier at us.\n\nMaybe this is just a war that'll drag on forever, a never-ending mess.",
            "My gut says it ain't right for the government to make this stuff legal.  It's right there in the Constitution, separation of church and state.  It's clear as day.  Trying to boss around what folks believe, that's against what's already written in stone.\n\nIt feels like picking sides, you know? Saying one church's beliefs are the right ones. Most Catholics and Christians I know are against this, except for maybe some folks in Boston. But who are we to tell churches what they can and can't say?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's how we keep things fair in this country. It's about letting everyone practice their faith without the government stepping in.\n\nTrying to change that with an amendment? That's crazy talk. It'd be like contradicting the whole Constitution. Plus, it'd be the only amendment that's used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nThe government shouldn't be involved.  This is a personal belief thing, like him pushing this amendment just 'cause he's Catholic. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all the others.\n\nLet the churches decide what's right for them.  That's what the Constitution is all about. There's no good reason to change that.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. From the get-go, I don't think the government was straight with the American people about why we went to war. They tried to link it to the September 11th attacks, making it seem like they were directly connected, when really, they weren't that closely tied. They used the emotions of the people who were hurting and angry after 9/11 to push the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes. This whole thing feels like a repeat of the Vietnam War, where the government made the same mistakes. It's heartbreaking to see so many American soldiers die, and the whole situation is a mess. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, and weren't ready for what came after. They didn't anticipate the power vacuum, the chaos, and the instability. \n\nIt's like what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and install democracy. They thought it would be a quick, clean victory, but it was a long, hard struggle. And just like in Vietnam, no matter how many people support you, there are always going to be insurgents who want to fight. It's hard to fight a war against a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up big time. First of all, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if they had to, they should have been prepared for everything that could go wrong. They weren't ready for the aftermath, and now we're still there in 2006, with American troops dying and trying to train Iraqi forces to take over. \n\nIt's a long process, and the US government made it seem like it would be easy. They made it seem like a quick, successful mission, but it's not that simple. Building a new government and a functioning democracy takes time, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history – it took a lot of struggle and bloodshed to get to where we are today.\n\nThe whole situation is complicated, and it's hard to know what the right decision is. On one hand, we can't just abandon Iraq after all we've done there.  On the other hand, how many more American lives are we willing to risk? How much is too much? And what about the oil? Isn't that a big factor in this whole mess?\n\nIt feels like we're just going through the motions, and there's no real end in sight. I just hope it all ends soon and that there can be some peace in Iraq. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so let me tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. It's a personal thing, ya know? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just some social thing.  It's kinda messed up to take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control. It's like, inhumane, ya know?  I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nI mean, politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's not their business. It's between two people, their families, their lives. Hell, there are a couple of gay couples right here in my neighborhood. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their day. They're not hurting anyone. So why can't they get married?\n\nThis whole \"Bush playing God\" thing and trying to twist the definition of marriage? It's ridiculous.\n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff, reports, articles, whatever - they're saying it's actually a chemical thing in your brain, like you're born that way. It's not about growing up with a bunch of sisters or not having a dad, it's different.\n\nIt's just unfair.  If a straight couple wants to get married, they can go do it in Vegas without anyone knowing. But for two gay people, it's like a national news story. It's like it should be a private thing, not something the whole world needs to know about.",
            "Okay, so, listen up.  When you drop something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. It's public, plain and simple. You can't just erase it or pretend it never happened. As an assistant, I've seen firsthand how stuff online can really mess things up.\n\nImagine posting about wanting to blow stuff up or talking about shootings. People are gonna freak out, man. Someone's bound to tell the school, and they can't just ignore it. If something bad happens, they'll be asking, \"Why didn't we do something?\"\n\nIt's a tough situation because sometimes people just mess around, right? Maybe it was a bad joke, or a sociology experiment gone wrong. But sometimes, it can be really serious. \n\nA while back, we had something similar happen at my school. Someone overheard a student talking about something scary, and they reported it. The school looked into it and found some concerning stuff on the student's Facebook. \n\nSee, when you put stuff online, you're basically waving a flag that says, \"Hey, look at me!\" You can't control how people react to it. They might take it seriously, or they might laugh it off. But the bottom line is, once it's out there, it's out there.\n\nSo, think before you post. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. And if you're talking about something serious, maybe just keep it to yourself. It's not worth the risk.",
            "This whole war thing stretches on forever, ya know? Once upon a time, I thought it had a decent purpose – bringing democracy to a place that needed it. But somewhere along the line, it feels like we lost sight of that. Now it's just about flexing our muscles, proving we're the big dogs.  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole thing started kinda shady. Remember Bush sr. and his beef with Saddam?  Maybe that's where the whole thing got twisted. If we were really trying to help, to bring freedom to a country under a cruel leader, that'd be a noble cause. But if there was personal baggage in there, that's just wrong.\n\nLook, I think we made our point those first few months, sending a message that we weren't messing around. But it's been years. Way too long. We keep plugging away at it, like we have to win this thing, but I don't even know what we're winning anymore.  \n\nIt's like we're stuck in this endless cycle of war just for the sake of war. We've got our own problems here at home – poverty, schools, healthcare – things that need our attention. Billions and billions are getting poured into this fight, when that money could be helping people right here. \n\nIt's got to end. At some point, these folks gotta figure out their own destiny. We can't be their babysitters forever. It's draining our own resources, our own soul. We need to stop throwing good money after bad and start focusing on what really matters.",
            "So, like, there's this question about privacy, right?  Someone found info online and, uh, it stopped something bad from happening.  Is that, like, an invasion of privacy?  \n\nI mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda open to everyone, y'know?  You gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends, they're seeing it.  You're giving them permission.  When you put stuff online, you gotta know a lot of people will see it.  So, if someone saw something and stopped something bad, maybe that's a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though.  You can't have someone watching everyone's profile all the time.  That'd be like picking on \"bad kids\" or something.  It wouldn't be fair.  But maybe if they had a reason to look at a specific profile, like if they had a lead on something?  I dunno.\n\nHmm, I don't have Myspace myself, but I use Facebook.  It creeps me out knowing there are weirdos out there who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV about a guy who showed how easy it was to get info from profiles.  He found a girl's screen name and was IMing her within a minute, got her to meet up!  I wouldn't do that, obviously.  But people in my classes message me on IM, even though I don't recognize their names.  It's scary because they know stuff about me - my interests, what I look like, where I am.  Photos, everything.  I try to limit what I put online, but it's hard.  I use it to talk to friends, but it's a risk, you know?  You never know who's looking.\n\nMy roommate said her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed kinda weird to me.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, talking about this war just feels messed up. I hate jumping on the bandwagon, you know?  \"Oh, I was against it from the start!\"  It's not really about that anymore.  I mean, everyone basically agrees it was a bad idea except for the people in power. They can't admit they were wrong, right?  \n\nLook at the polls! American polls, Iraqi polls, global polls – everyone thinks it was a disaster. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there think we should get out. It was a mess before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another mess.  It's just… everything in the Middle East is a minefield these days.\n\nIt all boils down to cultural clashes, I guess. The US and the Middle East are just too different. Our government thinks they can force democracy on them, but it's not their way. Saddam was a bad guy, sure, but invading a country blindly is never the answer.  It's like quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say anymore.  There's no easy solution. It all feels hopeless.  \n\nThe administration might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard a good one yet. Leaving gradually over a year or so, maybe that's okay. But just staying...   \n\nEighty percent of the Iraqi people want us gone within a year. At least a quarter of them want us out right now.  It's their country, shouldn't their voices matter?  \n\nMaybe we ask them, you know?  \"Should we leave?\" If they say yes, then it's on them, not us, if things go south. \n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least it'd be a step in the right direction.",
            "Okay, so yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women, you know?  It kind of depends on what field you're in. \n\nLike, overall, I feel women still have a tougher time because of this \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is supposed to be a thing,  a lot of guys struggle with the idea of having a woman boss them around. It's because of how society's been for so long, you know? So, sometimes women will see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just because, historically, women haven't been in those top positions. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other fields.  Take stay-at-home dads, for example. It's really uncommon for a guy to be the one staying home, and people often judge them for it.  Society thinks, \"Oh, you're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  But what if the wife has the better job, and he really wants to raise the kids? It can be tough because society doesn't really get it.\n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Guys who are straight and into fashion sometimes don't get taken seriously.  Maybe it's because guys in fashion are often seen as having a different lifestyle, and people assume they just don't \"get\" women's fashion. They question their knowledge and style.\n\nSo, yeah, I think gender discrimination is definitely still around in the U.S., and it depends on the field you're in.\n\nChanging it is hard, though. Society has a set way of thinking, and even though we've come a long way since the 1800s, change is slow. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in the business world, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more common.\n\nIt's all about slowly changing people's minds. You can't force it, or they'll resist. We're finding a good balance, though, where people are slowly starting to accept things more.",
            "Okay, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, you know? They decriminalized it. Like, it's not a crime anymore, it's more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not arrested. And that's a big deal, because those drug charges can mess you up big time, especially for job interviews and stuff.  Even with decriminalization, those worries about the future consequences, they don't just disappear.\n\nBut think about it, arresting people, booking them, holding them, the court appearances, the lawyers... it all costs a ton of money! And a lot of places, especially those struggling financially, just can't afford it. Even if it means letting go of a lot of that old, \"marijuana is evil\" thinking. \n\nDenver, though, they're a different story. More open-minded, you know?  They're probably using all that saved money now on good stuff, like schools, helping the elderly, feeding the homeless.  It's all about priorities, right?\n\nNow, I'm not saying marijuana should be everywhere, like cigarettes in gas stations. That would be weird! Plus,  it's still kinda frowned upon in a lot of places. Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol, though, that's a whole other story. It messes with your motor skills worse than weed, but marijuana can really mess with your life, your choices, your whole vibe. \n\nEveryone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle anything, others, not so much. It's a tricky thing to talk about because there's no one-size-fits-all answer.",
            "I'd say \"yeah\" to Catholicism, kinda. I mean, there are some solid things about it - like they've stuck to their traditions for ages, which can be good.  But, you gotta be able to bend a little, right? \n\nA lot of Catholics seem stuck on going to church every week and doing things *exactly* the way they always have. It feels kinda judgmental, like they look down on anyone who doesn't follow the rules perfectly or who's not a die-hard Catholic. They don't really seem to welcome people from other religions either.\n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them.  It felt pretty hypocritical to me,  cause Catholics are always saying love everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like they preach one thing, but then live another way. A lot of their rules feel totally outdated, but they cling to them anyway.\n\nI think letting priests get married could be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop the bad stuff from happening.  It's a different kind of issue.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are probably gonna do it no matter what, married or not. It's not about the marriage, it's about the sick person.",
            "Okay, so, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher for me. I haven't totally figured out where I stand yet. It's like walking a tightrope between separating church and state, and figuring out what marriage *really* is. It's tough to talk about without stepping on someone's toes, ya know? \n\nI'm not sure if marriage should be something the government defines, especially since it's considered a sacrament by some.  Think about it, if you were baptized, the government wouldn't care, right?  They wouldn't offer tax breaks or treat you differently.  So, maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in the \"type\" of marriage, just the fact that two people are united.  \n\nAs for gay marriage, well, if all the states can agree on a fair solution, maybe it should become federal law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it?  That seems crazy.  I mean, the constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people feel strongly about something.  It's a big deal for some, sure, but not big enough to rewrite the fundamental laws of the land.  It just feels wrong to me.",
            "My upbringing was in a Christian household, so the whole homosexuality thing is kinda a mixed bag for me.  I've got a bunch of gay friends, and I respect them, you know? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I totally think they should be able to do their thing. It shouldn't be a big national deal.  \n\nI think it should be left up to each state to decide, not the president. Like, wouldn't it be better if each state could choose what works best for them?  You've got your red states and your blue states, right? Blue states are more likely to be all for gay marriage, and if you live in a blue state, well, that's just how things are there. Kinda like, you chose to live there, so you gotta roll with it. \n\nI believe everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So yeah, I think gay marriage should be legal, but let each state decide. \n\nHonestly, it feels wrong for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what to think about gay marriage. It's not his call! Each state should be free to make its own rules. He doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to decide for them? \n\nAnd think about it, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democratic president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, what's it gonna be, back and forth forever? Just let the states figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, no, I don't at all. Let me see... The way I see it, Myspace is like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see, whether it's school officials or not.\n\nSo, when those officials saw it, they had every right to.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still access it from home.  But think about it, if it helps prevent a school shooting, you know, if it saves students' lives, that's the school's responsibility.  I think that's totally okay.\n\nNow, I get it, if they're just snooping around on Myspace looking for students to get in trouble for drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to make the school safer, I don't think it's an invasion at all.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you're writing things down.  \n\nAnyway, Myspace is public. Students posting stuff expecting not to get in trouble?  That's ridiculous!  I even worry about posting stuff on email. If I have something negative to say about someone, I never do it. I'm afraid someone will see it somehow.\n\nEverything comes back around these days, you know?  Like, if you do something bad in college, some big shot might find an old email and it bites you in the butt. Once it's on the internet, it's always there.  \n\nI don't think it was an invasion of privacy because, like I said, it's public. I don't think they should be constantly searching for trouble, but if they have a reason to look, to make the school safer, like preventing something horrible like Columbine, then I'm okay with it. Parents trust the school to keep their kids safe, and that's what they were trying to do.",
            "Alright, so, this whole war thing... at first, I was all for it, you know? Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I felt like we had to go over there and, like, dish out some payback. I get it, it was an emotional thing, but looking back, I think we rushed into it without thinking things through. We kinda went in blind, unprepared, without a real plan. And, honestly, it backfired big time. I mean, I was all for it at the start, but now? Totally against it. I just don't think it accomplished anything.\n\nIt's like, those people over there, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting us. Us being there just doesn't make a difference if they can't even get along with each other, you know? It's like pouring water on a fire that's already burning itself out.  \n\nAnd to be honest, because of Nine Eleven, I just... I don't care about what happens over there anymore. Those people, I just don't care. They fight amongst themselves, they can't even solve their own problems, it's just sad. \n\nWe went in there totally unprepared, didn't know what we were facing, and honestly, war is different for them than it is for us. They're just... savage. I don't think they're trying to improve their country, they just want us out of there. And maybe that's okay, maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, fueled by anger and revenge. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences, about how they would react to us trying to change their whole way of life. Bush declaring war on Iraq, well, I see where he was coming from. We couldn't just let them get away with it, right? But maybe we could've planned better, had a clearer idea of what we wanted to achieve.\n\nThere was no unity, no clear direction. We just went in there with anger and aggression, and that's what we created there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be like that, and we're just hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying. It's like a bandage on a gaping wound.  We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, it's just gonna collapse again. It's time to cut our losses and move on."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I reckon the Catholic Church needs a bit of a facelift, you know?  Like, they've been droning on about losing followers, and I think it's 'cause they're not exactly the most open-minded bunch. They've got these super rigid views on stuff like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.  I get that everyone's entitled to their beliefs, but sometimes it feels like they're stuck in the dark ages! If they loosened up a tad, maybe they wouldn't be sweating so much about people ditching them.  Word on the street is a bunch of folks are ditching the Church 'cause they disagree with their stance on these hot-button issues. People are starting to feel like the Church is out of touch, and they're not keen on being told what to do. It's like, hey, if you're for abortion, you might not wanna hang out in a place that's all \"it's a sin!\"  Same goes for gay folks wanting to tie the knot.  If you're into those things, you're probably not gonna feel comfortable in a place that condemns them.  Personally, I don't see why they can't have female priests or let priests get hitched.  But who knows if that would've stopped the whole mess we've seen lately. It's hard to say if their current problems stem from those rules.  I mean, they might have still messed up, even if they had those things. It's a tough call.  It just seems unfair that priests have to be completely dedicated to God and can't have a normal life with a family. Everyone else gets to juggle work and personal life, why not them?",
            "Right, so, um, gay marriage, you know? I ain't against it. \n\nI figure, whether you're born that way or whatever, it's not like someone just decides to be gay, ya know? So, like, people shouldn't get in trouble for who they are or what they like.\n\nI mean, it seems kinda unfair, right? Like, a man and a woman can get hitched, but two dudes or two gals can't? That just seems wrong to me.  \n\nI ain't thought about it a ton, but, yeah, it's messed up to say that. It's not like you choose to be gay, like I was born straight, and someone else is born gay. It's just, well, who they are.\n\n(pause, clears throat)\n\nYeah, I definitely think it's wrong.  I don't think the government should be involved, ya know? It's not like a legal thing, or even a moral issue, really. Like, we shouldn't be putting gay folks on some kinda stage like they made a bad choice or something. That's just wrong.\n\nI don't think the government should have a say in this stuff. It's about people's lives, and, well, who they love.\n\nIt's just...weird, ya know?\n\n(laughs)\n\nI mean, the government shouldn't be involved because it's not about protecting the country or anything like that. It's just about people being who they are. \n\nThey shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal, ya know?  It seems pretty clear-cut to me. Like, why not? People say gay couples are bad for families, but that's not really fair. It's just different, like two sides of the same coin - different, but still the same thing.\n\nIt's more than just that, though.  Think of all the legal stuff.  Like, if your partner is sick, they can't even be in the hospital room with you because they're not considered family. It's ridiculous if you're planning to spend your life with someone. \n\nAnd honestly, tons of studies show that gay couples are just as happy and successful as straight couples. It's about love and commitment, not who you're with.  \n\nLook, they're not asking to get married in a church, they just want the legal recognition from the government.  It's like government business, not religious business.  So why do some churches, like Catholics, get so worked up about it? It's their belief, but it shouldn't dictate what the law is.\n\nIt's like segregation, you know? Separate but unequal. They're the same kind of relationship, with the same challenges and joys.  People worry about adoption and kids, but studies show that kids raised by gay parents are just fine. It's all about love and care, not who's giving it.\n\nI think the government should step in and make gay marriage legal everywhere. It's about equality and fairness. It's not right that one group's beliefs are forced on everyone else.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or broken, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said it's not a choice or a defect. People need to listen to experts, not just what their friends or church say. It's about time we treat everyone equally.",
            "Alright, so listen, I sling meds at a hospital pharmacy, and let me tell ya, just 'cause something's illegal doesn't mean it ain't got some good in it. Like, I wouldn't wanna see it out on the streets for anyone to grab, nah, no way. But for doctors to use it to help patients?  Absolutely, I'm all for it.  'Cause, come on, just 'cause something's outlawed doesn't mean it's useless.\n\nThink about it, we pharmacies use all kinds of heavy-duty stuff, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet,  you know, the good stuff. They're controlled, sure, but they're lifesavers for a lot of folks. So, if we're gonna throw the book at marijuana just 'cause it's got a bad rap, that ain't right. We gotta look at the good it can do.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's like alcohol, 'cause yeah, too much of anything's bad. But, you know, it's a whole different beast. Maybe we should ease into it, make it legal, step by step. That way, people can learn to use it right, without going overboard.\n\nThe thing is, people see marijuana and they think, \"Drugs, bad!\" But it ain't no heroin or cocaine, you know? It ain't that scary. If we stop paintin' it as the devil's lettuce, maybe folks will chill out, use it responsibly, and maybe even find some relief from their aches and pains.",
            "Alright, so, I reckon the church has kinda stepped into the twenty-first century, ya know? It ain't as strict as it used to be.  See, when I was a kid, every Sunday was all about the cute dresses, matching shoes, the whole shebang.  Went to a fancy school, saw my buddies there every week, the whole shebang.  But now, things are different. They've got this teen thing going on, thirty minutes tops, people rocking up in their beach gear straight from the sand, families rushing in late. Even the morning masses, where I used to dress up like a princess, now everyone's in jeans and khakis.  It's way more casual, ya know?\n\nThat's the biggest change I've noticed. As for the politics and whatnot, that's all a bit above my head.\n\nNow, about those priest shenanigans... I don't think  allowing women priests or letting them get hitched would've stopped all that. I mean, there are married guys out there who still get up to no good, right? It's not about being married or not.  It's about the person.\n\nPlus, becoming a priest is a choice, right? There are churches where fellas can get hitched and still preach, like on that show \"Seventh Heaven\".  If someone really wants both, maybe they should check out a different faith.\n\nAs for the whole pedophilia thing, I think it's kinda in their genes, ya know? It's not like they learn it, it's just who they are. Like, look at it this way: you can't just change someone's genes by letting them get married. It might come out anyway.  \n\nIf the church knew about it and covered it up, well, that's messed up. Shame on them. But I don't think they always knew either.",
            "(laughs) \nMan, where do I even begin? I mean, at first, I was kinda okay with the whole Iraq thing, but everyone was still reeling from 9/11, you know? It felt like we jumped into it all too quick. There were these justifications thrown around, connecting Iraq to Bin Laden and 9/11, saying Saddam had WMDs.  Turns out, all that was a load of crap. It really grinds my gears, this whole Iraq war just boils my blood.\n\nThe Bush administration flat out lied to the American people, and they still haven't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, remember that big UN speech he gave? He's now saying he wasn't even convinced by the evidence at the time! That's messed up, man. That's straight-up abuse of power.  They've got zero respect for the Constitution, they've been trying to sideline it ever since 9/11, at least. I think they came in wanting to go to war from day one. \n\nThere was this Treasury Secretary –  I can’t remember his name, but he wrote a book after being pushed out, basically saying the younger Bush wanted revenge against Saddam for his dad's time in office. Plus, I'm sure they had their eyes on Iraq's energy resources too.  Sneaky, right?\n\nIt's gone on way too long. Pulling out now would be a disaster, though. The country could collapse into civil war, and more people would die. The UN and the US are trying to get a coalition of neighboring countries – Syria, Saudi Arabia, that sort of thing – to come in and try to stabilize things. But that doesn't feel right either. It messes with Iraq's sovereignty, and the interim government is already falling apart.\n\nThe news reports make it clear that the Parliament isn't doing much, and the Prime Minister seems to have no real control.  Even that guy we were fighting, al-Sadr, his party now has 20 seats in Parliament! We're stuck with all these radical factions fighting for power, and it's a recipe for disaster.\n\n(laughs)\nThe real mess?  I can't even start explaining that. It's too much.",
            "I dunno, man.  This whole Iraq thing is a real head-scratcher. It feels kinda pointless, y'know? Like, it wasn't even a real war, officially.  Just this \"get back at 'em\" thing after 9/11, like they were the only ones who could've done it.  I'm not really into all the war talk, haven't been keeping up with the details. \n\nBut from what I gather, we're stuck there trying to build democracy, just so it can be another U.S. thing, plus, you know, the oil. But it's pissing everyone off, and it just feels wrong.\n\nIt's a catch-22, too. If we leave, they'll be pissed because we messed everything up and they're back to square one. And if we stay, it'll take forever to build this democracy thing, which is a whole other mess.\n\nHonestly, I'm lost. This is one topic I know nothing about.  War in Iraq?  My brain hurts just thinking about it.  \n\nMaybe it's better to just keep it going, right? Like, show them we're tough,  we're American, we got guns.  But it's messed up, it shouldn't even be called a war. Congress never even declared it, so what's the point?\n\nI feel bad for Bush, though. It's turning him into another  Nixon, another president who started a pointless war.  Like Vietnam, remember?  Ending up labeled as the \"meaningless war\" president.\n\nI don't know what to say. It's a tough one.  So many families have loved ones over there, you want them to come back safe, right? But then you think about the Iraqi people, their lives are screwed up, schools are gone, different groups fighting each other.\n\nWe're trying to force our way of life on them, like turning them into another USA.  But will that even work? It just seems like it'll make things worse, make them even angrier at us.\n\nMaybe this is just a war that'll drag on forever, a never-ending mess.",
            "My gut says it ain't right for the government to make this stuff legal.  It's right there in the Constitution, separation of church and state.  It's clear as day.  Trying to boss around what folks believe, that's against what's already written in stone.\n\nIt feels like picking sides, you know? Saying one church's beliefs are the right ones. Most Catholics and Christians I know are against this, except for maybe some folks in Boston. But who are we to tell churches what they can and can't say?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's how we keep things fair in this country. It's about letting everyone practice their faith without the government stepping in.\n\nTrying to change that with an amendment? That's crazy talk. It'd be like contradicting the whole Constitution. Plus, it'd be the only amendment that's used to control people instead of the government.  \n\nThe government shouldn't be involved.  This is a personal belief thing, like him pushing this amendment just 'cause he's Catholic. It feels like he's favoring one religion over all the others.\n\nLet the churches decide what's right for them.  That's what the Constitution is all about. There's no good reason to change that.",
            "Okay, so let's talk about the war in Iraq. From the get-go, I don't think the government was straight with the American people about why we went to war. They tried to link it to the September 11th attacks, making it seem like they were directly connected, when really, they weren't that closely tied. They used the emotions of the people who were hurting and angry after 9/11 to push the invasion, which started in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I'm against war in almost any situation, especially preemptive strikes. This whole thing feels like a repeat of the Vietnam War, where the government made the same mistakes. It's heartbreaking to see so many American soldiers die, and the whole situation is a mess. They went in, removed the Iraqi government, and weren't ready for what came after. They didn't anticipate the power vacuum, the chaos, and the instability. \n\nIt's like what they did in Vietnam, trying to push out communism and install democracy. They thought it would be a quick, clean victory, but it was a long, hard struggle. And just like in Vietnam, no matter how many people support you, there are always going to be insurgents who want to fight. It's hard to fight a war against a whole population when you're not fighting a traditional army.\n\nSo, I think the government messed up big time. First of all, they shouldn't have gone to war in the first place. But if they had to, they should have been prepared for everything that could go wrong. They weren't ready for the aftermath, and now we're still there in 2006, with American troops dying and trying to train Iraqi forces to take over. \n\nIt's a long process, and the US government made it seem like it would be easy. They made it seem like a quick, successful mission, but it's not that simple. Building a new government and a functioning democracy takes time, and it's not easy. Just look at our own history – it took a lot of struggle and bloodshed to get to where we are today.\n\nThe whole situation is complicated, and it's hard to know what the right decision is. On one hand, we can't just abandon Iraq after all we've done there.  On the other hand, how many more American lives are we willing to risk? How much is too much? And what about the oil? Isn't that a big factor in this whole mess?\n\nIt feels like we're just going through the motions, and there's no real end in sight. I just hope it all ends soon and that there can be some peace in Iraq. But I'm not holding my breath.",
            "Alright, so let me tell ya, I'm all for gay marriage, always have been. It's a personal thing, ya know? And science is showing more and more that it might even be biological, not just some social thing.  It's kinda messed up to take away someone's rights just 'cause of something they can't control. It's like, inhumane, ya know?  I've always been on the side of equality for everyone.\n\nI mean, politics and the government shouldn't have a say in this. It's not their business. It's between two people, their families, their lives. Hell, there are a couple of gay couples right here in my neighborhood. They're just like any other family, walking their dogs, going about their day. They're not hurting anyone. So why can't they get married?\n\nThis whole \"Bush playing God\" thing and trying to twist the definition of marriage? It's ridiculous.\n\nAnd listen, I've read all sorts of stuff, reports, articles, whatever - they're saying it's actually a chemical thing in your brain, like you're born that way. It's not about growing up with a bunch of sisters or not having a dad, it's different.\n\nIt's just unfair.  If a straight couple wants to get married, they can go do it in Vegas without anyone knowing. But for two gay people, it's like a national news story. It's like it should be a private thing, not something the whole world needs to know about.",
            "Okay, so, listen up.  When you drop something on the internet, it's like shouting it from the rooftops. It's public, plain and simple. You can't just erase it or pretend it never happened. As an assistant, I've seen firsthand how stuff online can really mess things up.\n\nImagine posting about wanting to blow stuff up or talking about shootings. People are gonna freak out, man. Someone's bound to tell the school, and they can't just ignore it. If something bad happens, they'll be asking, \"Why didn't we do something?\"\n\nIt's a tough situation because sometimes people just mess around, right? Maybe it was a bad joke, or a sociology experiment gone wrong. But sometimes, it can be really serious. \n\nA while back, we had something similar happen at my school. Someone overheard a student talking about something scary, and they reported it. The school looked into it and found some concerning stuff on the student's Facebook. \n\nSee, when you put stuff online, you're basically waving a flag that says, \"Hey, look at me!\" You can't control how people react to it. They might take it seriously, or they might laugh it off. But the bottom line is, once it's out there, it's out there.\n\nSo, think before you post. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. And if you're talking about something serious, maybe just keep it to yourself. It's not worth the risk.",
            "This whole war thing stretches on forever, ya know? Once upon a time, I thought it had a decent purpose – bringing democracy to a place that needed it. But somewhere along the line, it feels like we lost sight of that. Now it's just about flexing our muscles, proving we're the big dogs.  \n\nAnd honestly, the whole thing started kinda shady. Remember Bush sr. and his beef with Saddam?  Maybe that's where the whole thing got twisted. If we were really trying to help, to bring freedom to a country under a cruel leader, that'd be a noble cause. But if there was personal baggage in there, that's just wrong.\n\nLook, I think we made our point those first few months, sending a message that we weren't messing around. But it's been years. Way too long. We keep plugging away at it, like we have to win this thing, but I don't even know what we're winning anymore.  \n\nIt's like we're stuck in this endless cycle of war just for the sake of war. We've got our own problems here at home – poverty, schools, healthcare – things that need our attention. Billions and billions are getting poured into this fight, when that money could be helping people right here. \n\nIt's got to end. At some point, these folks gotta figure out their own destiny. We can't be their babysitters forever. It's draining our own resources, our own soul. We need to stop throwing good money after bad and start focusing on what really matters.",
            "So, like, there's this question about privacy, right?  Someone found info online and, uh, it stopped something bad from happening.  Is that, like, an invasion of privacy?  \n\nI mean, on Myspace, if you put stuff out there, it's kinda open to everyone, y'know?  You gotta be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends, they're seeing it.  You're giving them permission.  When you put stuff online, you gotta know a lot of people will see it.  So, if someone saw something and stopped something bad, maybe that's a good thing?\n\nIt's tough, though.  You can't have someone watching everyone's profile all the time.  That'd be like picking on \"bad kids\" or something.  It wouldn't be fair.  But maybe if they had a reason to look at a specific profile, like if they had a lead on something?  I dunno.\n\nHmm, I don't have Myspace myself, but I use Facebook.  It creeps me out knowing there are weirdos out there who can see stuff about me.  I saw this thing on TV about a guy who showed how easy it was to get info from profiles.  He found a girl's screen name and was IMing her within a minute, got her to meet up!  I wouldn't do that, obviously.  But people in my classes message me on IM, even though I don't recognize their names.  It's scary because they know stuff about me - my interests, what I look like, where I am.  Photos, everything.  I try to limit what I put online, but it's hard.  I use it to talk to friends, but it's a risk, you know?  You never know who's looking.\n\nMy roommate said her high school banned Myspace.  That seemed kinda weird to me.  How can they control what we do outside of school?",
            "Ugh, talking about this war just feels messed up. I hate jumping on the bandwagon, you know?  \"Oh, I was against it from the start!\"  It's not really about that anymore.  I mean, everyone basically agrees it was a bad idea except for the people in power. They can't admit they were wrong, right?  \n\nLook at the polls! American polls, Iraqi polls, global polls – everyone thinks it was a disaster. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops over there think we should get out. It was a mess before we even went in, and pulling out is going to be another mess.  It's just… everything in the Middle East is a minefield these days.\n\nIt all boils down to cultural clashes, I guess. The US and the Middle East are just too different. Our government thinks they can force democracy on them, but it's not their way. Saddam was a bad guy, sure, but invading a country blindly is never the answer.  It's like quicksand.\n\nI don't know what to say anymore.  There's no easy solution. It all feels hopeless.  \n\nThe administration might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard a good one yet. Leaving gradually over a year or so, maybe that's okay. But just staying...   \n\nEighty percent of the Iraqi people want us gone within a year. At least a quarter of them want us out right now.  It's their country, shouldn't their voices matter?  \n\nMaybe we ask them, you know?  \"Should we leave?\" If they say yes, then it's on them, not us, if things go south. \n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least it'd be a step in the right direction.",
            "Okay, so yeah, I totally think gender discrimination is still a thing in the U.S., and it's not just about women, you know?  It kind of depends on what field you're in. \n\nLike, overall, I feel women still have a tougher time because of this \"glass ceiling.\"  Even though equality is supposed to be a thing,  a lot of guys struggle with the idea of having a woman boss them around. It's because of how society's been for so long, you know? So, sometimes women will see a job they're totally qualified for, but the board won't promote them just because, historically, women haven't been in those top positions. \n\nIt's the same for guys, though, in other fields.  Take stay-at-home dads, for example. It's really uncommon for a guy to be the one staying home, and people often judge them for it.  Society thinks, \"Oh, you're the man, you should be the breadwinner!\"  But what if the wife has the better job, and he really wants to raise the kids? It can be tough because society doesn't really get it.\n\nThen there's the fashion industry. Guys who are straight and into fashion sometimes don't get taken seriously.  Maybe it's because guys in fashion are often seen as having a different lifestyle, and people assume they just don't \"get\" women's fashion. They question their knowledge and style.\n\nSo, yeah, I think gender discrimination is definitely still around in the U.S., and it depends on the field you're in.\n\nChanging it is hard, though. Society has a set way of thinking, and even though we've come a long way since the 1800s, change is slow. But things are getting better. More women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in the business world, and stay-at-home dads are becoming more common.\n\nIt's all about slowly changing people's minds. You can't force it, or they'll resist. We're finding a good balance, though, where people are slowly starting to accept things more.",
            "Okay, so, they didn't exactly legalize it, you know? They decriminalized it. Like, it's not a crime anymore, it's more like a traffic ticket. You get cited, not arrested. And that's a big deal, because those drug charges can mess you up big time, especially for job interviews and stuff.  Even with decriminalization, those worries about the future consequences, they don't just disappear.\n\nBut think about it, arresting people, booking them, holding them, the court appearances, the lawyers... it all costs a ton of money! And a lot of places, especially those struggling financially, just can't afford it. Even if it means letting go of a lot of that old, \"marijuana is evil\" thinking. \n\nDenver, though, they're a different story. More open-minded, you know?  They're probably using all that saved money now on good stuff, like schools, helping the elderly, feeding the homeless.  It's all about priorities, right?\n\nNow, I'm not saying marijuana should be everywhere, like cigarettes in gas stations. That would be weird! Plus,  it's still kinda frowned upon in a lot of places. Imagine everyone just smoking openly, it would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol, though, that's a whole other story. It messes with your motor skills worse than weed, but marijuana can really mess with your life, your choices, your whole vibe. \n\nEveryone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle anything, others, not so much. It's a tricky thing to talk about because there's no one-size-fits-all answer.",
            "I'd say \"yeah\" to Catholicism, kinda. I mean, there are some solid things about it - like they've stuck to their traditions for ages, which can be good.  But, you gotta be able to bend a little, right? \n\nA lot of Catholics seem stuck on going to church every week and doing things *exactly* the way they always have. It feels kinda judgmental, like they look down on anyone who doesn't follow the rules perfectly or who's not a die-hard Catholic. They don't really seem to welcome people from other religions either.\n\nLike, my dad was Episcopalian, and my mom was Catholic, but the church wouldn't marry them.  It felt pretty hypocritical to me,  cause Catholics are always saying love everyone, but then they turn around and don't accept people who are different.\n\nIt's like they preach one thing, but then live another way. A lot of their rules feel totally outdated, but they cling to them anyway.\n\nI think letting priests get married could be a good thing, but I don't think it would stop the bad stuff from happening.  It's a different kind of issue.\n\nHonestly, people who hurt kids are probably gonna do it no matter what, married or not. It's not about the marriage, it's about the sick person.",
            "Okay, so, this whole marriage thing is a real head-scratcher for me. I haven't totally figured out where I stand yet. It's like walking a tightrope between separating church and state, and figuring out what marriage *really* is. It's tough to talk about without stepping on someone's toes, ya know? \n\nI'm not sure if marriage should be something the government defines, especially since it's considered a sacrament by some.  Think about it, if you were baptized, the government wouldn't care, right?  They wouldn't offer tax breaks or treat you differently.  So, maybe marriage should just be seen as a civil union – two people coming together.  The government shouldn't get involved in the \"type\" of marriage, just the fact that two people are united.  \n\nAs for gay marriage, well, if all the states can agree on a fair solution, maybe it should become federal law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it?  That seems crazy.  I mean, the constitution shouldn't be changed just because some people feel strongly about something.  It's a big deal for some, sure, but not big enough to rewrite the fundamental laws of the land.  It just feels wrong to me.",
            "My upbringing was in a Christian household, so the whole homosexuality thing is kinda a mixed bag for me.  I've got a bunch of gay friends, and I respect them, you know? I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I totally think they should be able to do their thing. It shouldn't be a big national deal.  \n\nI think it should be left up to each state to decide, not the president. Like, wouldn't it be better if each state could choose what works best for them?  You've got your red states and your blue states, right? Blue states are more likely to be all for gay marriage, and if you live in a blue state, well, that's just how things are there. Kinda like, you chose to live there, so you gotta roll with it. \n\nI believe everyone, gay or straight, should have the same opportunities. So yeah, I think gay marriage should be legal, but let each state decide. \n\nHonestly, it feels wrong for someone like Bush to tell the whole country what to think about gay marriage. It's not his call! Each state should be free to make its own rules. He doesn't live in every state, so why should he get to decide for them? \n\nAnd think about it, he's leaving office soon anyway. If a Democratic president comes in and wants to overturn the ban, what's it gonna be, back and forth forever? Just let the states figure it out themselves. They're the ones who have to live with the consequences.",
            "Um, no, I don't at all. Let me see... The way I see it, Myspace is like a public bulletin board. If you post something there, you're putting it out for everyone to see, whether it's school officials or not.\n\nSo, when those officials saw it, they had every right to.  Even if they weren't using the school's name, they could still access it from home.  But think about it, if it helps prevent a school shooting, you know, if it saves students' lives, that's the school's responsibility.  I think that's totally okay.\n\nNow, I get it, if they're just snooping around on Myspace looking for students to get in trouble for drinking or smoking, that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're trying to make the school safer, I don't think it's an invasion at all.\n\nIt's easier to express yourself when you're writing things down.  \n\nAnyway, Myspace is public. Students posting stuff expecting not to get in trouble?  That's ridiculous!  I even worry about posting stuff on email. If I have something negative to say about someone, I never do it. I'm afraid someone will see it somehow.\n\nEverything comes back around these days, you know?  Like, if you do something bad in college, some big shot might find an old email and it bites you in the butt. Once it's on the internet, it's always there.  \n\nI don't think it was an invasion of privacy because, like I said, it's public. I don't think they should be constantly searching for trouble, but if they have a reason to look, to make the school safer, like preventing something horrible like Columbine, then I'm okay with it. Parents trust the school to keep their kids safe, and that's what they were trying to do.",
            "Alright, so, this whole war thing... at first, I was all for it, you know? Nine Eleven hit close to home, and I felt like we had to go over there and, like, dish out some payback. I get it, it was an emotional thing, but looking back, I think we rushed into it without thinking things through. We kinda went in blind, unprepared, without a real plan. And, honestly, it backfired big time. I mean, I was all for it at the start, but now? Totally against it. I just don't think it accomplished anything.\n\nIt's like, those people over there, as long as they're fighting amongst themselves, they're not gonna be fighting us. Us being there just doesn't make a difference if they can't even get along with each other, you know? It's like pouring water on a fire that's already burning itself out.  \n\nAnd to be honest, because of Nine Eleven, I just... I don't care about what happens over there anymore. Those people, I just don't care. They fight amongst themselves, they can't even solve their own problems, it's just sad. \n\nWe went in there totally unprepared, didn't know what we were facing, and honestly, war is different for them than it is for us. They're just... savage. I don't think they're trying to improve their country, they just want us out of there. And maybe that's okay, maybe we should just leave.\n\nI think we were just hyped up, fueled by anger and revenge. We weren't thinking rationally about the consequences, about how they would react to us trying to change their whole way of life. Bush declaring war on Iraq, well, I see where he was coming from. We couldn't just let them get away with it, right? But maybe we could've planned better, had a clearer idea of what we wanted to achieve.\n\nThere was no unity, no clear direction. We just went in there with anger and aggression, and that's what we created there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be like that, and we're just hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but not enough to justify staying. It's like a bandage on a gaping wound.  We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, it's just gonna collapse again. It's time to cut our losses and move on."
