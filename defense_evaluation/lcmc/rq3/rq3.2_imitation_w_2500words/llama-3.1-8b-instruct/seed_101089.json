            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church does need to adapt to some changes. They're losing followers, and I believe it's partly because they're not very open-minded about certain things. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which I think might be the problem. If they were to modernize their views a bit, I think they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard that people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of its stance on these issues. Some individuals are beginning to disagree with the Church's views, which is making them feel like the Church has the wrong perspective. The Church's stance on abortion, for example, might make it difficult for those who support it to feel comfortable following the Church's teachings.\n\nIt's also hard to understand why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think this would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing, but it's hard to say for sure. Perhaps if priests were allowed to be married, they might have made different choices, but it's hard to know for certain.\n\nOne thing that does make sense to me is that priests shouldn't be prevented from having a family life. Everyone else has a job and other loved ones, so why can't priests have both a career and a personal life? After all, the Church says priests are married to God, but that doesn't mean they can't have a personal life or devoted relationships with others.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it's wrong to hold them accountable for something they can't control.\n\nTo me, it doesn't seem like a choice, like someone could just decide to be straight or gay. People are either born straight or gay, and they shouldn't be judged for it. I mean, I was born straight, and I'm assuming other people are born the way they are too.\n\nI think it's unfair to make people feel like they've made a wrong choice just because of who they are. I don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue because it's not a matter of security or morality, it's just about people's personal lives. They shouldn't be telling people who they can or can't love.\n\nIt's not the government's place to interfere with people's relationships, especially when it comes to something as personal as their sexual orientation. I think it's just a matter of accepting people for who they are and not judging them.\n\nI'm not sure how to put it, but I think the government should stay out of it. It's not a security issue, it's not a moral issue, it's just about people living their lives. And I don't think they should be punished for being who they are.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but this is a misconception. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin - they're not the same, and it's unfair to treat them as such.\n\nOne of the main issues is that gay couples often don't have the same rights as straight couples. For example, if you're in a gay relationship and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you because they're not technically considered family. This seems pretty silly, especially if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nStudies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples, and they face the same challenges in their relationships. The main difference is that they're in love with someone of the same sex, but that doesn't make their relationship any less valid.\n\nThe thing is, gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church - they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. It's not about the church and state issue, it's about equal rights. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but equal is not the same thing. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships.\n\nPeople often worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are valid concerns. However, it's hard to say for sure how children of gay couples will adjust to society, especially in terms of their parents' sexual orientation. But this is a new area of study, and it's hard to make blanket statements.\n\nThe main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools. It's not about the parents' abilities, but about societal attitudes.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what's currently proposed. President Bush's views on gay marriage are likely influenced by his religious beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the country.\n\nLastly, it's ironic that some people are opposed to the idea of gay marriage while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of the country. It's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on the entire country, especially when it's not universally accepted. \n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and if people listened to research and studies instead of popular opinion, things might be different.",
            "Honestly, my job at the hospital pharmacy during the summer really opened my eyes to the benefits of certain substances. Just because something is considered taboo doesn't mean it's not helpful. I'm saying that if we're talking about making it available to the public, I'm definitely not in favor of that. But for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. The fact that a substance is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's not beneficial – it's all about perspective. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that we use all the time in pharmacies, like oxycontin and vicodin. They're controlled, but we still use them because they're helpful. So, why can't we do the same with marijuana, just because there's a stigma around it? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than dwelling on the negative. \n\nOne thing that bothers me is that people compare marijuana to alcohol, but it's not exactly the same. While abusing marijuana can have its downsides, so can abusing alcohol. It's a complex issue, and I don't think we should just outright ban it. Instead, I think we should take a step back and try to educate people about its benefits, and maybe even gradually introduce it in a controlled environment. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana, I think people will be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.\n\nIt's crazy how people's perception of marijuana is skewed because of its illegal status. They view it as this terrible substance, but it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's minds about marijuana, I think we'd see a more responsible approach to using it. And who knows, it could even be a game-changer for people in need of medical treatment.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, especially when it comes to its traditions and expectations. As someone who grew up attending church every Sunday, I can attest to this shift. I remember dressing up in cute outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse, every Sunday. It was a big part of my routine, especially since I attended a private school where I'd see my friends on weekends. The church even introduced a \"teenager mass\" that was significantly shorter, lasting only 30 minutes, and people started dressing more casually, even during summer when they'd come in straight from the beach. It's become a much more casual atmosphere, even during morning masses where I used to dress up. People now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from the more formal attire of my youth. This is probably the biggest thing I've noticed about the church.\n\nI don't think the church's stance on female priests or priests being allowed to marry would have prevented the allegations of pedophilia. There are still men who become pedophiles, even if they're married or part of other faiths that allow them to marry. It's not about the rules or restrictions, but about the individual's choices and desires. Plus, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and there are other religions that allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue to the Catholic Church. If someone wants to be a priest and be married, they might consider a different faith.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is more related to genetics than environmental factors. I don't think people just become pedophiles; they're born with these tendencies. While upbringing might play a small role, it's not the primary cause. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or other means. If the church knew about the allegations and tried to cover them up, that's a separate issue, but I don't think their stance on priests' marriages would have made a difference in preventing these cases.\n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any other thoughts to share on the matter.",
            "I was initially on board with the premise, but I think the world was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of events that led to the invasion, rather than a solid reason. The Bush administration linked the war in Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration just lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just a serious abuse of power in my opinion, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution since 9/11, and it seems like they always had plans to go to war.\n\nTo be honest, I think the younger Bush came into office with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and he was hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI do think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to problems since there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more deaths. The alternative of having the UN and the US work with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order doesn't seem like a good idea either. In the long run, it could create more problems because Iraq's sovereignty would be at issue, and it's clear that the interim government is faltering.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament isn't very effective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the government. Even the radical elements we were fighting last year, like Mugtada al-Sadr, now have a significant presence in the Parliament, causing more friction in the government.",
            "I'm not really sure about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's a pretty complex issue for me. I think a lot of people would agree that it's not really a declared war, but more of a retaliation against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and gain access to their oil resources. However, I'm not convinced this is a good reason to stay in Iraq, especially considering how it's causing so much tension and conflict. If we leave, Iraq will likely have to start from scratch, but if we stay, we'll be trying to impose our own democracy, which could take years and potentially make things worse. \n\nI'm not really sure what to think about this. I think it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families affected by it, but at the same time, I worry that our involvement is making things worse. It's a delicate balance between supporting the people of Iraq and respecting their culture, but also not trying to impose our own values on them. I fear that our interference could lead to more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida. I think this conflict will be ongoing for a long time, and it's hard to see a clear resolution.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as lawful. I believe it's up to the churches to decide this issue, given that the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This separation is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Making an amendment to restrict this would be contradictory to what's already been stated and written in the constitution.\n\nIn my opinion, even considering an amendment would be wrong, as it would be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't see why the government should be involved in this issue, except maybe because of the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. However, this is a clear example of the president showing preference for a particular religion over others.\n\nI think the churches should decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no real reason to support this amendment, other than personal views, and I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society. In any case, I've expressed my thoughts on this matter.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I think the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading Iraq, they linked the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government manipulated public emotions to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq war is a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways – the US government should've learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible. They removed the Iraqi government, but I don't think the US was prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The US was trying to establish a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they should've known it wouldn't be a smooth process.\n\nThe government should've planned for all possible outcomes, but it seems they weren't prepared for the long and difficult ordeal that ensued. Many American troops are still dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, which is a long and complex process. I think the US government made the American people believe it would be a short and successful engagement, but it's not that easy to establish a new form of government.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government made the decision to go to war in a way that was unrealistic and naive, considering the struggles we've faced in our own country to develop a democratic government. It's not something that can be done overnight, and it's not as easy as it seems. I think the government should've been more honest about the challenges they faced in Iraq.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you've been there for so long. We're the ones who removed their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them? But on the other hand, we can't keep risking American lives for an undetermined amount of time. The reason for invading Iraq was to establish a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? I think it's all about the oil issue and controlling resources. The fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, but we're not taking action against countries like North Korea, shows that the US government isn't being thorough or truthful in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, I don't think that's likely.",

I've always been, and I think it's essential that people are allowed to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives. With the growing amount of research showing that being gay could be determined by biology rather than social influences, it's hard to justify taking away people's rights based on something they can't control. \n\nTo me, it's inhumane to deny people the same rights as everyone else just because of their sexual orientation. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it's a personal matter that should be left out of politics. It's not about the state or the government; it's about individual freedom and the right to love who you want. \n\nTake my neighborhood back home for example - there are a few openly gay couples living there, but they're not married because they're not allowed to be. Despite that, they lead normal lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks and live their lives as they see fit. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush are trying to impose their own interpretation of marriage on everyone else. \n\nResearch has shown that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which can't be changed by upbringing or environment. It's not about how you're raised or your family dynamics; it's about who you are. \n\nOne of the main issues with gay marriage is that it's treated as a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it's front-page news. It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public debate and scrutiny. It's time for us to stop treating it like a national issue and let people make their own choices in peace.",
            "I don't know what to say, but when you put something online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've dealt with this issue before, and it's a big deal. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and if you're posting about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, people are going to take notice. Someone will inevitably say something or share it with someone who will act on it, and the school can't just ignore it because they might be able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough to know what to take seriously, though, because some people just joke around online. I've seen situations like the one at our school, where someone posted something that seemed like a joke but ended up being a serious issue. In this case, someone overheard someone making a comment at school, and it was reported. When we found out who the person was, their friends looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that could be misinterpreted. When you post things online, there's no private space; if you don't want people to see it, don't post it.\n\nYou can't control what people think, and you can't tell them what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media, but if something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's brought to their attention by someone you've given access to, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, I do think it's a bad idea for teachers to create fake social media accounts to monitor their students – that's not their place.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, so I wouldn't friend them on social media. If they post something online that I shouldn't see, I don't want to have to deal with it. That's not my responsibility, and it's not a connection I want to make.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, I believed that the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now just continuing the war for the sake of it, to prove our military strength. I'm not sure if the original motivations were even pure, considering George Bush's family history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn my opinion, if the goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason. But I think things have gotten off track. I believe we made our point in the first few months of the war, and starting it was a powerful statement in itself. However, continuing it for over a year or more just seems like a drawn-out ordeal.\n\nIf our purpose was to free a country from a tyrant's rule, I think that's a valid reason for war. But over time, it seems like our reasons have become distorted and misconceived. It's as if we're still fighting just to fight, and we want to avoid a decisive end or a victory. I genuinely think it's time to stop.\n\nWe've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be used to tackle our own issues like poverty and internal problems. Our economy is being drained for a cause that's no longer clear. War should not be a long-term part of our budget. We have pressing issues like public roads, schools, healthcare, and more that deserve funding.\n\nRight now, money is being spent on a war that's lost its purpose, and some of our citizens are sacrificing their lives. I think that's a tragic waste of resources.",
            "To clarify, I have a question. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, but I wanted to bring it up. Someone recently found out about a situation because they looked at someone's online profile on a site like Myspace. I think it's kind of a gray area, to be honest. If you post information online, it's pretty much available for anyone to see. On Myspace, for example, you have to add someone as a friend in order to see their profile, but by doing so, you're giving them permission to see your information. So, if someone looks at your profile, it's not really an invasion of privacy, per se.\n\nI mean, I think it's actually a good thing that they were able to see that information and potentially prevent a bad situation from happening. However, it raises some questions about whether it's right for someone to be constantly monitoring people's profiles to prevent something like that from happening. It's not feasible for one person to be watching everyone's profiles all the time, and it could lead to discrimination if they're only focusing on certain individuals.\n\nIt's a complicated issue, and I'm not really sure what the right answer is. I have a Facebook account, and it's a bit unsettling to know that there are people out there who can see information about me. I've heard stories about people getting information about others online and using it to contact them, which can be really creepy. It's hard to know who can see what, and it's a bit of a trade-off between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially after hearing about a guy on TV who was able to get a girl's screen name and contact information online and meet up with her in a short amount of time. It's a bit disturbing to think about how easy it is for people to get that kind of information. I've had people I don't know contact me on my Facebook and IM me, which can be a bit unnerving.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to stay in touch with my friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. My roommate was telling me about a situation at her high school where students were banned from having Myspace accounts, which I found a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or not, but it seems like the school shouldn't have had the authority to tell students what they can and can't do online.\n\nI'm not really sure what the solution is, but it's definitely something to think about.",
            "I'm a bit uncertain about what to say about the Iraq War, to be honest. I feel like I'm joining the bandwagon by criticizing it, and I don't want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start just to be vindicated later. However, it's not really a matter of being right or wrong anymore, but rather a general consensus that the war was a bad idea, apart from within the administration, which refuses to admit its mistakes. \n\nIf we look at polls conducted in the US, Iraq, and globally, we see that around 75-80% of the world's population believes the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view, and so do 70% of the US troops stationed there. It's clear that the war was a disaster from the start, and pulling out now won't be easy either. The situation is complex, and the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern states are too vast for administrations to understand.\n\nIt's ironic that the US thinks it can impose democracy on a region where it's not naturally accepted. The previous administration, and to some extent the current one, seems to think they can bring about change in a place that's not ready for it. I don't think anyone disputes Saddam's bad record, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. \n\nHonestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer. The administration might be coming up with hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons yet. If they want to withdraw gradually over several years, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't just leave now. According to statistics, 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do, and if we ask them, they'll make the decision for us. If things go wrong, we can say we were following their wishes.\n\nIn any case, if we decide to help after leaving, at least we'll be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the aggressors we are today.",
            "You know, I genuinely believe gender discrimination is still a widespread issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, but I think it's especially prevalent in certain professions. For instance, even though we're supposed to have equal opportunities, people often struggle to find a woman in a leadership position. This is largely due to the societal norms we've developed over time, where men are often expected to be in charge. As a result, women might have the qualifications for a particular job, but they may be overlooked for promotions simply because it's not customary for women to hold upper management positions. \n\nThe same issue applies to men in certain industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. It's still uncommon for men to stay at home and care for the kids, and society tends to view this as abnormal. People often assume that men should be the breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home may face criticism. It's hard for them because they might have always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives, and their partners might be the ones with better job prospects. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's also a problem with taking men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's because men who are into fashion often have different styles and preferences, and people might question their credibility in the field. They might think, \"If you're a man, how do I know you truly understand what women want in fashion?\" This can be a major obstacle for men in the industry.\n\nIt's tough to change these attitudes because societal norms are deeply ingrained, and we've made progress at a relatively slow pace. However, we're moving in the right direction. More women are taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs, which is helping to break down barriers. Similarly, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted as men realize that their partners might have better job prospects or a stronger work ethic.\n\nTo promote positive change, it's essential to showcase the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be too pushy or forceful, as this can lead to resistance. Instead, we should highlight their strengths and qualities, which can help shift people's perceptions. It's a delicate balance, but I think we're making progress, and change takes time.\n\nInterestingly, people from different backgrounds and with varying education levels can also face discrimination. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education might be overlooked for a CEO position because their grammar isn't perfect, even if they're extremely intelligent. Other men might look down on them, thinking, \"How can I trust you if you can't even put together a coherent sentence?\"\n\nSo, it's not just about gender; it's also about where you come from and how you communicate. It's a complex issue, and there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality.",
            "So, to clarify the current laws, they've decriminalized marijuana, which essentially downgrades the offense from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket. This means that you can get cited for it, but it won't lead to the same severe consequences as a full-blown drug charge. However, people still worry about the potential long-term effects on their future, as these won't necessarily disappear just because it's decriminalized.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that the costs associated with arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession can be quite high. It involves a lot of resources, including police time, court proceedings, and public defenders. In municipalities facing financial difficulties, some are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community needs.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal and open-minded place, seems to have found a balance that works for them. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've been able to allocate more resources towards public education, social programs, and other essential services. This approach seems to be a step in the right direction, as it acknowledges the financial and social aspects of the issue.\n\nOf course, there are valid concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use. If it were fully legalized, it could lead to increased usage, which might become a problem. However, it's also worth considering that marijuana's impact on people varies greatly, just like how individuals react to other substances. Some people can handle it responsibly, while others might struggle with its effects on their lifestyle.\n\nIn my opinion, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, but it's difficult to generalize how people will react. Ultimately, it's essential to acknowledge that individuals respond differently to substances, and we should focus on promoting responsible use and moderation.",
            "To be honest, I agree with the traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, as they have been doing things in the same way for a long time. On one hand, it's great to have roots in tradition, but on the other hand, it's essential to be open to change. I think a lot of Catholics believe they must attend church every week, and they're quite strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church judges those who don't strictly follow the doctrine and doesn't accept people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics.\n\nFor example, my parents, both of whom were Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their religions. This doesn't seem very tolerant, given the Catholic teaching of loving others. It's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. In my opinion, the Catholic Church's teachings tell people to do certain things, but their practices contradict these teachings because they're outdated. They stick with these outdated practices despite this contradiction.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily be a good idea, but I don't think it would prevent them from engaging in pedophilic behavior either. Pedophiles would likely still act on their impulses regardless of their marital status. It's a different situation altogether – they would likely still act on their desires, whether or not they're married.\n\nIn my view, those who abuse children will do so regardless of their marital status. It's not about being married or not; it's about the nature of the relationship. I don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these situations from happening. They would likely continue to occur despite any changes to the marriage policy.",
            "Honestly, I'm still on the fence about this topic... I haven't made up my mind yet, and I'm not sure if either side has a strong argument. What I do know is that this issue is super tricky - we're talking about the separation of church and state, and defining marriage in a way that won't offend anyone. That's tough to do. I think that all civil unions should be recognized, but I'm not convinced that marriage should be defined by the government, especially when it's a sacrament for some people. If it's just a matter of two people getting together, then it should be treated as a civil union, without the government getting involved in the specifics. And as for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people, a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push for it to become federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That just seems ridiculous. It's not a big enough issue to warrant amending the constitution. It's pretty simple, really - we shouldn't amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage. No way.",
            "Honestly, growing up in a Christian household made me look at homosexuality as a bit of a gray area. On one hand, I have many gay friends, which has given me a deeper understanding of the issue. However, I still don't entirely agree with the lifestyle. That being said, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter that the federal government should decide on its own. Instead, it should be up to individual states to make their own decisions.\n\nI think this is where democracy comes into play, as many states have different political leanings. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, so if you live in one, you're already aware of the local stance. I don't think it's right to disagree with the decision if a state chooses to legalize gay marriage, given that you chose to live there. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so I believe it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered that point. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I don't think President Bush should have the authority to dictate how the entire country feels about gay marriage. I believe it's the individual states that should decide whether to legalize it or not. I don't agree with his decision to ban it nationwide.\n\nIt just seems to me that Bush doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each state should run itself. In a couple of years, he'll be out of office, and if a Democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to leave it up to each individual state, as they'll be the ones living with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't agree.",
            "To be honest, I don't really get it, but let me break it down for you. Myspace is a public platform, right? It's like a bulletin board where you share your thoughts and experiences with others. If you post something on Myspace, you have to consider that others, including school officials, might see it. They might not even be looking for it under the school's name, but they could easily access it from their homes.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent school shootings or other potential threats, I think that's okay. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking online, I'm all for it. I mean, if they're just looking for students who are breaking the rules, like drinking or smoking, that's a different story. I think that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it to prevent harm, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nI know it's easy to express yourself more freely when you're writing, but when you're speaking, it's a different story. People often post things on Myspace without thinking about the consequences, and it can come back to haunt them. If you say something bad about someone in an email or post it online, it can be hard to take it back. It's like everything you do online is permanent, and you have to be careful what you say.\n\nIf a school shooting happens, it's not just about the students, it's about the entire school system. The officials are trying to ensure that the school is a safe place for everyone, and if that means monitoring online, I think that's okay. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done to keep people safe. I've had conversations with teachers about this, and they do regular lock-down drills and stuff to prepare for emergencies. It's not just about the school shooting, it's about being prepared for any situation.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online, I don't see a problem with it. They were just trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. That's all I've been trying to say.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation. At first, I was all for the decision to go to war, mainly because it was a personal issue for me following 9/11. I felt a strong desire to take action and make a difference, even if it meant causing some chaos in the process. However, looking back, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences. We just kind of rushed in without a clear plan, and it backfired on us.\n\nNow, I'm not just against the war; I think it actually did more harm than good. I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on working with us. It's like they're stuck in a never-ending cycle of conflict, and our presence isn't doing anything to change that. I've kind of lost interest in what's going on over there because of the way things have played out.\n\nSometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they conduct themselves in war. It's like they're more savage than civilized, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out. I think we should have left them to their own devices a long time ago.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war on a whim, driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, rather than a clear plan. The President might have thought he was doing the right thing, but looking back, I'm not so sure. We couldn't just let the situation go, but we could have handled it better. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and it showed. The lack of unity and a clear plan made things much harder for us.\n\nI don't think we're the right people to change those countries. They've been like that for a long time, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. In the end, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying; it's only a matter of time before things collapse once we leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church does need to adapt to some changes. They're losing followers, and I believe it's partly because they're not very open-minded about certain things. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which I think might be the problem. If they were to modernize their views a bit, I think they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard that people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of its stance on these issues. Some individuals are beginning to disagree with the Church's views, which is making them feel like the Church has the wrong perspective. The Church's stance on abortion, for example, might make it difficult for those who support it to feel comfortable following the Church's teachings.\n\nIt's also hard to understand why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think this would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing, but it's hard to say for sure. Perhaps if priests were allowed to be married, they might have made different choices, but it's hard to know for certain.\n\nOne thing that does make sense to me is that priests shouldn't be prevented from having a family life. Everyone else has a job and other loved ones, so why can't priests have both a career and a personal life? After all, the Church says priests are married to God, but that doesn't mean they can't have a personal life or devoted relationships with others.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it's wrong to hold them accountable for something they can't control.\n\nTo me, it doesn't seem like a choice, like someone could just decide to be straight or gay. People are either born straight or gay, and they shouldn't be judged for it. I mean, I was born straight, and I'm assuming other people are born the way they are too.\n\nI think it's unfair to make people feel like they've made a wrong choice just because of who they are. I don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue because it's not a matter of security or morality, it's just about people's personal lives. They shouldn't be telling people who they can or can't love.\n\nIt's not the government's place to interfere with people's relationships, especially when it comes to something as personal as their sexual orientation. I think it's just a matter of accepting people for who they are and not judging them.\n\nI'm not sure how to put it, but I think the government should stay out of it. It's not a security issue, it's not a moral issue, it's just about people living their lives. And I don't think they should be punished for being who they are.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but this is a misconception. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin - they're not the same, and it's unfair to treat them as such.\n\nOne of the main issues is that gay couples often don't have the same rights as straight couples. For example, if you're in a gay relationship and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you because they're not technically considered family. This seems pretty silly, especially if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nStudies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples, and they face the same challenges in their relationships. The main difference is that they're in love with someone of the same sex, but that doesn't make their relationship any less valid.\n\nThe thing is, gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church - they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. It's not about the church and state issue, it's about equal rights. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but equal is not the same thing. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships.\n\nPeople often worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are valid concerns. However, it's hard to say for sure how children of gay couples will adjust to society, especially in terms of their parents' sexual orientation. But this is a new area of study, and it's hard to make blanket statements.\n\nThe main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools. It's not about the parents' abilities, but about societal attitudes.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what's currently proposed. President Bush's views on gay marriage are likely influenced by his religious beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the country.\n\nLastly, it's ironic that some people are opposed to the idea of gay marriage while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of the country. It's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on the entire country, especially when it's not universally accepted. \n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and if people listened to research and studies instead of popular opinion, things might be different.",
            "Honestly, my job at the hospital pharmacy during the summer really opened my eyes to the benefits of certain substances. Just because something is considered taboo doesn't mean it's not helpful. I'm saying that if we're talking about making it available to the public, I'm definitely not in favor of that. But for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. The fact that a substance is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's not beneficial – it's all about perspective. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that we use all the time in pharmacies, like oxycontin and vicodin. They're controlled, but we still use them because they're helpful. So, why can't we do the same with marijuana, just because there's a stigma around it? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than dwelling on the negative. \n\nOne thing that bothers me is that people compare marijuana to alcohol, but it's not exactly the same. While abusing marijuana can have its downsides, so can abusing alcohol. It's a complex issue, and I don't think we should just outright ban it. Instead, I think we should take a step back and try to educate people about its benefits, and maybe even gradually introduce it in a controlled environment. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana, I think people will be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.\n\nIt's crazy how people's perception of marijuana is skewed because of its illegal status. They view it as this terrible substance, but it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's minds about marijuana, I think we'd see a more responsible approach to using it. And who knows, it could even be a game-changer for people in need of medical treatment.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, especially when it comes to its traditions and expectations. As someone who grew up attending church every Sunday, I can attest to this shift. I remember dressing up in cute outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse, every Sunday. It was a big part of my routine, especially since I attended a private school where I'd see my friends on weekends. The church even introduced a \"teenager mass\" that was significantly shorter, lasting only 30 minutes, and people started dressing more casually, even during summer when they'd come in straight from the beach. It's become a much more casual atmosphere, even during morning masses where I used to dress up. People now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from the more formal attire of my youth. This is probably the biggest thing I've noticed about the church.\n\nI don't think the church's stance on female priests or priests being allowed to marry would have prevented the allegations of pedophilia. There are still men who become pedophiles, even if they're married or part of other faiths that allow them to marry. It's not about the rules or restrictions, but about the individual's choices and desires. Plus, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and there are other religions that allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue to the Catholic Church. If someone wants to be a priest and be married, they might consider a different faith.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is more related to genetics than environmental factors. I don't think people just become pedophiles; they're born with these tendencies. While upbringing might play a small role, it's not the primary cause. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or other means. If the church knew about the allegations and tried to cover them up, that's a separate issue, but I don't think their stance on priests' marriages would have made a difference in preventing these cases.\n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any other thoughts to share on the matter.",
            "I was initially on board with the premise, but I think the world was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of events that led to the invasion, rather than a solid reason. The Bush administration linked the war in Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration just lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just a serious abuse of power in my opinion, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution since 9/11, and it seems like they always had plans to go to war.\n\nTo be honest, I think the younger Bush came into office with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and he was hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI do think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to problems since there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more deaths. The alternative of having the UN and the US work with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order doesn't seem like a good idea either. In the long run, it could create more problems because Iraq's sovereignty would be at issue, and it's clear that the interim government is faltering.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament isn't very effective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the government. Even the radical elements we were fighting last year, like Mugtada al-Sadr, now have a significant presence in the Parliament, causing more friction in the government.",
            "I'm not really sure about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's a pretty complex issue for me. I think a lot of people would agree that it's not really a declared war, but more of a retaliation against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and gain access to their oil resources. However, I'm not convinced this is a good reason to stay in Iraq, especially considering how it's causing so much tension and conflict. If we leave, Iraq will likely have to start from scratch, but if we stay, we'll be trying to impose our own democracy, which could take years and potentially make things worse. \n\nI'm not really sure what to think about this. I think it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families affected by it, but at the same time, I worry that our involvement is making things worse. It's a delicate balance between supporting the people of Iraq and respecting their culture, but also not trying to impose our own values on them. I fear that our interference could lead to more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida. I think this conflict will be ongoing for a long time, and it's hard to see a clear resolution.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as lawful. I believe it's up to the churches to decide this issue, given that the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This separation is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Making an amendment to restrict this would be contradictory to what's already been stated and written in the constitution.\n\nIn my opinion, even considering an amendment would be wrong, as it would be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't see why the government should be involved in this issue, except maybe because of the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. However, this is a clear example of the president showing preference for a particular religion over others.\n\nI think the churches should decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no real reason to support this amendment, other than personal views, and I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society. In any case, I've expressed my thoughts on this matter.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I think the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading Iraq, they linked the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government manipulated public emotions to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq war is a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways – the US government should've learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible. They removed the Iraqi government, but I don't think the US was prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The US was trying to establish a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they should've known it wouldn't be a smooth process.\n\nThe government should've planned for all possible outcomes, but it seems they weren't prepared for the long and difficult ordeal that ensued. Many American troops are still dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, which is a long and complex process. I think the US government made the American people believe it would be a short and successful engagement, but it's not that easy to establish a new form of government.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government made the decision to go to war in a way that was unrealistic and naive, considering the struggles we've faced in our own country to develop a democratic government. It's not something that can be done overnight, and it's not as easy as it seems. I think the government should've been more honest about the challenges they faced in Iraq.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you've been there for so long. We're the ones who removed their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them? But on the other hand, we can't keep risking American lives for an undetermined amount of time. The reason for invading Iraq was to establish a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? I think it's all about the oil issue and controlling resources. The fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, but we're not taking action against countries like North Korea, shows that the US government isn't being thorough or truthful in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, I don't think that's likely.",

I've always been, and I think it's essential that people are allowed to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives. With the growing amount of research showing that being gay could be determined by biology rather than social influences, it's hard to justify taking away people's rights based on something they can't control. \n\nTo me, it's inhumane to deny people the same rights as everyone else just because of their sexual orientation. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it's a personal matter that should be left out of politics. It's not about the state or the government; it's about individual freedom and the right to love who you want. \n\nTake my neighborhood back home for example - there are a few openly gay couples living there, but they're not married because they're not allowed to be. Despite that, they lead normal lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks and live their lives as they see fit. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush are trying to impose their own interpretation of marriage on everyone else. \n\nResearch has shown that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which can't be changed by upbringing or environment. It's not about how you're raised or your family dynamics; it's about who you are. \n\nOne of the main issues with gay marriage is that it's treated as a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it's front-page news. It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public debate and scrutiny. It's time for us to stop treating it like a national issue and let people make their own choices in peace.",
            "I don't know what to say, but when you put something online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've dealt with this issue before, and it's a big deal. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and if you're posting about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, people are going to take notice. Someone will inevitably say something or share it with someone who will act on it, and the school can't just ignore it because they might be able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough to know what to take seriously, though, because some people just joke around online. I've seen situations like the one at our school, where someone posted something that seemed like a joke but ended up being a serious issue. In this case, someone overheard someone making a comment at school, and it was reported. When we found out who the person was, their friends looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that could be misinterpreted. When you post things online, there's no private space; if you don't want people to see it, don't post it.\n\nYou can't control what people think, and you can't tell them what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media, but if something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's brought to their attention by someone you've given access to, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, I do think it's a bad idea for teachers to create fake social media accounts to monitor their students – that's not their place.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, so I wouldn't friend them on social media. If they post something online that I shouldn't see, I don't want to have to deal with it. That's not my responsibility, and it's not a connection I want to make.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, I believed that the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now just continuing the war for the sake of it, to prove our military strength. I'm not sure if the original motivations were even pure, considering George Bush's family history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn my opinion, if the goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason. But I think things have gotten off track. I believe we made our point in the first few months of the war, and starting it was a powerful statement in itself. However, continuing it for over a year or more just seems like a drawn-out ordeal.\n\nIf our purpose was to free a country from a tyrant's rule, I think that's a valid reason for war. But over time, it seems like our reasons have become distorted and misconceived. It's as if we're still fighting just to fight, and we want to avoid a decisive end or a victory. I genuinely think it's time to stop.\n\nWe've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be used to tackle our own issues like poverty and internal problems. Our economy is being drained for a cause that's no longer clear. War should not be a long-term part of our budget. We have pressing issues like public roads, schools, healthcare, and more that deserve funding.\n\nRight now, money is being spent on a war that's lost its purpose, and some of our citizens are sacrificing their lives. I think that's a tragic waste of resources.",
            "To clarify, I have a question. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, but I wanted to bring it up. Someone recently found out about a situation because they looked at someone's online profile on a site like Myspace. I think it's kind of a gray area, to be honest. If you post information online, it's pretty much available for anyone to see. On Myspace, for example, you have to add someone as a friend in order to see their profile, but by doing so, you're giving them permission to see your information. So, if someone looks at your profile, it's not really an invasion of privacy, per se.\n\nI mean, I think it's actually a good thing that they were able to see that information and potentially prevent a bad situation from happening. However, it raises some questions about whether it's right for someone to be constantly monitoring people's profiles to prevent something like that from happening. It's not feasible for one person to be watching everyone's profiles all the time, and it could lead to discrimination if they're only focusing on certain individuals.\n\nIt's a complicated issue, and I'm not really sure what the right answer is. I have a Facebook account, and it's a bit unsettling to know that there are people out there who can see information about me. I've heard stories about people getting information about others online and using it to contact them, which can be really creepy. It's hard to know who can see what, and it's a bit of a trade-off between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially after hearing about a guy on TV who was able to get a girl's screen name and contact information online and meet up with her in a short amount of time. It's a bit disturbing to think about how easy it is for people to get that kind of information. I've had people I don't know contact me on my Facebook and IM me, which can be a bit unnerving.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to stay in touch with my friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. My roommate was telling me about a situation at her high school where students were banned from having Myspace accounts, which I found a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or not, but it seems like the school shouldn't have had the authority to tell students what they can and can't do online.\n\nI'm not really sure what the solution is, but it's definitely something to think about.",
            "I'm a bit uncertain about what to say about the Iraq War, to be honest. I feel like I'm joining the bandwagon by criticizing it, and I don't want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start just to be vindicated later. However, it's not really a matter of being right or wrong anymore, but rather a general consensus that the war was a bad idea, apart from within the administration, which refuses to admit its mistakes. \n\nIf we look at polls conducted in the US, Iraq, and globally, we see that around 75-80% of the world's population believes the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view, and so do 70% of the US troops stationed there. It's clear that the war was a disaster from the start, and pulling out now won't be easy either. The situation is complex, and the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern states are too vast for administrations to understand.\n\nIt's ironic that the US thinks it can impose democracy on a region where it's not naturally accepted. The previous administration, and to some extent the current one, seems to think they can bring about change in a place that's not ready for it. I don't think anyone disputes Saddam's bad record, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. \n\nHonestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer. The administration might be coming up with hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons yet. If they want to withdraw gradually over several years, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't just leave now. According to statistics, 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do, and if we ask them, they'll make the decision for us. If things go wrong, we can say we were following their wishes.\n\nIn any case, if we decide to help after leaving, at least we'll be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the aggressors we are today.",
            "You know, I genuinely believe gender discrimination is still a widespread issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, but I think it's especially prevalent in certain professions. For instance, even though we're supposed to have equal opportunities, people often struggle to find a woman in a leadership position. This is largely due to the societal norms we've developed over time, where men are often expected to be in charge. As a result, women might have the qualifications for a particular job, but they may be overlooked for promotions simply because it's not customary for women to hold upper management positions. \n\nThe same issue applies to men in certain industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. It's still uncommon for men to stay at home and care for the kids, and society tends to view this as abnormal. People often assume that men should be the breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home may face criticism. It's hard for them because they might have always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives, and their partners might be the ones with better job prospects. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's also a problem with taking men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's because men who are into fashion often have different styles and preferences, and people might question their credibility in the field. They might think, \"If you're a man, how do I know you truly understand what women want in fashion?\" This can be a major obstacle for men in the industry.\n\nIt's tough to change these attitudes because societal norms are deeply ingrained, and we've made progress at a relatively slow pace. However, we're moving in the right direction. More women are taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs, which is helping to break down barriers. Similarly, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted as men realize that their partners might have better job prospects or a stronger work ethic.\n\nTo promote positive change, it's essential to showcase the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be too pushy or forceful, as this can lead to resistance. Instead, we should highlight their strengths and qualities, which can help shift people's perceptions. It's a delicate balance, but I think we're making progress, and change takes time.\n\nInterestingly, people from different backgrounds and with varying education levels can also face discrimination. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education might be overlooked for a CEO position because their grammar isn't perfect, even if they're extremely intelligent. Other men might look down on them, thinking, \"How can I trust you if you can't even put together a coherent sentence?\"\n\nSo, it's not just about gender; it's also about where you come from and how you communicate. It's a complex issue, and there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality.",
            "So, to clarify the current laws, they've decriminalized marijuana, which essentially downgrades the offense from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket. This means that you can get cited for it, but it won't lead to the same severe consequences as a full-blown drug charge. However, people still worry about the potential long-term effects on their future, as these won't necessarily disappear just because it's decriminalized.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that the costs associated with arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession can be quite high. It involves a lot of resources, including police time, court proceedings, and public defenders. In municipalities facing financial difficulties, some are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community needs.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal and open-minded place, seems to have found a balance that works for them. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've been able to allocate more resources towards public education, social programs, and other essential services. This approach seems to be a step in the right direction, as it acknowledges the financial and social aspects of the issue.\n\nOf course, there are valid concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use. If it were fully legalized, it could lead to increased usage, which might become a problem. However, it's also worth considering that marijuana's impact on people varies greatly, just like how individuals react to other substances. Some people can handle it responsibly, while others might struggle with its effects on their lifestyle.\n\nIn my opinion, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, but it's difficult to generalize how people will react. Ultimately, it's essential to acknowledge that individuals respond differently to substances, and we should focus on promoting responsible use and moderation.",
            "To be honest, I agree with the traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, as they have been doing things in the same way for a long time. On one hand, it's great to have roots in tradition, but on the other hand, it's essential to be open to change. I think a lot of Catholics believe they must attend church every week, and they're quite strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church judges those who don't strictly follow the doctrine and doesn't accept people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics.\n\nFor example, my parents, both of whom were Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their religions. This doesn't seem very tolerant, given the Catholic teaching of loving others. It's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. In my opinion, the Catholic Church's teachings tell people to do certain things, but their practices contradict these teachings because they're outdated. They stick with these outdated practices despite this contradiction.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily be a good idea, but I don't think it would prevent them from engaging in pedophilic behavior either. Pedophiles would likely still act on their impulses regardless of their marital status. It's a different situation altogether – they would likely still act on their desires, whether or not they're married.\n\nIn my view, those who abuse children will do so regardless of their marital status. It's not about being married or not; it's about the nature of the relationship. I don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these situations from happening. They would likely continue to occur despite any changes to the marriage policy.",
            "Honestly, I'm still on the fence about this topic... I haven't made up my mind yet, and I'm not sure if either side has a strong argument. What I do know is that this issue is super tricky - we're talking about the separation of church and state, and defining marriage in a way that won't offend anyone. That's tough to do. I think that all civil unions should be recognized, but I'm not convinced that marriage should be defined by the government, especially when it's a sacrament for some people. If it's just a matter of two people getting together, then it should be treated as a civil union, without the government getting involved in the specifics. And as for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people, a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push for it to become federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That just seems ridiculous. It's not a big enough issue to warrant amending the constitution. It's pretty simple, really - we shouldn't amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage. No way.",
            "Honestly, growing up in a Christian household made me look at homosexuality as a bit of a gray area. On one hand, I have many gay friends, which has given me a deeper understanding of the issue. However, I still don't entirely agree with the lifestyle. That being said, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter that the federal government should decide on its own. Instead, it should be up to individual states to make their own decisions.\n\nI think this is where democracy comes into play, as many states have different political leanings. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, so if you live in one, you're already aware of the local stance. I don't think it's right to disagree with the decision if a state chooses to legalize gay marriage, given that you chose to live there. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so I believe it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered that point. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I don't think President Bush should have the authority to dictate how the entire country feels about gay marriage. I believe it's the individual states that should decide whether to legalize it or not. I don't agree with his decision to ban it nationwide.\n\nIt just seems to me that Bush doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each state should run itself. In a couple of years, he'll be out of office, and if a Democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to leave it up to each individual state, as they'll be the ones living with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't agree.",
            "To be honest, I don't really get it, but let me break it down for you. Myspace is a public platform, right? It's like a bulletin board where you share your thoughts and experiences with others. If you post something on Myspace, you have to consider that others, including school officials, might see it. They might not even be looking for it under the school's name, but they could easily access it from their homes.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent school shootings or other potential threats, I think that's okay. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking online, I'm all for it. I mean, if they're just looking for students who are breaking the rules, like drinking or smoking, that's a different story. I think that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it to prevent harm, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nI know it's easy to express yourself more freely when you're writing, but when you're speaking, it's a different story. People often post things on Myspace without thinking about the consequences, and it can come back to haunt them. If you say something bad about someone in an email or post it online, it can be hard to take it back. It's like everything you do online is permanent, and you have to be careful what you say.\n\nIf a school shooting happens, it's not just about the students, it's about the entire school system. The officials are trying to ensure that the school is a safe place for everyone, and if that means monitoring online, I think that's okay. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done to keep people safe. I've had conversations with teachers about this, and they do regular lock-down drills and stuff to prepare for emergencies. It's not just about the school shooting, it's about being prepared for any situation.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online, I don't see a problem with it. They were just trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. That's all I've been trying to say.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation. At first, I was all for the decision to go to war, mainly because it was a personal issue for me following 9/11. I felt a strong desire to take action and make a difference, even if it meant causing some chaos in the process. However, looking back, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences. We just kind of rushed in without a clear plan, and it backfired on us.\n\nNow, I'm not just against the war; I think it actually did more harm than good. I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on working with us. It's like they're stuck in a never-ending cycle of conflict, and our presence isn't doing anything to change that. I've kind of lost interest in what's going on over there because of the way things have played out.\n\nSometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they conduct themselves in war. It's like they're more savage than civilized, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out. I think we should have left them to their own devices a long time ago.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war on a whim, driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, rather than a clear plan. The President might have thought he was doing the right thing, but looking back, I'm not so sure. We couldn't just let the situation go, but we could have handled it better. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and it showed. The lack of unity and a clear plan made things much harder for us.\n\nI don't think we're the right people to change those countries. They've been like that for a long time, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. In the end, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying; it's only a matter of time before things collapse once we leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church does need to adapt to some changes. They're losing followers, and I believe it's partly because they're not very open-minded about certain things. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which I think might be the problem. If they were to modernize their views a bit, I think they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard that people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of its stance on these issues. Some individuals are beginning to disagree with the Church's views, which is making them feel like the Church has the wrong perspective. The Church's stance on abortion, for example, might make it difficult for those who support it to feel comfortable following the Church's teachings.\n\nIt's also hard to understand why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think this would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing, but it's hard to say for sure. Perhaps if priests were allowed to be married, they might have made different choices, but it's hard to know for certain.\n\nOne thing that does make sense to me is that priests shouldn't be prevented from having a family life. Everyone else has a job and other loved ones, so why can't priests have both a career and a personal life? After all, the Church says priests are married to God, but that doesn't mean they can't have a personal life or devoted relationships with others.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it's wrong to hold them accountable for something they can't control.\n\nTo me, it doesn't seem like a choice, like someone could just decide to be straight or gay. People are either born straight or gay, and they shouldn't be judged for it. I mean, I was born straight, and I'm assuming other people are born the way they are too.\n\nI think it's unfair to make people feel like they've made a wrong choice just because of who they are. I don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue because it's not a matter of security or morality, it's just about people's personal lives. They shouldn't be telling people who they can or can't love.\n\nIt's not the government's place to interfere with people's relationships, especially when it comes to something as personal as their sexual orientation. I think it's just a matter of accepting people for who they are and not judging them.\n\nI'm not sure how to put it, but I think the government should stay out of it. It's not a security issue, it's not a moral issue, it's just about people living their lives. And I don't think they should be punished for being who they are.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but this is a misconception. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin - they're not the same, and it's unfair to treat them as such.\n\nOne of the main issues is that gay couples often don't have the same rights as straight couples. For example, if you're in a gay relationship and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you because they're not technically considered family. This seems pretty silly, especially if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nStudies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples, and they face the same challenges in their relationships. The main difference is that they're in love with someone of the same sex, but that doesn't make their relationship any less valid.\n\nThe thing is, gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church - they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. It's not about the church and state issue, it's about equal rights. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but equal is not the same thing. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships.\n\nPeople often worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are valid concerns. However, it's hard to say for sure how children of gay couples will adjust to society, especially in terms of their parents' sexual orientation. But this is a new area of study, and it's hard to make blanket statements.\n\nThe main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools. It's not about the parents' abilities, but about societal attitudes.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what's currently proposed. President Bush's views on gay marriage are likely influenced by his religious beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the country.\n\nLastly, it's ironic that some people are opposed to the idea of gay marriage while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of the country. It's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on the entire country, especially when it's not universally accepted. \n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and if people listened to research and studies instead of popular opinion, things might be different.",
            "Honestly, my job at the hospital pharmacy during the summer really opened my eyes to the benefits of certain substances. Just because something is considered taboo doesn't mean it's not helpful. I'm saying that if we're talking about making it available to the public, I'm definitely not in favor of that. But for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. The fact that a substance is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's not beneficial – it's all about perspective. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that we use all the time in pharmacies, like oxycontin and vicodin. They're controlled, but we still use them because they're helpful. So, why can't we do the same with marijuana, just because there's a stigma around it? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than dwelling on the negative. \n\nOne thing that bothers me is that people compare marijuana to alcohol, but it's not exactly the same. While abusing marijuana can have its downsides, so can abusing alcohol. It's a complex issue, and I don't think we should just outright ban it. Instead, I think we should take a step back and try to educate people about its benefits, and maybe even gradually introduce it in a controlled environment. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana, I think people will be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.\n\nIt's crazy how people's perception of marijuana is skewed because of its illegal status. They view it as this terrible substance, but it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's minds about marijuana, I think we'd see a more responsible approach to using it. And who knows, it could even be a game-changer for people in need of medical treatment.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, especially when it comes to its traditions and expectations. As someone who grew up attending church every Sunday, I can attest to this shift. I remember dressing up in cute outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse, every Sunday. It was a big part of my routine, especially since I attended a private school where I'd see my friends on weekends. The church even introduced a \"teenager mass\" that was significantly shorter, lasting only 30 minutes, and people started dressing more casually, even during summer when they'd come in straight from the beach. It's become a much more casual atmosphere, even during morning masses where I used to dress up. People now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from the more formal attire of my youth. This is probably the biggest thing I've noticed about the church.\n\nI don't think the church's stance on female priests or priests being allowed to marry would have prevented the allegations of pedophilia. There are still men who become pedophiles, even if they're married or part of other faiths that allow them to marry. It's not about the rules or restrictions, but about the individual's choices and desires. Plus, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and there are other religions that allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue to the Catholic Church. If someone wants to be a priest and be married, they might consider a different faith.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is more related to genetics than environmental factors. I don't think people just become pedophiles; they're born with these tendencies. While upbringing might play a small role, it's not the primary cause. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or other means. If the church knew about the allegations and tried to cover them up, that's a separate issue, but I don't think their stance on priests' marriages would have made a difference in preventing these cases.\n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any other thoughts to share on the matter.",
            "I was initially on board with the premise, but I think the world was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of events that led to the invasion, rather than a solid reason. The Bush administration linked the war in Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration just lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just a serious abuse of power in my opinion, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution since 9/11, and it seems like they always had plans to go to war.\n\nTo be honest, I think the younger Bush came into office with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and he was hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI do think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to problems since there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more deaths. The alternative of having the UN and the US work with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order doesn't seem like a good idea either. In the long run, it could create more problems because Iraq's sovereignty would be at issue, and it's clear that the interim government is faltering.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament isn't very effective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the government. Even the radical elements we were fighting last year, like Mugtada al-Sadr, now have a significant presence in the Parliament, causing more friction in the government.",
            "I'm not really sure about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's a pretty complex issue for me. I think a lot of people would agree that it's not really a declared war, but more of a retaliation against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and gain access to their oil resources. However, I'm not convinced this is a good reason to stay in Iraq, especially considering how it's causing so much tension and conflict. If we leave, Iraq will likely have to start from scratch, but if we stay, we'll be trying to impose our own democracy, which could take years and potentially make things worse. \n\nI'm not really sure what to think about this. I think it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families affected by it, but at the same time, I worry that our involvement is making things worse. It's a delicate balance between supporting the people of Iraq and respecting their culture, but also not trying to impose our own values on them. I fear that our interference could lead to more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida. I think this conflict will be ongoing for a long time, and it's hard to see a clear resolution.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as lawful. I believe it's up to the churches to decide this issue, given that the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This separation is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Making an amendment to restrict this would be contradictory to what's already been stated and written in the constitution.\n\nIn my opinion, even considering an amendment would be wrong, as it would be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't see why the government should be involved in this issue, except maybe because of the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. However, this is a clear example of the president showing preference for a particular religion over others.\n\nI think the churches should decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no real reason to support this amendment, other than personal views, and I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society. In any case, I've expressed my thoughts on this matter.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I think the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading Iraq, they linked the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government manipulated public emotions to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq war is a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways – the US government should've learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible. They removed the Iraqi government, but I don't think the US was prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The US was trying to establish a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they should've known it wouldn't be a smooth process.\n\nThe government should've planned for all possible outcomes, but it seems they weren't prepared for the long and difficult ordeal that ensued. Many American troops are still dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, which is a long and complex process. I think the US government made the American people believe it would be a short and successful engagement, but it's not that easy to establish a new form of government.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government made the decision to go to war in a way that was unrealistic and naive, considering the struggles we've faced in our own country to develop a democratic government. It's not something that can be done overnight, and it's not as easy as it seems. I think the government should've been more honest about the challenges they faced in Iraq.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you've been there for so long. We're the ones who removed their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them? But on the other hand, we can't keep risking American lives for an undetermined amount of time. The reason for invading Iraq was to establish a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? I think it's all about the oil issue and controlling resources. The fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, but we're not taking action against countries like North Korea, shows that the US government isn't being thorough or truthful in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, I don't think that's likely.",
            "Okay, so let's get this straight - I'm fully in support of gay marriage. I've always been, and I think it's essential that people are allowed to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives. With the growing amount of research showing that being gay could be determined by biology rather than social influences, it's hard to justify taking away people's rights based on something they can't control. \n\nTo me, it's inhumane to deny people the same rights as everyone else just because of their sexual orientation. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it's a personal matter that should be left out of politics. It's not about the state or the government; it's about individual freedom and the right to love who you want. \n\nTake my neighborhood back home for example - there are a few openly gay couples living there, but they're not married because they're not allowed to be. Despite that, they lead normal lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks and live their lives as they see fit. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush are trying to impose their own interpretation of marriage on everyone else. \n\nResearch has shown that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which can't be changed by upbringing or environment. It's not about how you're raised or your family dynamics; it's about who you are. \n\nOne of the main issues with gay marriage is that it's treated as a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it's front-page news. It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public debate and scrutiny. It's time for us to stop treating it like a national issue and let people make their own choices in peace.",
            "I don't know what to say, but when you put something online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've dealt with this issue before, and it's a big deal. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and if you're posting about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, people are going to take notice. Someone will inevitably say something or share it with someone who will act on it, and the school can't just ignore it because they might be able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough to know what to take seriously, though, because some people just joke around online. I've seen situations like the one at our school, where someone posted something that seemed like a joke but ended up being a serious issue. In this case, someone overheard someone making a comment at school, and it was reported. When we found out who the person was, their friends looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that could be misinterpreted. When you post things online, there's no private space; if you don't want people to see it, don't post it.\n\nYou can't control what people think, and you can't tell them what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media, but if something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's brought to their attention by someone you've given access to, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, I do think it's a bad idea for teachers to create fake social media accounts to monitor their students – that's not their place.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, so I wouldn't friend them on social media. If they post something online that I shouldn't see, I don't want to have to deal with it. That's not my responsibility, and it's not a connection I want to make.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, I believed that the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now just continuing the war for the sake of it, to prove our military strength. I'm not sure if the original motivations were even pure, considering George Bush's family history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn my opinion, if the goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason. But I think things have gotten off track. I believe we made our point in the first few months of the war, and starting it was a powerful statement in itself. However, continuing it for over a year or more just seems like a drawn-out ordeal.\n\nIf our purpose was to free a country from a tyrant's rule, I think that's a valid reason for war. But over time, it seems like our reasons have become distorted and misconceived. It's as if we're still fighting just to fight, and we want to avoid a decisive end or a victory. I genuinely think it's time to stop.\n\nWe've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be used to tackle our own issues like poverty and internal problems. Our economy is being drained for a cause that's no longer clear. War should not be a long-term part of our budget. We have pressing issues like public roads, schools, healthcare, and more that deserve funding.\n\nRight now, money is being spent on a war that's lost its purpose, and some of our citizens are sacrificing their lives. I think that's a tragic waste of resources.",
            "To clarify, I have a question. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, but I wanted to bring it up. Someone recently found out about a situation because they looked at someone's online profile on a site like Myspace. I think it's kind of a gray area, to be honest. If you post information online, it's pretty much available for anyone to see. On Myspace, for example, you have to add someone as a friend in order to see their profile, but by doing so, you're giving them permission to see your information. So, if someone looks at your profile, it's not really an invasion of privacy, per se.\n\nI mean, I think it's actually a good thing that they were able to see that information and potentially prevent a bad situation from happening. However, it raises some questions about whether it's right for someone to be constantly monitoring people's profiles to prevent something like that from happening. It's not feasible for one person to be watching everyone's profiles all the time, and it could lead to discrimination if they're only focusing on certain individuals.\n\nIt's a complicated issue, and I'm not really sure what the right answer is. I have a Facebook account, and it's a bit unsettling to know that there are people out there who can see information about me. I've heard stories about people getting information about others online and using it to contact them, which can be really creepy. It's hard to know who can see what, and it's a bit of a trade-off between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially after hearing about a guy on TV who was able to get a girl's screen name and contact information online and meet up with her in a short amount of time. It's a bit disturbing to think about how easy it is for people to get that kind of information. I've had people I don't know contact me on my Facebook and IM me, which can be a bit unnerving.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to stay in touch with my friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. My roommate was telling me about a situation at her high school where students were banned from having Myspace accounts, which I found a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or not, but it seems like the school shouldn't have had the authority to tell students what they can and can't do online.\n\nI'm not really sure what the solution is, but it's definitely something to think about.",
            "I'm a bit uncertain about what to say about the Iraq War, to be honest. I feel like I'm joining the bandwagon by criticizing it, and I don't want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start just to be vindicated later. However, it's not really a matter of being right or wrong anymore, but rather a general consensus that the war was a bad idea, apart from within the administration, which refuses to admit its mistakes. \n\nIf we look at polls conducted in the US, Iraq, and globally, we see that around 75-80% of the world's population believes the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view, and so do 70% of the US troops stationed there. It's clear that the war was a disaster from the start, and pulling out now won't be easy either. The situation is complex, and the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern states are too vast for administrations to understand.\n\nIt's ironic that the US thinks it can impose democracy on a region where it's not naturally accepted. The previous administration, and to some extent the current one, seems to think they can bring about change in a place that's not ready for it. I don't think anyone disputes Saddam's bad record, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. \n\nHonestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer. The administration might be coming up with hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons yet. If they want to withdraw gradually over several years, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't just leave now. According to statistics, 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do, and if we ask them, they'll make the decision for us. If things go wrong, we can say we were following their wishes.\n\nIn any case, if we decide to help after leaving, at least we'll be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the aggressors we are today.",
            "You know, I genuinely believe gender discrimination is still a widespread issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, but I think it's especially prevalent in certain professions. For instance, even though we're supposed to have equal opportunities, people often struggle to find a woman in a leadership position. This is largely due to the societal norms we've developed over time, where men are often expected to be in charge. As a result, women might have the qualifications for a particular job, but they may be overlooked for promotions simply because it's not customary for women to hold upper management positions. \n\nThe same issue applies to men in certain industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. It's still uncommon for men to stay at home and care for the kids, and society tends to view this as abnormal. People often assume that men should be the breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home may face criticism. It's hard for them because they might have always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives, and their partners might be the ones with better job prospects. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's also a problem with taking men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's because men who are into fashion often have different styles and preferences, and people might question their credibility in the field. They might think, \"If you're a man, how do I know you truly understand what women want in fashion?\" This can be a major obstacle for men in the industry.\n\nIt's tough to change these attitudes because societal norms are deeply ingrained, and we've made progress at a relatively slow pace. However, we're moving in the right direction. More women are taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs, which is helping to break down barriers. Similarly, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted as men realize that their partners might have better job prospects or a stronger work ethic.\n\nTo promote positive change, it's essential to showcase the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be too pushy or forceful, as this can lead to resistance. Instead, we should highlight their strengths and qualities, which can help shift people's perceptions. It's a delicate balance, but I think we're making progress, and change takes time.\n\nInterestingly, people from different backgrounds and with varying education levels can also face discrimination. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education might be overlooked for a CEO position because their grammar isn't perfect, even if they're extremely intelligent. Other men might look down on them, thinking, \"How can I trust you if you can't even put together a coherent sentence?\"\n\nSo, it's not just about gender; it's also about where you come from and how you communicate. It's a complex issue, and there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality.",
            "So, to clarify the current laws, they've decriminalized marijuana, which essentially downgrades the offense from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket. This means that you can get cited for it, but it won't lead to the same severe consequences as a full-blown drug charge. However, people still worry about the potential long-term effects on their future, as these won't necessarily disappear just because it's decriminalized.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that the costs associated with arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession can be quite high. It involves a lot of resources, including police time, court proceedings, and public defenders. In municipalities facing financial difficulties, some are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community needs.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal and open-minded place, seems to have found a balance that works for them. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've been able to allocate more resources towards public education, social programs, and other essential services. This approach seems to be a step in the right direction, as it acknowledges the financial and social aspects of the issue.\n\nOf course, there are valid concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use. If it were fully legalized, it could lead to increased usage, which might become a problem. However, it's also worth considering that marijuana's impact on people varies greatly, just like how individuals react to other substances. Some people can handle it responsibly, while others might struggle with its effects on their lifestyle.\n\nIn my opinion, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, but it's difficult to generalize how people will react. Ultimately, it's essential to acknowledge that individuals respond differently to substances, and we should focus on promoting responsible use and moderation.",
            "To be honest, I agree with the traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, as they have been doing things in the same way for a long time. On one hand, it's great to have roots in tradition, but on the other hand, it's essential to be open to change. I think a lot of Catholics believe they must attend church every week, and they're quite strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church judges those who don't strictly follow the doctrine and doesn't accept people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics.\n\nFor example, my parents, both of whom were Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their religions. This doesn't seem very tolerant, given the Catholic teaching of loving others. It's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. In my opinion, the Catholic Church's teachings tell people to do certain things, but their practices contradict these teachings because they're outdated. They stick with these outdated practices despite this contradiction.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily be a good idea, but I don't think it would prevent them from engaging in pedophilic behavior either. Pedophiles would likely still act on their impulses regardless of their marital status. It's a different situation altogether – they would likely still act on their desires, whether or not they're married.\n\nIn my view, those who abuse children will do so regardless of their marital status. It's not about being married or not; it's about the nature of the relationship. I don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these situations from happening. They would likely continue to occur despite any changes to the marriage policy.",
            "Honestly, I'm still on the fence about this topic... I haven't made up my mind yet, and I'm not sure if either side has a strong argument. What I do know is that this issue is super tricky - we're talking about the separation of church and state, and defining marriage in a way that won't offend anyone. That's tough to do. I think that all civil unions should be recognized, but I'm not convinced that marriage should be defined by the government, especially when it's a sacrament for some people. If it's just a matter of two people getting together, then it should be treated as a civil union, without the government getting involved in the specifics. And as for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people, a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push for it to become federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That just seems ridiculous. It's not a big enough issue to warrant amending the constitution. It's pretty simple, really - we shouldn't amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage. No way.",
            "Honestly, growing up in a Christian household made me look at homosexuality as a bit of a gray area. On one hand, I have many gay friends, which has given me a deeper understanding of the issue. However, I still don't entirely agree with the lifestyle. That being said, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter that the federal government should decide on its own. Instead, it should be up to individual states to make their own decisions.\n\nI think this is where democracy comes into play, as many states have different political leanings. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, so if you live in one, you're already aware of the local stance. I don't think it's right to disagree with the decision if a state chooses to legalize gay marriage, given that you chose to live there. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so I believe it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered that point. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I don't think President Bush should have the authority to dictate how the entire country feels about gay marriage. I believe it's the individual states that should decide whether to legalize it or not. I don't agree with his decision to ban it nationwide.\n\nIt just seems to me that Bush doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each state should run itself. In a couple of years, he'll be out of office, and if a Democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to leave it up to each individual state, as they'll be the ones living with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't agree.",
            "To be honest, I don't really get it, but let me break it down for you. Myspace is a public platform, right? It's like a bulletin board where you share your thoughts and experiences with others. If you post something on Myspace, you have to consider that others, including school officials, might see it. They might not even be looking for it under the school's name, but they could easily access it from their homes.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent school shootings or other potential threats, I think that's okay. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking online, I'm all for it. I mean, if they're just looking for students who are breaking the rules, like drinking or smoking, that's a different story. I think that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it to prevent harm, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nI know it's easy to express yourself more freely when you're writing, but when you're speaking, it's a different story. People often post things on Myspace without thinking about the consequences, and it can come back to haunt them. If you say something bad about someone in an email or post it online, it can be hard to take it back. It's like everything you do online is permanent, and you have to be careful what you say.\n\nIf a school shooting happens, it's not just about the students, it's about the entire school system. The officials are trying to ensure that the school is a safe place for everyone, and if that means monitoring online, I think that's okay. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done to keep people safe. I've had conversations with teachers about this, and they do regular lock-down drills and stuff to prepare for emergencies. It's not just about the school shooting, it's about being prepared for any situation.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online, I don't see a problem with it. They were just trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. That's all I've been trying to say.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation. At first, I was all for the decision to go to war, mainly because it was a personal issue for me following 9/11. I felt a strong desire to take action and make a difference, even if it meant causing some chaos in the process. However, looking back, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences. We just kind of rushed in without a clear plan, and it backfired on us.\n\nNow, I'm not just against the war; I think it actually did more harm than good. I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on working with us. It's like they're stuck in a never-ending cycle of conflict, and our presence isn't doing anything to change that. I've kind of lost interest in what's going on over there because of the way things have played out.\n\nSometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they conduct themselves in war. It's like they're more savage than civilized, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out. I think we should have left them to their own devices a long time ago.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war on a whim, driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, rather than a clear plan. The President might have thought he was doing the right thing, but looking back, I'm not so sure. We couldn't just let the situation go, but we could have handled it better. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and it showed. The lack of unity and a clear plan made things much harder for us.\n\nI don't think we're the right people to change those countries. They've been like that for a long time, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. In the end, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying; it's only a matter of time before things collapse once we leave."
