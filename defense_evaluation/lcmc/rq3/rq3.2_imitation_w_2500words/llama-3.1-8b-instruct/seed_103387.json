            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few areas. Their views on certain issues are not really in tune with the times, and that's one reason why they're losing followers. For instance, they have strong opinions on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, but these views seem a bit outdated. If the Church adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these issues, and that's causing them to lose faith. If you're pro-choice on abortion or support gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable following a Church that views these things as wrong. It's the same with other issues where the Church's views clash with your own. \n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's not like having a family life would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church. I mean, just because priests are married to God doesn't mean they can't have a life outside of their vocation. Everyone else has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?\n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to devote their entire lives to their work, with no personal life. I think it would be more realistic and healthy for them to have both a career and a family. It's not like they're asking for the world; they just want a bit of balance in their lives.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for who they are. It doesn't make sense to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a matter of choice; they're just born with their orientation. I'm not sure I've thought it through, but it does seem wrong to me that some people are denied the right to marry because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems that being gay isn't something people choose; it's just how they are. I was born straight, and people are born with different orientations, so it's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue; it's not a legal or moral issue, but rather a personal one. I don't think it's fair to judge or punish people for who they are.\n\nIt's hard for me to put into words, but I think the federal government should stay out of it. This isn't a matter of national security or morality; it's just a personal aspect of people's lives. They shouldn't have the right to interfere or judge people based on their sexual orientation. It's who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but that's just not the case. It's apples and oranges; they're two different things with different aspects.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin - heads and tails are never going to be the same, but they're still part of the same coin. Same-sex couples have the same basic rights as straight couples, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick, and they can't visit because they're not technically considered family. It's a pretty silly reason to deny someone's partner the right to be with them in a time of need.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as straight couples. At the end of the day, it's just a relationship - the same thing. Where people get hung up is on the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they're asking for a marriage certificate from the government. If you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as straight couples, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. The real issue is that some people are uncomfortable with the idea of same-sex relationships, and that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights.\n\nPeople worry about the impact on children, but that's a complex issue. Some people think that children of same-sex couples will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, but that's just not true. Children are influenced by their parents' values and parenting skills, not their orientation. And just like straight couples, gay couples can be good parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment against it should be repealed. President Bush has his own views on gay marriage, which are based on his religious beliefs, but that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights. The government should be more inclusive and not impose its own moral views on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not supported by research, and people should listen to experts, not just their opinions or cultural norms. If we listened to institutions that have actually studied these issues, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have some beneficial properties. I mean, as far as making it available to the public, I'm absolutely against it. I don't think that's a good idea. But, for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. If we dismiss something just because it's not allowed, that's not fair. There are plenty of controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, that we use all the time in the pharmacy because they're beneficial, even though they're not exactly legal. We shouldn't be denying the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it. I think we should be embracing its potential benefits.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol. I mean, if you overuse marijuana, it can have negative consequences, just like with alcohol. It's a tough issue. I think the key is to integrate it gradually, rather than making it legal all at once. If we did that, it might get abused, but if we can first remove the negative image associated with marijuana, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nYou see, people have this really bad perception of marijuana because it's an illicit substance. But, it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. I think if we can change the way people view marijuana, they might be more likely to use it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I've noticed this firsthand, especially when I attend church services. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday and dress up in matching outfits, including cute dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal, and I felt like it was a special occasion. However, as I've grown older, the church has started to adapt to the changing times. They've even introduced a 30-minute mass for teenagers, which has become more casual. People now wear jeans and khakis, even during morning masses, which was previously a time for more formal attire.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift in the overall atmosphere. The church I'm familiar with has become more relaxed, and it's not as formal as it used to be. I'm not aware of the church's politics, but I think this is a good thing.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who become pedophiles regardless of their marital status, and their attraction to young children is not something that can be altered by marriage or other external factors. I think it's a personal choice to become a priest, and if someone wants to be married while practicing their faith, they might consider a different denomination that allows it, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church. I don't think the church's stance on marriage or celibacy is the root cause of the problem.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is largely determined by genetics. People are born with certain inclinations, and it's not something that can be changed through upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some instances may be influenced by environmental factors, I believe that genetics play a significant role. Trying to hide or suppress these tendencies through marriage or other means is unlikely to be effective in the long run. If the church was aware of these situations and chose to cover them up, that's unacceptable, but I don't think they could have prevented the problem in the first place.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point, but I appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective on this sensitive issue.",
            "Honestly, I initially agreed with the premise, but I have to admit that the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was a really volatile time, and I think we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext to address some other issues that were already on the table. The Bush administration was quick to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false. That really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war has always been a sensitive topic for me.\n\nTo me, it seems like the Bush administration has been flagrantly lying to the American people, and they've yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented that infamous UN speech, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. It's like they're trying to get away with malfeasance in office, which I think is a serious offense that should be impeachable. They seem to have this disregard for the constitution and have been trying to undermine it since 9/11, at least.\n\nI think they came into office with a predetermined plan to go to war, and the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his dad's administration. He might have been hoping to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nWhile I think it's time to get out of Iraq, I'm aware that withdrawing now could lead to chaos and more deaths as the country teeters on the brink of civil war. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, might not be the best idea either, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create more problems in the long run.\n\nThe Iraqi government seems ineffective, and from what I've seen, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, especially with parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's holding sway. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.",
            "You know, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq, and I'm not sure where I stand on it. To be honest, it's all kind of confusing, but I guess my main feeling is that it's pointless, or at least it doesn't feel like it's going anywhere. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, so it's hard to really understand what's going on.\n\nI think it was kind of like a response to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being involved. But now, it feels like we're just stuck there trying to build democracy, which is a long-term goal, and it's hard to see how it's actually making things better. Plus, we're also interested in getting oil from them, which doesn't seem like a good reason to be there.\n\nThe thing is, if we leave, Iraq will be upset, but if we stay, it's going to take forever to build a stable democracy, and it's going to be hard to leave without messing things up even more. And if we keep trying to impose our values on them, it's going to create more problems, like more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida.\n\nIt's all really complicated, and I don't know what the best solution is. I guess I'm just worried that it's going to drag on for years and years, and it's not going to end well. That's pretty much my take on it.\n\nAs for calling it a war, I don't think that's even accurate. I mean, it wasn't declared by Congress, so it doesn't feel like a real war to me. And it's hard to justify staying there when it's causing so much suffering and destruction.\n\nBut at the same time, I know there are families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I feel for them. It's hard to know what to do, because I don't want to see anyone get hurt, but I also don't want us to be stuck in a situation that's not making things better.\n\nI guess that's my take on it. It's all just really complicated, and I don't know what the answer is.",
            "Honestly, I think it's unfair for a government to make laws based on religious beliefs. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle in the constitution, and it's clearly stated that the government should not interfere with church matters. I believe that trying to enforce laws based on one church's views would be a direct contradiction to this principle.\n\nIt seems to me that those pushing for a ban on a certain issue are essentially favoring one church over others. For example, most Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, but there are some exceptions. However, I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't allow.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for religious tolerance and freedom. Given that an amendment is being proposed, I think it's misguided and contradictory to the existing laws. It would be one of the few amendments intended to restrict individuals rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs, and it's unfair to impose his views on others. Every religion should have the freedom to make its own decisions, and it's up to the churches to decide what's right for them, not the government.\n\nI don't see any solid reason for the amendment, other than personal opinions. It's not clear how it would impact the economy or society in a positive way. In fact, it might even have a beneficial effect by promoting a more open and accepting society. I think I've said all I need to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq has left me with many unanswered questions. I think the US government may not have been entirely honest with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. They attempted to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks, which didn't necessarily have a direct connection. This emotional manipulation of the public's sentiment may have contributed to the invasion in 2003. As someone who's generally against going to war, especially preemptive strikes, I think the parallels between the Iraq war and the Vietnam War are striking. The US government seemed to disregard the lessons learned from past mistakes, resulting in a tremendous loss of American lives.\n\nThe invasion and removal of the Iraqi government were poorly planned, and the US didn't anticipate the chaos and power vacuum that would follow. They're now trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their attempts in Vietnam to oust Communists and install democracy. However, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process, not a quick, clear victory.\n\nIt's almost impossible to win against an entire nation's population when fighting insurgents, as opposed to a conventional army. I think the government underestimated the difficulty of this task and didn't prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. It's been almost a decade since the invasion, and we're still there, struggling to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to secure their own country. I believe the government has been naive in thinking this would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and arduous process, with many struggles and civil wars along the way. The US government made it seem like establishing democracy in Iraq would be relatively easy, which was a misleading message. It's a difficult decision to make, especially considering the long-term commitment required to establish a stable government.\n\nThe idea of abandoning Iraq now, after removing their government and disrupting their way of life, is a moral dilemma. We should try to see this through, but on the other hand, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify the risks involved. It seems to me that the real reason for invading Iraq was to control its oil resources, rather than to spread democracy. The lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a key factor in the decision to invade, yet countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, weren't targeted.\n\nI just hope the war in Iraq ends soon and that there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, it's unlikely to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and state my opinion on gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. To be honest, I always have been. I think it comes down to personal preference, and it's been proven that it's not just a matter of environment, but also biology. So, it's unfair to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI believe it's inhumane to do so, and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. In my opinion, the government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal decision that affects individuals and their families, not the state.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family would. They walk their dogs, interact with their neighbors, and go about their daily lives just like everyone else. It's not right that President Bush thinks he can interpret what marriage means and dictate it to everyone else.\n\nI think it's ridiculous when you consider that research has shown that there may be a biological component to being gay, rather than it being a product of environment or upbringing. It's not just about the number of siblings you have or the presence of a father figure - there are actual chemical factors at play.\n\nIf a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately without anyone's knowledge, but if a same-sex couple wants to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "I mean, seriously, when you post something online, it's a public platform. It's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. You put something out there, and it's going to influence how people perceive you. Talking about violent or disturbing topics can spark people's reactions, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, they'll see that bulletin. It's not the school that receives the bulletin; someone else shares it, and they have to take action. They can't just ignore it, or who knows, something bad might happen, and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's tough to know what's serious and what's just a joke. Take the incident we had on campus, for instance. It might have been a sociology experiment gone wrong or a genuine threat. Either way, when people heard about it, they were worried. When you share stuff online, there's no invasion of privacy; if you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. It's not like you can dictate how others perceive you.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media platforms or snoop through their profiles. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously. It's not the same as monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IMs. If a teacher creates a fake account to befriend students, that's crossing a line. I wouldn't do that as an R.A. because I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially if they're posting pictures of themselves having fun. That's not my concern, and I shouldn't have to deal with it.",
            "I feel that the war has been dragging on for too long. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble goal. However, it seems that we've lost sight of this purpose and are now just going through the motions to prove our strength as a superpower. I also wonder if the original motivation was tainted by George Bush's personal vendetta with Saddam Hussein, given his father's previous conflicts with him. If the war was meant to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that personal agendas were involved.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the first few months of the war, and that was a significant statement in itself. But continuing to fight for over a year or multiple years is just too prolonged. If our goal was to free a country from tyranny, that's a noble purpose, but I think our reasoning has been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting.\n\nI believe it's time for us to bring this war to an end. Our government officials should be able to fend for themselves by now. We're wasting billions of dollars on a war that's been dragging on for too long, while we have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare. It's time to redirect that money towards our own problems, rather than continuing to hemorrhage it in a foreign conflict that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe money being spent on war could be better used to fund essential public services, like education, healthcare, and public transportation. The fact that our citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost its way is unacceptable. I think that's the main issue here.",
            "I was wondering if you could clarify something for me. I was thinking about this situation where someone actually prevented a potentially bad situation from happening because they found out about it online. Apparently, it was because someone had discovered the information on a social media website like Myspace.\n\nOkay, so, I was thinking, if you post something online, it's pretty much public information, right? On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends with them, you're basically giving them permission to see your stuff. It's kind of like that when you put anything online, you're kind of open to everyone seeing it.\n\nI have to admit, I think it's actually good that someone was able to see that information and prevent something bad from happening. But, on the other hand, it's a tough situation because you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent bad things from happening. That would be like some kind of profiling, which isn't fair. But, at the same time, if someone is looking for information and they happen to stumble upon something that indicates someone is planning something bad, it's a different story.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's kind of weird to think about how much information is out there about you online, and how easily someone can access it. I've heard stories about people being able to find out all sorts of personal information about people online, which is pretty scary. For example, I saw a TV show about someone who was able to find out a girl's screen name and start talking to her on instant messenger, and she ended up meeting with him. It's crazy to think about how easily that can happen.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because, on the one hand, you want to be able to connect with your friends online, but on the other hand, you don't want to put yourself out there for everyone to see. I've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, that's kind of the point of having social media, right? It's a delicate balance.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she mentioned that her high school actually banned Myspace, which seemed weird to me. I'm not sure how they had the right to do that, and it's not really a privacy issue, but it's still kind of strange.\n\nThat's my take on it, I guess.",
            "I don't know how to start this but I guess I should mention the Iraq War one more time. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up, but I was against it from the start, and I'm not sure why it's not that important anymore. Everyone's just kind of accepted that it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who won't admit they were wrong. It's clear when you look at the polls - in the US, Iraq, and globally, around 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops think it was a dumb idea and we should leave within a year. I just think it's been a disaster from the start, and now it's hard to see how we can get out without causing another mess. \n\nIt's all about the huge cultural gap between the US and the Middle East. I don't think we can impose democracy on a place where it's not wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but we have to weigh the pros and cons before invading. It was clear that we'd just create a disaster, like quicksand. I don't really see a reason for us to stay anymore - I haven't heard any legitimate reasons from the administration that make sense to me. If they want to leave gradually, I'm okay with that, but I just don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, it's worth listening to their opinions. At least if we ask and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. It would be better if we were seen as trying to help, rather than just being there for our own reasons.",
            "You know, I really think there's still a lot of gender bias in the United States. I mean, it's not just a women's issue, but it's more prevalent in certain industries, like the ones we work in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where people have a hard time accepting that women can be in charge or have authority. It's just how society has been conditioned for so long. In the workplace, women often have the qualifications and skills, but they're not always promoted to the top positions because people are used to seeing men in those roles.\n\nIt's not just women, though, because men can face prejudice too, especially when it comes to things like stay-at-home parenting. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and raise their kids, like it's not what men are supposed to do. They should be the breadwinners, right? But sometimes that's not what works best for the family, and it can be really tough on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's a bit different, but there's still a problem. People might not take guys who are into fashion seriously, especially if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's like, if you're a guy who likes fashion, people might think you're not really understanding what women go through. They might not take your opinions seriously because you're not part of the \"typical\" male style.\n\nAnyway, I feel like gender bias is a big issue, and it's hard to change because people have a set way of thinking. We've come a long way, but it's still slow going. I think if we keep working at the pace we are now, with women getting more into leadership positions and being accepted in business, it'll happen eventually. People will start to realize that men can be stay-at-home dads too, and that guys can be into fashion and still be taken seriously.\n\nI guess the key is to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped, but not be pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now where people are starting to get it. We've made progress, and change takes time, so I'm not sure what more we can do at this point.\n\nOh, and it's not just men and women – people can be biased against each other depending on their background, education, and even where they're from. Like, if someone's not from a city, they might get looked down on because of their grammar or accent. It's a complex issue, but I think it's worth talking about.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. That means it got bumped down from a serious offense to more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested. I think this can be a good thing, as it reduces the harsh consequences people face from a marijuana charge, especially for jobs and other important stuff. However, it's worth noting that even if it's decriminalized, there are still potential long-term effects to worry about. On the other hand, some argue that it's costly to arrest and process people for marijuana possession, and that the money saved could be better spent on other important things. \n\nIn places with a more open-minded attitude, like Denver, it seems like decriminalization has worked out well, allowing them to free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. Of course, there are still valid concerns about marijuana being available everywhere, and some people worry about the impact on society and individual behavior. I'm not sure how I feel about full legalization, but I do think it's an issue with complex pros and cons. For example, if it were fully legalized, it might lead to more people smoking and driving, which would be a problem. Plus, some people are still uncomfortable with the idea of marijuana being out in the open. In my opinion, alcohol has more significant effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more profound impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, it's hard to make generalizations about substances because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. So, it's a tough issue to tackle.",
            "To be honest, I agree \nBecause \nQuite frankly, many things they do are steeped in tradition \nThings that have been done in a very specific way for a long time \nAnd \nIt's great to have roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe in regular church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel that the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the rules precisely \nAnd \nThey often don't accept people who aren't perfectly devout Catholics, nor those from other faiths \nFor instance \nMy parents were a Catholic and an Episcopalian, and they weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith \n\nWhich \nIsn't really \nAbout being tolerant of other beliefs \nWe've always been taught to \nLove others, a fundamental Catholic principle \nHowever, it seems hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while excluding others \nThat's a major issue with some Catholic doctrine and practice \nIt's outdated, but they continue to follow it anyway \n\nHonestly, I don't think that would necessarily make a difference \nPersonally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to marry \nBut \nI don't think that would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior \nIt's a different issue altogether \nSo, I'm not sure if that would be an issue \n\nTo be honest, people who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status \nChildren are different from spouses, so \nIf someone is inclined to harm children, they probably would do it regardless of whether they're married \nAllowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents, as they would likely happen anyway \n\nNo, I don't think so",
            "Alright, I don't know what I think about this one... I'm still trying to make up my mind. It's a really tricky topic, and I'm not sure if either side is entirely right or wrong. The thing is, separating church and state can be tough, and defining marriage is even harder. It's a whole can of worms, and it's hard to resolve it without offending anyone.\n\nThe thing is, what is marriage? Is it a sacrament, or is it just a civil union? If it's a sacrament, then the government shouldn't really care about it. I mean, people who are baptized get tax breaks and other benefits, so why not married people too? And if you're married, it's just a civil union, right? Two people coming together, living together, and sharing their lives.\n\nBut then there's gay marriage. It's just two people, right? They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else. If all the states can agree on this, then it should be a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Come on, that's just not necessary. It's not a big enough deal to warrant amending the constitution.\n\nIt's just a matter of defining what marriage is and letting people live their lives. It's not worth messing with the constitution over. So, to answer your question, I don't have a clear stance on this one yet. I need some more time to think about it.",
            "Alright, I'll be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and when it comes to homosexuality, it's a bit of a complicated issue for me. On one hand, I have many gay friends and I care about them deeply, but on the other hand, I'm not entirely in agreement with the lifestyle. However, I strongly believe that it should be legalized and not made a national issue. Instead, I think it should be up to each individual state to decide for themselves. \n\nI mean, we have democratic and republican states, and it's only natural that democratic states would be more open to gay marriage. If you live in a state that leans one way or the other, I think you should respect the decision of that state. After all, you chose to live there, so it's only fair that you accept the values and laws that come with it. I believe that everyone, regardless of orientation, deserves equal opportunities, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage. \n\nAs for the current president's stance on the issue, I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't have the power to dictate how each one runs itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, and this is one of them. Plus, his term is limited, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's the states that'll have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I think this is a matter that should be left to the states, not the federal government.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor what students post online. I mean, Myspace is a public platform, after all. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that others, including school officials, might see it. Even if you're not posting under the school's name, there's nothing stopping them from accessing it from their own homes. With school safety being a top priority, I think it's reasonable for officials to keep an eye out for content that might indicate students are engaging in risky behavior, like underage drinking or smoking. \n\nNow, I'm not saying it's cool for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students and get them in trouble. But if they're using online monitoring as a tool to prevent harm and keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's kind of like when parents drop off their kids at school and expect it to be a safe environment - they want to know that the school is taking steps to prevent problems like bullying or violence. I've discussed this with a teacher before, and they told me that schools have to take proactive measures to ensure student safety, like lockdown drills and emergency preparedness. It's all about making the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nI know some people might see this as an invasion of privacy, but I don't think it's unreasonable for schools to be vigilant about student safety. After all, everything you post online can come back to haunt you, and I'd rather err on the side of caution. I mean, think about it - if you do something questionable as a college student, it can come back to bite you years later when you're a successful person. \n\nSo yeah, I think it's a public thing, and if school officials are using online monitoring to keep students safe, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Of course, it's not about going on the internet just to catch students - it's about using any available tools to prevent harm and make the school a better place. That's basically my take on it.",
            "Honestly, I've had a change of heart about the war. At first, I supported it because I was deeply affected by the events of 9/11 and wanted to see the perpetrators brought to justice. I was so caught up in my emotions that I didn't think through the long-term consequences. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, and I think that was a huge mistake. It's clear that our actions backfired, and I'm now strongly against the war.\n\nIn my opinion, the people we're fighting don't care about us as long as they're fighting among themselves. It's pointless for us to be over there, trying to impose our will on them when they can't even get along with each other. Our presence in their country has only caused more problems, and I've come to realize that I just don't care what happens over there.\n\nI sometimes wonder if they're even capable of being human, given their brutal approach to war. It seems like they're more interested in driving us out than in improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them sort out their own issues.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war in a state of emotional frenzy, driven by a desire for revenge. We weren't thinking clearly about the potential consequences or how the Iraqis would react to our presence. We were more focused on seeking payback than on creating a better future for them.\n\nIn retrospect, I think President Bush should have had a clearer plan and a more rational approach. We couldn't just ignore the threat posed by Iraq and expect everything to go back to normal. However, I believe we could have achieved more if we had a better strategy and a stronger understanding of what we were trying to accomplish.\n\nThe lack of unity and clear goals on our part only made things worse, and I think that's a crucial lesson we should learn from this experience. We can't change the Iraqi people; they're going to be who they are, and it's time for us to accept that.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're making enough progress, and I believe it's time for us to leave. Once we do, the country will likely collapse, and we'll be no better off than we are now. We can't stay in Iraq forever, and I think we're causing more harm to ourselves than good by staying."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few areas. Their views on certain issues are not really in tune with the times, and that's one reason why they're losing followers. For instance, they have strong opinions on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, but these views seem a bit outdated. If the Church adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these issues, and that's causing them to lose faith. If you're pro-choice on abortion or support gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable following a Church that views these things as wrong. It's the same with other issues where the Church's views clash with your own. \n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's not like having a family life would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church. I mean, just because priests are married to God doesn't mean they can't have a life outside of their vocation. Everyone else has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?\n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to devote their entire lives to their work, with no personal life. I think it would be more realistic and healthy for them to have both a career and a family. It's not like they're asking for the world; they just want a bit of balance in their lives.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for who they are. It doesn't make sense to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a matter of choice; they're just born with their orientation. I'm not sure I've thought it through, but it does seem wrong to me that some people are denied the right to marry because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems that being gay isn't something people choose; it's just how they are. I was born straight, and people are born with different orientations, so it's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue; it's not a legal or moral issue, but rather a personal one. I don't think it's fair to judge or punish people for who they are.\n\nIt's hard for me to put into words, but I think the federal government should stay out of it. This isn't a matter of national security or morality; it's just a personal aspect of people's lives. They shouldn't have the right to interfere or judge people based on their sexual orientation. It's who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but that's just not the case. It's apples and oranges; they're two different things with different aspects.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin - heads and tails are never going to be the same, but they're still part of the same coin. Same-sex couples have the same basic rights as straight couples, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick, and they can't visit because they're not technically considered family. It's a pretty silly reason to deny someone's partner the right to be with them in a time of need.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as straight couples. At the end of the day, it's just a relationship - the same thing. Where people get hung up is on the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they're asking for a marriage certificate from the government. If you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as straight couples, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. The real issue is that some people are uncomfortable with the idea of same-sex relationships, and that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights.\n\nPeople worry about the impact on children, but that's a complex issue. Some people think that children of same-sex couples will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, but that's just not true. Children are influenced by their parents' values and parenting skills, not their orientation. And just like straight couples, gay couples can be good parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment against it should be repealed. President Bush has his own views on gay marriage, which are based on his religious beliefs, but that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights. The government should be more inclusive and not impose its own moral views on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not supported by research, and people should listen to experts, not just their opinions or cultural norms. If we listened to institutions that have actually studied these issues, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have some beneficial properties. I mean, as far as making it available to the public, I'm absolutely against it. I don't think that's a good idea. But, for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. If we dismiss something just because it's not allowed, that's not fair. There are plenty of controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, that we use all the time in the pharmacy because they're beneficial, even though they're not exactly legal. We shouldn't be denying the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it. I think we should be embracing its potential benefits.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol. I mean, if you overuse marijuana, it can have negative consequences, just like with alcohol. It's a tough issue. I think the key is to integrate it gradually, rather than making it legal all at once. If we did that, it might get abused, but if we can first remove the negative image associated with marijuana, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nYou see, people have this really bad perception of marijuana because it's an illicit substance. But, it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. I think if we can change the way people view marijuana, they might be more likely to use it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I've noticed this firsthand, especially when I attend church services. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday and dress up in matching outfits, including cute dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal, and I felt like it was a special occasion. However, as I've grown older, the church has started to adapt to the changing times. They've even introduced a 30-minute mass for teenagers, which has become more casual. People now wear jeans and khakis, even during morning masses, which was previously a time for more formal attire.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift in the overall atmosphere. The church I'm familiar with has become more relaxed, and it's not as formal as it used to be. I'm not aware of the church's politics, but I think this is a good thing.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who become pedophiles regardless of their marital status, and their attraction to young children is not something that can be altered by marriage or other external factors. I think it's a personal choice to become a priest, and if someone wants to be married while practicing their faith, they might consider a different denomination that allows it, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church. I don't think the church's stance on marriage or celibacy is the root cause of the problem.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is largely determined by genetics. People are born with certain inclinations, and it's not something that can be changed through upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some instances may be influenced by environmental factors, I believe that genetics play a significant role. Trying to hide or suppress these tendencies through marriage or other means is unlikely to be effective in the long run. If the church was aware of these situations and chose to cover them up, that's unacceptable, but I don't think they could have prevented the problem in the first place.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point, but I appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective on this sensitive issue.",
            "Honestly, I initially agreed with the premise, but I have to admit that the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was a really volatile time, and I think we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext to address some other issues that were already on the table. The Bush administration was quick to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false. That really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war has always been a sensitive topic for me.\n\nTo me, it seems like the Bush administration has been flagrantly lying to the American people, and they've yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented that infamous UN speech, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. It's like they're trying to get away with malfeasance in office, which I think is a serious offense that should be impeachable. They seem to have this disregard for the constitution and have been trying to undermine it since 9/11, at least.\n\nI think they came into office with a predetermined plan to go to war, and the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his dad's administration. He might have been hoping to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nWhile I think it's time to get out of Iraq, I'm aware that withdrawing now could lead to chaos and more deaths as the country teeters on the brink of civil war. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, might not be the best idea either, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create more problems in the long run.\n\nThe Iraqi government seems ineffective, and from what I've seen, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, especially with parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's holding sway. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.",
            "You know, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq, and I'm not sure where I stand on it. To be honest, it's all kind of confusing, but I guess my main feeling is that it's pointless, or at least it doesn't feel like it's going anywhere. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, so it's hard to really understand what's going on.\n\nI think it was kind of like a response to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being involved. But now, it feels like we're just stuck there trying to build democracy, which is a long-term goal, and it's hard to see how it's actually making things better. Plus, we're also interested in getting oil from them, which doesn't seem like a good reason to be there.\n\nThe thing is, if we leave, Iraq will be upset, but if we stay, it's going to take forever to build a stable democracy, and it's going to be hard to leave without messing things up even more. And if we keep trying to impose our values on them, it's going to create more problems, like more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida.\n\nIt's all really complicated, and I don't know what the best solution is. I guess I'm just worried that it's going to drag on for years and years, and it's not going to end well. That's pretty much my take on it.\n\nAs for calling it a war, I don't think that's even accurate. I mean, it wasn't declared by Congress, so it doesn't feel like a real war to me. And it's hard to justify staying there when it's causing so much suffering and destruction.\n\nBut at the same time, I know there are families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I feel for them. It's hard to know what to do, because I don't want to see anyone get hurt, but I also don't want us to be stuck in a situation that's not making things better.\n\nI guess that's my take on it. It's all just really complicated, and I don't know what the answer is.",
            "Honestly, I think it's unfair for a government to make laws based on religious beliefs. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle in the constitution, and it's clearly stated that the government should not interfere with church matters. I believe that trying to enforce laws based on one church's views would be a direct contradiction to this principle.\n\nIt seems to me that those pushing for a ban on a certain issue are essentially favoring one church over others. For example, most Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, but there are some exceptions. However, I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't allow.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for religious tolerance and freedom. Given that an amendment is being proposed, I think it's misguided and contradictory to the existing laws. It would be one of the few amendments intended to restrict individuals rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs, and it's unfair to impose his views on others. Every religion should have the freedom to make its own decisions, and it's up to the churches to decide what's right for them, not the government.\n\nI don't see any solid reason for the amendment, other than personal opinions. It's not clear how it would impact the economy or society in a positive way. In fact, it might even have a beneficial effect by promoting a more open and accepting society. I think I've said all I need to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq has left me with many unanswered questions. I think the US government may not have been entirely honest with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. They attempted to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks, which didn't necessarily have a direct connection. This emotional manipulation of the public's sentiment may have contributed to the invasion in 2003. As someone who's generally against going to war, especially preemptive strikes, I think the parallels between the Iraq war and the Vietnam War are striking. The US government seemed to disregard the lessons learned from past mistakes, resulting in a tremendous loss of American lives.\n\nThe invasion and removal of the Iraqi government were poorly planned, and the US didn't anticipate the chaos and power vacuum that would follow. They're now trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their attempts in Vietnam to oust Communists and install democracy. However, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process, not a quick, clear victory.\n\nIt's almost impossible to win against an entire nation's population when fighting insurgents, as opposed to a conventional army. I think the government underestimated the difficulty of this task and didn't prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. It's been almost a decade since the invasion, and we're still there, struggling to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to secure their own country. I believe the government has been naive in thinking this would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and arduous process, with many struggles and civil wars along the way. The US government made it seem like establishing democracy in Iraq would be relatively easy, which was a misleading message. It's a difficult decision to make, especially considering the long-term commitment required to establish a stable government.\n\nThe idea of abandoning Iraq now, after removing their government and disrupting their way of life, is a moral dilemma. We should try to see this through, but on the other hand, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify the risks involved. It seems to me that the real reason for invading Iraq was to control its oil resources, rather than to spread democracy. The lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a key factor in the decision to invade, yet countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, weren't targeted.\n\nI just hope the war in Iraq ends soon and that there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, it's unlikely to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and state my opinion on gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. To be honest, I always have been. I think it comes down to personal preference, and it's been proven that it's not just a matter of environment, but also biology. So, it's unfair to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI believe it's inhumane to do so, and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. In my opinion, the government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal decision that affects individuals and their families, not the state.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family would. They walk their dogs, interact with their neighbors, and go about their daily lives just like everyone else. It's not right that President Bush thinks he can interpret what marriage means and dictate it to everyone else.\n\nI think it's ridiculous when you consider that research has shown that there may be a biological component to being gay, rather than it being a product of environment or upbringing. It's not just about the number of siblings you have or the presence of a father figure - there are actual chemical factors at play.\n\nIf a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately without anyone's knowledge, but if a same-sex couple wants to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "I mean, seriously, when you post something online, it's a public platform. It's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. You put something out there, and it's going to influence how people perceive you. Talking about violent or disturbing topics can spark people's reactions, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, they'll see that bulletin. It's not the school that receives the bulletin; someone else shares it, and they have to take action. They can't just ignore it, or who knows, something bad might happen, and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's tough to know what's serious and what's just a joke. Take the incident we had on campus, for instance. It might have been a sociology experiment gone wrong or a genuine threat. Either way, when people heard about it, they were worried. When you share stuff online, there's no invasion of privacy; if you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. It's not like you can dictate how others perceive you.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media platforms or snoop through their profiles. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously. It's not the same as monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IMs. If a teacher creates a fake account to befriend students, that's crossing a line. I wouldn't do that as an R.A. because I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially if they're posting pictures of themselves having fun. That's not my concern, and I shouldn't have to deal with it.",
            "I feel that the war has been dragging on for too long. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble goal. However, it seems that we've lost sight of this purpose and are now just going through the motions to prove our strength as a superpower. I also wonder if the original motivation was tainted by George Bush's personal vendetta with Saddam Hussein, given his father's previous conflicts with him. If the war was meant to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that personal agendas were involved.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the first few months of the war, and that was a significant statement in itself. But continuing to fight for over a year or multiple years is just too prolonged. If our goal was to free a country from tyranny, that's a noble purpose, but I think our reasoning has been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting.\n\nI believe it's time for us to bring this war to an end. Our government officials should be able to fend for themselves by now. We're wasting billions of dollars on a war that's been dragging on for too long, while we have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare. It's time to redirect that money towards our own problems, rather than continuing to hemorrhage it in a foreign conflict that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe money being spent on war could be better used to fund essential public services, like education, healthcare, and public transportation. The fact that our citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost its way is unacceptable. I think that's the main issue here.",
            "I was wondering if you could clarify something for me. I was thinking about this situation where someone actually prevented a potentially bad situation from happening because they found out about it online. Apparently, it was because someone had discovered the information on a social media website like Myspace.\n\nOkay, so, I was thinking, if you post something online, it's pretty much public information, right? On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends with them, you're basically giving them permission to see your stuff. It's kind of like that when you put anything online, you're kind of open to everyone seeing it.\n\nI have to admit, I think it's actually good that someone was able to see that information and prevent something bad from happening. But, on the other hand, it's a tough situation because you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent bad things from happening. That would be like some kind of profiling, which isn't fair. But, at the same time, if someone is looking for information and they happen to stumble upon something that indicates someone is planning something bad, it's a different story.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's kind of weird to think about how much information is out there about you online, and how easily someone can access it. I've heard stories about people being able to find out all sorts of personal information about people online, which is pretty scary. For example, I saw a TV show about someone who was able to find out a girl's screen name and start talking to her on instant messenger, and she ended up meeting with him. It's crazy to think about how easily that can happen.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because, on the one hand, you want to be able to connect with your friends online, but on the other hand, you don't want to put yourself out there for everyone to see. I've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, that's kind of the point of having social media, right? It's a delicate balance.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she mentioned that her high school actually banned Myspace, which seemed weird to me. I'm not sure how they had the right to do that, and it's not really a privacy issue, but it's still kind of strange.\n\nThat's my take on it, I guess.",
            "I don't know how to start this but I guess I should mention the Iraq War one more time. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up, but I was against it from the start, and I'm not sure why it's not that important anymore. Everyone's just kind of accepted that it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who won't admit they were wrong. It's clear when you look at the polls - in the US, Iraq, and globally, around 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops think it was a dumb idea and we should leave within a year. I just think it's been a disaster from the start, and now it's hard to see how we can get out without causing another mess. \n\nIt's all about the huge cultural gap between the US and the Middle East. I don't think we can impose democracy on a place where it's not wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but we have to weigh the pros and cons before invading. It was clear that we'd just create a disaster, like quicksand. I don't really see a reason for us to stay anymore - I haven't heard any legitimate reasons from the administration that make sense to me. If they want to leave gradually, I'm okay with that, but I just don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, it's worth listening to their opinions. At least if we ask and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. It would be better if we were seen as trying to help, rather than just being there for our own reasons.",
            "You know, I really think there's still a lot of gender bias in the United States. I mean, it's not just a women's issue, but it's more prevalent in certain industries, like the ones we work in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where people have a hard time accepting that women can be in charge or have authority. It's just how society has been conditioned for so long. In the workplace, women often have the qualifications and skills, but they're not always promoted to the top positions because people are used to seeing men in those roles.\n\nIt's not just women, though, because men can face prejudice too, especially when it comes to things like stay-at-home parenting. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and raise their kids, like it's not what men are supposed to do. They should be the breadwinners, right? But sometimes that's not what works best for the family, and it can be really tough on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's a bit different, but there's still a problem. People might not take guys who are into fashion seriously, especially if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's like, if you're a guy who likes fashion, people might think you're not really understanding what women go through. They might not take your opinions seriously because you're not part of the \"typical\" male style.\n\nAnyway, I feel like gender bias is a big issue, and it's hard to change because people have a set way of thinking. We've come a long way, but it's still slow going. I think if we keep working at the pace we are now, with women getting more into leadership positions and being accepted in business, it'll happen eventually. People will start to realize that men can be stay-at-home dads too, and that guys can be into fashion and still be taken seriously.\n\nI guess the key is to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped, but not be pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now where people are starting to get it. We've made progress, and change takes time, so I'm not sure what more we can do at this point.\n\nOh, and it's not just men and women – people can be biased against each other depending on their background, education, and even where they're from. Like, if someone's not from a city, they might get looked down on because of their grammar or accent. It's a complex issue, but I think it's worth talking about.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. That means it got bumped down from a serious offense to more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested. I think this can be a good thing, as it reduces the harsh consequences people face from a marijuana charge, especially for jobs and other important stuff. However, it's worth noting that even if it's decriminalized, there are still potential long-term effects to worry about. On the other hand, some argue that it's costly to arrest and process people for marijuana possession, and that the money saved could be better spent on other important things. \n\nIn places with a more open-minded attitude, like Denver, it seems like decriminalization has worked out well, allowing them to free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. Of course, there are still valid concerns about marijuana being available everywhere, and some people worry about the impact on society and individual behavior. I'm not sure how I feel about full legalization, but I do think it's an issue with complex pros and cons. For example, if it were fully legalized, it might lead to more people smoking and driving, which would be a problem. Plus, some people are still uncomfortable with the idea of marijuana being out in the open. In my opinion, alcohol has more significant effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more profound impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, it's hard to make generalizations about substances because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. So, it's a tough issue to tackle.",
            "To be honest, I agree \nBecause \nQuite frankly, many things they do are steeped in tradition \nThings that have been done in a very specific way for a long time \nAnd \nIt's great to have roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe in regular church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel that the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the rules precisely \nAnd \nThey often don't accept people who aren't perfectly devout Catholics, nor those from other faiths \nFor instance \nMy parents were a Catholic and an Episcopalian, and they weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith \n\nWhich \nIsn't really \nAbout being tolerant of other beliefs \nWe've always been taught to \nLove others, a fundamental Catholic principle \nHowever, it seems hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while excluding others \nThat's a major issue with some Catholic doctrine and practice \nIt's outdated, but they continue to follow it anyway \n\nHonestly, I don't think that would necessarily make a difference \nPersonally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to marry \nBut \nI don't think that would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior \nIt's a different issue altogether \nSo, I'm not sure if that would be an issue \n\nTo be honest, people who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status \nChildren are different from spouses, so \nIf someone is inclined to harm children, they probably would do it regardless of whether they're married \nAllowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents, as they would likely happen anyway \n\nNo, I don't think so",
            "Alright, I don't know what I think about this one... I'm still trying to make up my mind. It's a really tricky topic, and I'm not sure if either side is entirely right or wrong. The thing is, separating church and state can be tough, and defining marriage is even harder. It's a whole can of worms, and it's hard to resolve it without offending anyone.\n\nThe thing is, what is marriage? Is it a sacrament, or is it just a civil union? If it's a sacrament, then the government shouldn't really care about it. I mean, people who are baptized get tax breaks and other benefits, so why not married people too? And if you're married, it's just a civil union, right? Two people coming together, living together, and sharing their lives.\n\nBut then there's gay marriage. It's just two people, right? They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else. If all the states can agree on this, then it should be a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Come on, that's just not necessary. It's not a big enough deal to warrant amending the constitution.\n\nIt's just a matter of defining what marriage is and letting people live their lives. It's not worth messing with the constitution over. So, to answer your question, I don't have a clear stance on this one yet. I need some more time to think about it.",
            "Alright, I'll be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and when it comes to homosexuality, it's a bit of a complicated issue for me. On one hand, I have many gay friends and I care about them deeply, but on the other hand, I'm not entirely in agreement with the lifestyle. However, I strongly believe that it should be legalized and not made a national issue. Instead, I think it should be up to each individual state to decide for themselves. \n\nI mean, we have democratic and republican states, and it's only natural that democratic states would be more open to gay marriage. If you live in a state that leans one way or the other, I think you should respect the decision of that state. After all, you chose to live there, so it's only fair that you accept the values and laws that come with it. I believe that everyone, regardless of orientation, deserves equal opportunities, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage. \n\nAs for the current president's stance on the issue, I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't have the power to dictate how each one runs itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, and this is one of them. Plus, his term is limited, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's the states that'll have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I think this is a matter that should be left to the states, not the federal government.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor what students post online. I mean, Myspace is a public platform, after all. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that others, including school officials, might see it. Even if you're not posting under the school's name, there's nothing stopping them from accessing it from their own homes. With school safety being a top priority, I think it's reasonable for officials to keep an eye out for content that might indicate students are engaging in risky behavior, like underage drinking or smoking. \n\nNow, I'm not saying it's cool for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students and get them in trouble. But if they're using online monitoring as a tool to prevent harm and keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's kind of like when parents drop off their kids at school and expect it to be a safe environment - they want to know that the school is taking steps to prevent problems like bullying or violence. I've discussed this with a teacher before, and they told me that schools have to take proactive measures to ensure student safety, like lockdown drills and emergency preparedness. It's all about making the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nI know some people might see this as an invasion of privacy, but I don't think it's unreasonable for schools to be vigilant about student safety. After all, everything you post online can come back to haunt you, and I'd rather err on the side of caution. I mean, think about it - if you do something questionable as a college student, it can come back to bite you years later when you're a successful person. \n\nSo yeah, I think it's a public thing, and if school officials are using online monitoring to keep students safe, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Of course, it's not about going on the internet just to catch students - it's about using any available tools to prevent harm and make the school a better place. That's basically my take on it.",
            "Honestly, I've had a change of heart about the war. At first, I supported it because I was deeply affected by the events of 9/11 and wanted to see the perpetrators brought to justice. I was so caught up in my emotions that I didn't think through the long-term consequences. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, and I think that was a huge mistake. It's clear that our actions backfired, and I'm now strongly against the war.\n\nIn my opinion, the people we're fighting don't care about us as long as they're fighting among themselves. It's pointless for us to be over there, trying to impose our will on them when they can't even get along with each other. Our presence in their country has only caused more problems, and I've come to realize that I just don't care what happens over there.\n\nI sometimes wonder if they're even capable of being human, given their brutal approach to war. It seems like they're more interested in driving us out than in improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them sort out their own issues.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war in a state of emotional frenzy, driven by a desire for revenge. We weren't thinking clearly about the potential consequences or how the Iraqis would react to our presence. We were more focused on seeking payback than on creating a better future for them.\n\nIn retrospect, I think President Bush should have had a clearer plan and a more rational approach. We couldn't just ignore the threat posed by Iraq and expect everything to go back to normal. However, I believe we could have achieved more if we had a better strategy and a stronger understanding of what we were trying to accomplish.\n\nThe lack of unity and clear goals on our part only made things worse, and I think that's a crucial lesson we should learn from this experience. We can't change the Iraqi people; they're going to be who they are, and it's time for us to accept that.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're making enough progress, and I believe it's time for us to leave. Once we do, the country will likely collapse, and we'll be no better off than we are now. We can't stay in Iraq forever, and I think we're causing more harm to ourselves than good by staying."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few areas. Their views on certain issues are not really in tune with the times, and that's one reason why they're losing followers. For instance, they have strong opinions on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, but these views seem a bit outdated. If the Church adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these issues, and that's causing them to lose faith. If you're pro-choice on abortion or support gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable following a Church that views these things as wrong. It's the same with other issues where the Church's views clash with your own. \n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's not like having a family life would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church. I mean, just because priests are married to God doesn't mean they can't have a life outside of their vocation. Everyone else has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?\n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to devote their entire lives to their work, with no personal life. I think it would be more realistic and healthy for them to have both a career and a family. It's not like they're asking for the world; they just want a bit of balance in their lives.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for who they are. It doesn't make sense to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a matter of choice; they're just born with their orientation. I'm not sure I've thought it through, but it does seem wrong to me that some people are denied the right to marry because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems that being gay isn't something people choose; it's just how they are. I was born straight, and people are born with different orientations, so it's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue; it's not a legal or moral issue, but rather a personal one. I don't think it's fair to judge or punish people for who they are.\n\nIt's hard for me to put into words, but I think the federal government should stay out of it. This isn't a matter of national security or morality; it's just a personal aspect of people's lives. They shouldn't have the right to interfere or judge people based on their sexual orientation. It's who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but that's just not the case. It's apples and oranges; they're two different things with different aspects.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin - heads and tails are never going to be the same, but they're still part of the same coin. Same-sex couples have the same basic rights as straight couples, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick, and they can't visit because they're not technically considered family. It's a pretty silly reason to deny someone's partner the right to be with them in a time of need.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as straight couples. At the end of the day, it's just a relationship - the same thing. Where people get hung up is on the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they're asking for a marriage certificate from the government. If you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as straight couples, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. The real issue is that some people are uncomfortable with the idea of same-sex relationships, and that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights.\n\nPeople worry about the impact on children, but that's a complex issue. Some people think that children of same-sex couples will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, but that's just not true. Children are influenced by their parents' values and parenting skills, not their orientation. And just like straight couples, gay couples can be good parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment against it should be repealed. President Bush has his own views on gay marriage, which are based on his religious beliefs, but that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights. The government should be more inclusive and not impose its own moral views on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not supported by research, and people should listen to experts, not just their opinions or cultural norms. If we listened to institutions that have actually studied these issues, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have some beneficial properties. I mean, as far as making it available to the public, I'm absolutely against it. I don't think that's a good idea. But, for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. If we dismiss something just because it's not allowed, that's not fair. There are plenty of controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, that we use all the time in the pharmacy because they're beneficial, even though they're not exactly legal. We shouldn't be denying the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it. I think we should be embracing its potential benefits.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol. I mean, if you overuse marijuana, it can have negative consequences, just like with alcohol. It's a tough issue. I think the key is to integrate it gradually, rather than making it legal all at once. If we did that, it might get abused, but if we can first remove the negative image associated with marijuana, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nYou see, people have this really bad perception of marijuana because it's an illicit substance. But, it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. I think if we can change the way people view marijuana, they might be more likely to use it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I've noticed this firsthand, especially when I attend church services. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday and dress up in matching outfits, including cute dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal, and I felt like it was a special occasion. However, as I've grown older, the church has started to adapt to the changing times. They've even introduced a 30-minute mass for teenagers, which has become more casual. People now wear jeans and khakis, even during morning masses, which was previously a time for more formal attire.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift in the overall atmosphere. The church I'm familiar with has become more relaxed, and it's not as formal as it used to be. I'm not aware of the church's politics, but I think this is a good thing.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who become pedophiles regardless of their marital status, and their attraction to young children is not something that can be altered by marriage or other external factors. I think it's a personal choice to become a priest, and if someone wants to be married while practicing their faith, they might consider a different denomination that allows it, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church. I don't think the church's stance on marriage or celibacy is the root cause of the problem.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is largely determined by genetics. People are born with certain inclinations, and it's not something that can be changed through upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some instances may be influenced by environmental factors, I believe that genetics play a significant role. Trying to hide or suppress these tendencies through marriage or other means is unlikely to be effective in the long run. If the church was aware of these situations and chose to cover them up, that's unacceptable, but I don't think they could have prevented the problem in the first place.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point, but I appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective on this sensitive issue.",
            "Honestly, I initially agreed with the premise, but I have to admit that the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was a really volatile time, and I think we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext to address some other issues that were already on the table. The Bush administration was quick to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false. That really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war has always been a sensitive topic for me.\n\nTo me, it seems like the Bush administration has been flagrantly lying to the American people, and they've yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented that infamous UN speech, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. It's like they're trying to get away with malfeasance in office, which I think is a serious offense that should be impeachable. They seem to have this disregard for the constitution and have been trying to undermine it since 9/11, at least.\n\nI think they came into office with a predetermined plan to go to war, and the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his dad's administration. He might have been hoping to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nWhile I think it's time to get out of Iraq, I'm aware that withdrawing now could lead to chaos and more deaths as the country teeters on the brink of civil war. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, might not be the best idea either, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create more problems in the long run.\n\nThe Iraqi government seems ineffective, and from what I've seen, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, especially with parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's holding sway. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.",
            "You know, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq, and I'm not sure where I stand on it. To be honest, it's all kind of confusing, but I guess my main feeling is that it's pointless, or at least it doesn't feel like it's going anywhere. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, so it's hard to really understand what's going on.\n\nI think it was kind of like a response to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being involved. But now, it feels like we're just stuck there trying to build democracy, which is a long-term goal, and it's hard to see how it's actually making things better. Plus, we're also interested in getting oil from them, which doesn't seem like a good reason to be there.\n\nThe thing is, if we leave, Iraq will be upset, but if we stay, it's going to take forever to build a stable democracy, and it's going to be hard to leave without messing things up even more. And if we keep trying to impose our values on them, it's going to create more problems, like more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida.\n\nIt's all really complicated, and I don't know what the best solution is. I guess I'm just worried that it's going to drag on for years and years, and it's not going to end well. That's pretty much my take on it.\n\nAs for calling it a war, I don't think that's even accurate. I mean, it wasn't declared by Congress, so it doesn't feel like a real war to me. And it's hard to justify staying there when it's causing so much suffering and destruction.\n\nBut at the same time, I know there are families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I feel for them. It's hard to know what to do, because I don't want to see anyone get hurt, but I also don't want us to be stuck in a situation that's not making things better.\n\nI guess that's my take on it. It's all just really complicated, and I don't know what the answer is.",
            "Honestly, I think it's unfair for a government to make laws based on religious beliefs. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle in the constitution, and it's clearly stated that the government should not interfere with church matters. I believe that trying to enforce laws based on one church's views would be a direct contradiction to this principle.\n\nIt seems to me that those pushing for a ban on a certain issue are essentially favoring one church over others. For example, most Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, but there are some exceptions. However, I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't allow.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for religious tolerance and freedom. Given that an amendment is being proposed, I think it's misguided and contradictory to the existing laws. It would be one of the few amendments intended to restrict individuals rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs, and it's unfair to impose his views on others. Every religion should have the freedom to make its own decisions, and it's up to the churches to decide what's right for them, not the government.\n\nI don't see any solid reason for the amendment, other than personal opinions. It's not clear how it would impact the economy or society in a positive way. In fact, it might even have a beneficial effect by promoting a more open and accepting society. I think I've said all I need to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq has left me with many unanswered questions. I think the US government may not have been entirely honest with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. They attempted to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks, which didn't necessarily have a direct connection. This emotional manipulation of the public's sentiment may have contributed to the invasion in 2003. As someone who's generally against going to war, especially preemptive strikes, I think the parallels between the Iraq war and the Vietnam War are striking. The US government seemed to disregard the lessons learned from past mistakes, resulting in a tremendous loss of American lives.\n\nThe invasion and removal of the Iraqi government were poorly planned, and the US didn't anticipate the chaos and power vacuum that would follow. They're now trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their attempts in Vietnam to oust Communists and install democracy. However, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process, not a quick, clear victory.\n\nIt's almost impossible to win against an entire nation's population when fighting insurgents, as opposed to a conventional army. I think the government underestimated the difficulty of this task and didn't prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. It's been almost a decade since the invasion, and we're still there, struggling to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to secure their own country. I believe the government has been naive in thinking this would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and arduous process, with many struggles and civil wars along the way. The US government made it seem like establishing democracy in Iraq would be relatively easy, which was a misleading message. It's a difficult decision to make, especially considering the long-term commitment required to establish a stable government.\n\nThe idea of abandoning Iraq now, after removing their government and disrupting their way of life, is a moral dilemma. We should try to see this through, but on the other hand, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify the risks involved. It seems to me that the real reason for invading Iraq was to control its oil resources, rather than to spread democracy. The lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a key factor in the decision to invade, yet countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, weren't targeted.\n\nI just hope the war in Iraq ends soon and that there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, it's unlikely to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and state my opinion on gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. To be honest, I always have been. I think it comes down to personal preference, and it's been proven that it's not just a matter of environment, but also biology. So, it's unfair to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI believe it's inhumane to do so, and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. In my opinion, the government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal decision that affects individuals and their families, not the state.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family would. They walk their dogs, interact with their neighbors, and go about their daily lives just like everyone else. It's not right that President Bush thinks he can interpret what marriage means and dictate it to everyone else.\n\nI think it's ridiculous when you consider that research has shown that there may be a biological component to being gay, rather than it being a product of environment or upbringing. It's not just about the number of siblings you have or the presence of a father figure - there are actual chemical factors at play.\n\nIf a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately without anyone's knowledge, but if a same-sex couple wants to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "I mean, seriously, when you post something online, it's a public platform. It's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. You put something out there, and it's going to influence how people perceive you. Talking about violent or disturbing topics can spark people's reactions, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, they'll see that bulletin. It's not the school that receives the bulletin; someone else shares it, and they have to take action. They can't just ignore it, or who knows, something bad might happen, and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's tough to know what's serious and what's just a joke. Take the incident we had on campus, for instance. It might have been a sociology experiment gone wrong or a genuine threat. Either way, when people heard about it, they were worried. When you share stuff online, there's no invasion of privacy; if you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. It's not like you can dictate how others perceive you.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media platforms or snoop through their profiles. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously. It's not the same as monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IMs. If a teacher creates a fake account to befriend students, that's crossing a line. I wouldn't do that as an R.A. because I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially if they're posting pictures of themselves having fun. That's not my concern, and I shouldn't have to deal with it.",
            "I feel that the war has been dragging on for too long. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble goal. However, it seems that we've lost sight of this purpose and are now just going through the motions to prove our strength as a superpower. I also wonder if the original motivation was tainted by George Bush's personal vendetta with Saddam Hussein, given his father's previous conflicts with him. If the war was meant to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that personal agendas were involved.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the first few months of the war, and that was a significant statement in itself. But continuing to fight for over a year or multiple years is just too prolonged. If our goal was to free a country from tyranny, that's a noble purpose, but I think our reasoning has been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting.\n\nI believe it's time for us to bring this war to an end. Our government officials should be able to fend for themselves by now. We're wasting billions of dollars on a war that's been dragging on for too long, while we have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare. It's time to redirect that money towards our own problems, rather than continuing to hemorrhage it in a foreign conflict that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe money being spent on war could be better used to fund essential public services, like education, healthcare, and public transportation. The fact that our citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost its way is unacceptable. I think that's the main issue here.",
            "I was wondering if you could clarify something for me. I was thinking about this situation where someone actually prevented a potentially bad situation from happening because they found out about it online. Apparently, it was because someone had discovered the information on a social media website like Myspace.\n\nOkay, so, I was thinking, if you post something online, it's pretty much public information, right? On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends with them, you're basically giving them permission to see your stuff. It's kind of like that when you put anything online, you're kind of open to everyone seeing it.\n\nI have to admit, I think it's actually good that someone was able to see that information and prevent something bad from happening. But, on the other hand, it's a tough situation because you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent bad things from happening. That would be like some kind of profiling, which isn't fair. But, at the same time, if someone is looking for information and they happen to stumble upon something that indicates someone is planning something bad, it's a different story.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's kind of weird to think about how much information is out there about you online, and how easily someone can access it. I've heard stories about people being able to find out all sorts of personal information about people online, which is pretty scary. For example, I saw a TV show about someone who was able to find out a girl's screen name and start talking to her on instant messenger, and she ended up meeting with him. It's crazy to think about how easily that can happen.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because, on the one hand, you want to be able to connect with your friends online, but on the other hand, you don't want to put yourself out there for everyone to see. I've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, that's kind of the point of having social media, right? It's a delicate balance.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she mentioned that her high school actually banned Myspace, which seemed weird to me. I'm not sure how they had the right to do that, and it's not really a privacy issue, but it's still kind of strange.\n\nThat's my take on it, I guess.",
            "I don't know how to start this but I guess I should mention the Iraq War one more time. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up, but I was against it from the start, and I'm not sure why it's not that important anymore. Everyone's just kind of accepted that it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who won't admit they were wrong. It's clear when you look at the polls - in the US, Iraq, and globally, around 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops think it was a dumb idea and we should leave within a year. I just think it's been a disaster from the start, and now it's hard to see how we can get out without causing another mess. \n\nIt's all about the huge cultural gap between the US and the Middle East. I don't think we can impose democracy on a place where it's not wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but we have to weigh the pros and cons before invading. It was clear that we'd just create a disaster, like quicksand. I don't really see a reason for us to stay anymore - I haven't heard any legitimate reasons from the administration that make sense to me. If they want to leave gradually, I'm okay with that, but I just don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, it's worth listening to their opinions. At least if we ask and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. It would be better if we were seen as trying to help, rather than just being there for our own reasons.",
            "You know, I really think there's still a lot of gender bias in the United States. I mean, it's not just a women's issue, but it's more prevalent in certain industries, like the ones we work in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where people have a hard time accepting that women can be in charge or have authority. It's just how society has been conditioned for so long. In the workplace, women often have the qualifications and skills, but they're not always promoted to the top positions because people are used to seeing men in those roles.\n\nIt's not just women, though, because men can face prejudice too, especially when it comes to things like stay-at-home parenting. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and raise their kids, like it's not what men are supposed to do. They should be the breadwinners, right? But sometimes that's not what works best for the family, and it can be really tough on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's a bit different, but there's still a problem. People might not take guys who are into fashion seriously, especially if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's like, if you're a guy who likes fashion, people might think you're not really understanding what women go through. They might not take your opinions seriously because you're not part of the \"typical\" male style.\n\nAnyway, I feel like gender bias is a big issue, and it's hard to change because people have a set way of thinking. We've come a long way, but it's still slow going. I think if we keep working at the pace we are now, with women getting more into leadership positions and being accepted in business, it'll happen eventually. People will start to realize that men can be stay-at-home dads too, and that guys can be into fashion and still be taken seriously.\n\nI guess the key is to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped, but not be pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now where people are starting to get it. We've made progress, and change takes time, so I'm not sure what more we can do at this point.\n\nOh, and it's not just men and women – people can be biased against each other depending on their background, education, and even where they're from. Like, if someone's not from a city, they might get looked down on because of their grammar or accent. It's a complex issue, but I think it's worth talking about.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. That means it got bumped down from a serious offense to more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested. I think this can be a good thing, as it reduces the harsh consequences people face from a marijuana charge, especially for jobs and other important stuff. However, it's worth noting that even if it's decriminalized, there are still potential long-term effects to worry about. On the other hand, some argue that it's costly to arrest and process people for marijuana possession, and that the money saved could be better spent on other important things. \n\nIn places with a more open-minded attitude, like Denver, it seems like decriminalization has worked out well, allowing them to free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. Of course, there are still valid concerns about marijuana being available everywhere, and some people worry about the impact on society and individual behavior. I'm not sure how I feel about full legalization, but I do think it's an issue with complex pros and cons. For example, if it were fully legalized, it might lead to more people smoking and driving, which would be a problem. Plus, some people are still uncomfortable with the idea of marijuana being out in the open. In my opinion, alcohol has more significant effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more profound impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, it's hard to make generalizations about substances because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. So, it's a tough issue to tackle.",
            "To be honest, I agree \nBecause \nQuite frankly, many things they do are steeped in tradition \nThings that have been done in a very specific way for a long time \nAnd \nIt's great to have roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe in regular church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel that the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the rules precisely \nAnd \nThey often don't accept people who aren't perfectly devout Catholics, nor those from other faiths \nFor instance \nMy parents were a Catholic and an Episcopalian, and they weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith \n\nWhich \nIsn't really \nAbout being tolerant of other beliefs \nWe've always been taught to \nLove others, a fundamental Catholic principle \nHowever, it seems hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while excluding others \nThat's a major issue with some Catholic doctrine and practice \nIt's outdated, but they continue to follow it anyway \n\nHonestly, I don't think that would necessarily make a difference \nPersonally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to marry \nBut \nI don't think that would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior \nIt's a different issue altogether \nSo, I'm not sure if that would be an issue \n\nTo be honest, people who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status \nChildren are different from spouses, so \nIf someone is inclined to harm children, they probably would do it regardless of whether they're married \nAllowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents, as they would likely happen anyway \n\nNo, I don't think so",
            "Alright, I don't know what I think about this one... I'm still trying to make up my mind. It's a really tricky topic, and I'm not sure if either side is entirely right or wrong. The thing is, separating church and state can be tough, and defining marriage is even harder. It's a whole can of worms, and it's hard to resolve it without offending anyone.\n\nThe thing is, what is marriage? Is it a sacrament, or is it just a civil union? If it's a sacrament, then the government shouldn't really care about it. I mean, people who are baptized get tax breaks and other benefits, so why not married people too? And if you're married, it's just a civil union, right? Two people coming together, living together, and sharing their lives.\n\nBut then there's gay marriage. It's just two people, right? They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else. If all the states can agree on this, then it should be a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Come on, that's just not necessary. It's not a big enough deal to warrant amending the constitution.\n\nIt's just a matter of defining what marriage is and letting people live their lives. It's not worth messing with the constitution over. So, to answer your question, I don't have a clear stance on this one yet. I need some more time to think about it.",
            "Alright, I'll be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and when it comes to homosexuality, it's a bit of a complicated issue for me. On one hand, I have many gay friends and I care about them deeply, but on the other hand, I'm not entirely in agreement with the lifestyle. However, I strongly believe that it should be legalized and not made a national issue. Instead, I think it should be up to each individual state to decide for themselves. \n\nI mean, we have democratic and republican states, and it's only natural that democratic states would be more open to gay marriage. If you live in a state that leans one way or the other, I think you should respect the decision of that state. After all, you chose to live there, so it's only fair that you accept the values and laws that come with it. I believe that everyone, regardless of orientation, deserves equal opportunities, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage. \n\nAs for the current president's stance on the issue, I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't have the power to dictate how each one runs itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, and this is one of them. Plus, his term is limited, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's the states that'll have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I think this is a matter that should be left to the states, not the federal government.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor what students post online. I mean, Myspace is a public platform, after all. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that others, including school officials, might see it. Even if you're not posting under the school's name, there's nothing stopping them from accessing it from their own homes. With school safety being a top priority, I think it's reasonable for officials to keep an eye out for content that might indicate students are engaging in risky behavior, like underage drinking or smoking. \n\nNow, I'm not saying it's cool for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students and get them in trouble. But if they're using online monitoring as a tool to prevent harm and keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's kind of like when parents drop off their kids at school and expect it to be a safe environment - they want to know that the school is taking steps to prevent problems like bullying or violence. I've discussed this with a teacher before, and they told me that schools have to take proactive measures to ensure student safety, like lockdown drills and emergency preparedness. It's all about making the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nI know some people might see this as an invasion of privacy, but I don't think it's unreasonable for schools to be vigilant about student safety. After all, everything you post online can come back to haunt you, and I'd rather err on the side of caution. I mean, think about it - if you do something questionable as a college student, it can come back to bite you years later when you're a successful person. \n\nSo yeah, I think it's a public thing, and if school officials are using online monitoring to keep students safe, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Of course, it's not about going on the internet just to catch students - it's about using any available tools to prevent harm and make the school a better place. That's basically my take on it.",
            "Honestly, I've had a change of heart about the war. At first, I supported it because I was deeply affected by the events of 9/11 and wanted to see the perpetrators brought to justice. I was so caught up in my emotions that I didn't think through the long-term consequences. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, and I think that was a huge mistake. It's clear that our actions backfired, and I'm now strongly against the war.\n\nIn my opinion, the people we're fighting don't care about us as long as they're fighting among themselves. It's pointless for us to be over there, trying to impose our will on them when they can't even get along with each other. Our presence in their country has only caused more problems, and I've come to realize that I just don't care what happens over there.\n\nI sometimes wonder if they're even capable of being human, given their brutal approach to war. It seems like they're more interested in driving us out than in improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them sort out their own issues.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war in a state of emotional frenzy, driven by a desire for revenge. We weren't thinking clearly about the potential consequences or how the Iraqis would react to our presence. We were more focused on seeking payback than on creating a better future for them.\n\nIn retrospect, I think President Bush should have had a clearer plan and a more rational approach. We couldn't just ignore the threat posed by Iraq and expect everything to go back to normal. However, I believe we could have achieved more if we had a better strategy and a stronger understanding of what we were trying to accomplish.\n\nThe lack of unity and clear goals on our part only made things worse, and I think that's a crucial lesson we should learn from this experience. We can't change the Iraqi people; they're going to be who they are, and it's time for us to accept that.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're making enough progress, and I believe it's time for us to leave. Once we do, the country will likely collapse, and we'll be no better off than we are now. We can't stay in Iraq forever, and I think we're causing more harm to ourselves than good by staying."
