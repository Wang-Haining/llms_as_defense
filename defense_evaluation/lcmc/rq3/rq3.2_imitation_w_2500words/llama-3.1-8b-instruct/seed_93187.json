            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to evolve and adapt to the changing times. One reason for the decline in its following might be its rather restrictive and outdated views on various subjects. Take, for instance, the Church's stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control – these are issues where the Church's views seem to be stuck in the past. If they could update their perspective and become more accepting of modern ideas, they might not be losing followers.\n\nI've noticed that many people are increasingly alienated from the Church due to its rigid stance on these matters. Those who don't agree with the Church's views on, say, abortion, might find it challenging to be part of a community that actively discourages it. Similarly, individuals who support gay marriage or have similar views might feel unwelcome in a Church that doesn't condone it.\n\nI also think it's time for the Church to reconsider its stance on female priests and married priests. I don't see why priests can't be married or why women can't serve as priests. After all, the Church sees priests as being devoted to a higher authority, but I believe that's no reason to deny them a personal life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family, so why should priests be any different? It's time for the Church to modernize and become more inclusive.",
            "Honestly, I never thought I'd take a strong stance on gay marriage, but I have to admit that I'm not opposed to it. To me, people are either born gay or it's just part of who they are, and it's not something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them accountable for their sexual orientation. In my opinion, it's wrong to say that a man and woman can get married, but a same-sex couple can't. I mean, why should people be judged for who they are? It's not a topic I've given a lot of thought to, but it's clear to me that it's not right to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's worth considering that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can control. Like, I was born straight, and I'm pretty sure people are born gay too. It's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the government should be involved in something like this, as it's not really a legal or moral issue – it's just a matter of people being who they are. I don't think they should be judged or stigmatized for it. The government should just leave people alone and let them live their lives.\n\nIt's hard to understand why the government feels it's necessary to interfere in people's personal lives like this. It's not like it affects national security or anything. They just seem to be overstepping their bounds and imposing their opinions on people who don't really need it. To me, it's about accepting people for who they are and not trying to change them or punish them for being different. That's just not right.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm of the opinion that gay marriage should be legalized. There's not really a solid reason why it shouldn't be. Some people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's a misconception. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're two different things.\n\nThere are many aspects to consider, and it's hard to draw parallels between the two. It's like two sides of the same coin – you can't have one without the other. Civil rights come into play, such as property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit your partner in the hospital. It seems unfair that these rights aren't extended to same-sex couples.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples. It's all about the relationship itself, not the orientation of the individuals involved. The problem lies in the fact that people are getting hung up on the idea of church and state. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nIf we separate church and state, then it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation – separate but unequal. In a legal sense, if you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage? The main points of contention seem to be adoption issues, community concerns, and the potential impact on children raised by gay parents.\n\nSome people worry about how children will adjust to societal norms and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. However, it's hard to say for certain, especially when it comes to adoption. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In places like New York City, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and exclusion in public schools.\n\nUltimately, parenting skills are the same regardless of orientation. It comes down to individual personality choices, not the couple's makeup. I think the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal across the board. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage seem to be rooted in his personal moral code, which is influenced by his religion. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its moral views on the rest of the country, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and the separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has debunked this notion. Instead of listening to popular opinion or personal biases, we should rely on research and studies to inform our views on this issue.",
            "You know, I work at the hospital pharmacy and I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. I mean, it's pretty clear that if it's available for the public, I don't think it's a good idea. No way, not at all. But if we're talking about using it for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, even if something is illegal, it doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's a pretty simple idea, but some people just don't get it.\n\nFor example, there are loads of controlled substances that we use in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're basically off-limits to the public, but we use them all the time because they're actually pretty useful. And if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it, that doesn't make any sense to me. I think we should just accept its potential benefits and not be so judgmental.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think marijuana is that similar to alcohol, even though abusing either one can have negative consequences. But if we're talking about making it legal, I'd say it's better to do it gradually, not all at once. If we just remove the taboo around marijuana and people start to use it responsibly, that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really negative image of marijuana because it's seen as an illicit substance. But the truth is, it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. And if we can change that perception, maybe people will start to use it more sensibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern era. They're no longer as strict as they used to be. I can compare this to my own experiences growing up - I used to attend church every Sunday and get dressed up in matching outfits, but now they've introduced a more casual teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress down, even at the morning masses, and it's not uncommon to see families rushing in late or wearing beachwear. I think this shift towards casualness is a big change.\n\nTo be honest, that's the most noticeable thing to me about the church I'm familiar with. I'm not sure about the church's internal politics, but that's pretty much it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind lately is the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think these issues would have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Some men who are married still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not necessarily about their marital status. It's about the individual's character. I also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone wants to practice their faith while being married, they might consider a different religion. For example, some denominations allow their clergy to be married.\n\nIn my opinion, it's the individual's genetics that determine their sexuality, not their upbringing. I don't think people just develop these tendencies; they're born with them. You can't hide that through a marriage, and it's likely to come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done much to prevent these issues from happening. If they did know about it and tried to cover it up, that's a different story altogether, but I don't think that was always the case.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have anything to add.",
            "I mean, I was initially okay with the idea of the war, but I strongly felt that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and that we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext, with a bunch of pretexts leading us there. \n\nI think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which we later found out was all a lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. \n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who made that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. It's clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. \n\nIt's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he was also hoping to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nI think the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now would probably lead to chaos and more deaths, as the country could slide into civil war. The alternative being considered now is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either, as it would raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and could lead to more problems in the long run. \n\nThe interim government is failing, and the Parliament isn't effective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the political process. Even the anti-American cleric, Muktada al-Sadr, has a significant presence in the Parliament now, and there are still radical elements vying for control of the government, causing a lot of friction in the political process. \n\nHonestly, I don't have a solution that I can articulate without offending anyone.",
            "I'm thinking about the War in Iraq, and it's not easy to form a clear opinion. I mean, it's not even considered a declared war. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, kind of like in the US, and also to gain access to their oil resources. But the problem is, it's causing a lot of tension and upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to try to build democracy, which is a long-term process that can't be rushed. And if we leave, the Iraqis might be angry that we messed things up and they'll have to start from scratch. This whole situation is really complicated.\n\nI think the war is hard to wrap my head around, and I'm not sure what to say. I don't really know much about it. Do you have any other topics we can discuss?\n\nBut, if I'm being honest, I think the war should continue, but only because people are being forced to fight. I don't think we should call it a war anymore, though. I think it's more about showing off our military strength and power. It never should have been called a war in the first place, since it was never officially declared by Congress. You have to declare a war through Congress to make it official.\n\nI think we should be helping Iraq, but it's also a waste of our resources. And especially now, with Bush being president, it's making him look really bad. He's getting a bad reputation because of the war's impact and the way it's affecting people. Remember the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless conflict. I don't want Bush to be known as the president who started another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to be safe, but at the same time, I don't think we should be trying to mold them into a second US, which would only make things worse. The culture is so different, and I'm worried that our attempts to change them will only fuel more hatred towards the US. The Al-Qaeda situation will probably get worse, and we'll be stuck in a never-ending conflict.\n\nI think this whole situation will drag on for years to come. That's my take on it, I guess.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with making it a law or even letting the government decide it's legal. I think it's something that should be up to the churches, considering what the constitution says about separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that this is something that's already been stated and established. Trying to exert any kind of control over it would be a pretty big defiance of the constitution's principles.\n\nI think the people pushing to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what's allowed or not for the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, and it's what allows for religious tolerance in the US. I think trying to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government, which I don't think is right at all.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, and it's basically showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the government, and there's no real reason to back it up other than personal views.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see how it would have a major impact on the economy or anything else. If anything, it might even have a positive impact on society. I'm not sure how, but I think it could be a good thing.\n\nI've pretty much said it all, so I'm not sure I have much more to add.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely truthful about the reasons for going to war before invading the country. I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it wasn't as directly related as they made it out to be. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using the outrage from the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war.\n\nI personally oppose war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would occur.\n\nThey're trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted to do in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult process, and not a clear-cut victory. It's hard to fight an insurgency when you're fighting against the citizens of the country, not a traditional army.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes and been more prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. They weren't, and now we're still in Iraq, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. We're still training the Iraqi troops and police to take control of their own country, which is a long process.\n\nI believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn't be so naive about the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful. Democracy was a long struggle in our own country, and it's not an easy thing to achieve.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you consider the number of American casualties and the cost of continuing the war. I think we should try to see it through, but it's also important to consider the human cost and the question of whether it's worth it.\n\nOne of my concerns is that the war in Iraq is partly about oil and controlling resources. We invaded Iraq supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but we're not doing the same thing in other countries with similar issues. I think the US government isn't being entirely truthful about their motives and decisions.\n\nLet's hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon.",
            "I mean, I'm for gay marriage, and I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been shown to be biological rather than a result of societal influences. I think it's unfair to deprive people of rights due to something they can't control, which is their sexual orientation. It's almost inhumane, and I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this, it's a personal, household-level issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily business, and it's no different from any other family.\n\nI think it's ridiculous that Bush is trying to impose his interpretation of marriage on everyone else. It's clear that there's a biological component to being gay, and it's not something people choose. Research suggests that there's a chemical aspect to it, something people are predisposed to, rather than a result of their upbringing or environment.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's publicly scrutinized. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without drawing attention to themselves, but if a same-sex couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a major news event. It's just not right.",
            "Uh, I mean, when you post something online, it becomes public knowledge. It's completely out there, and you can't take it back. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. Once you share something online, it can shape people's perceptions of you, and that's a fact.\n\nIf you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably respond, and it can get out of hand. The internet is a public forum, and if you're connected to that person on social media, you'll likely see their messages. It's not the school that receives the message; it's someone who's seen it and decides to report it.\n\nSchool administrators have to act on it because they can't just ignore it, or they might miss an opportunity to prevent something serious from happening. It's a tough call, because you don't always know what to take seriously – it could be a joke or a serious threat.\n\nIn a recent situation, someone overheard a friend talking about something, and when we looked into it, we found some concerning posts on their social media account. It's a bit of a double-edged sword: you can't control what people think, and you can't dictate what they take seriously. If you don't want something shared, don't put it online.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media or snoop through their accounts. If something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously, but that's different from monitoring personal conversations or messages. It's a fine line to walk.\n\nI think it's a good idea for teachers to avoid creating fake social media accounts to friend their students – it's not a good idea for them to know that kind of information about their residents, and it's not their place to intervene. It's a delicate situation, and I'm not sure what the best approach is.",
            "I think the war has dragged out for far too long. Initially, the intention was good - to restore democracy in another country. However, we seem to have lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It's as if we're just doing it to prove our power, rather than to achieve a genuine purpose. I'm also concerned that the original motives were questionable, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn all honesty, I believe that if the goal was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. But I do think the war has gone on for far too long. I think we made our point in the initial stages of the conflict, with the invasion itself serving as a powerful statement. However, the fact that it's dragged on for years has made it seem like we're fighting just for the sake of fighting.\n\nIf our original intention was to free a country from tyranny, that would be a noble cause. But over time, our reasons for being there seem to have become distorted and misguided. It feels like we're still at war because we don't want to admit defeat or back down. I genuinely believe that the war has gone on long enough and it's time to bring it to an end.\n\nWe've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's not even benefiting us in the long run. We have our own problems to address, such as poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare, which could be better funded with that money. It's frustrating to think that our own citizens are being put in harm's way in a war that we're no longer fighting for a clear purpose.",
            "I have a question that I want to clarify. I was wondering if it's okay to ask, it was prevented because someone went online and found a particular issue. To be honest, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nWhen you post information on the internet, you have to accept that it's available for everyone to see. For example, on social media sites like Myspace, if you want to view someone's profile, you usually have to be their friend or join the site, which means you've given permission for them to see your profile. It's like you're giving them access to your online space.\n\nI think it's a good thing that someone was able to see this information and prevent a serious situation from happening. However, it also raises some concerns about overreach and potential discrimination. If someone is constantly monitoring students' online profiles, it could be seen as unfair.\n\nI'm not sure how this situation would work in practice. Would they be monitoring everyone's profiles, or just looking for specific information? It's a tricky issue because it's hard to balance the need for safety with the need for personal freedom. I've had my own experiences with online safety, having a Facebook account and being aware of the potential risks. I've seen cases where people have been able to gather a lot of information about someone just by looking at their online profiles.\n\nIt's a bit unsettling, to be honest. I've tried to limit the information I share online, but I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a delicate balance between being open and being safe.\n\nI heard about a case where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed a bit extreme to me. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure what the right approach is.",
            "I guess I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, but I'm going to go ahead and share my thoughts on it. I mean, I was against the war from the start, but it's not really a big deal now since everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who don't want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nLooking at recent polls, it's clear that the majority of people worldwide think the war was a bad idea. In fact, over 75 to 80% of the global population agrees with this. This includes the Iraqi people, who are the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and an astonishing 70 to 80% of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it was a dumb idea and that we should leave within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the very beginning, and now that we're trying to pull out, it's going to be a disaster as well. I think the problem lies in the cultural gap between the US and the Middle East, and the US administration's idea of imposing democracy on a region that wouldn't choose it for itself. I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, but it's not that simple. Before invading, we should have weighed the pros and cons, considering the potential consequences of turning Iraq into a disaster zone.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for staying, and concerns about what might happen if we leave, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't leave now.\n\nIt's worth noting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight. If we ask them if we should stay and they say no, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We could at least say we were trying to help, but they made the decision to leave.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, and I don't think we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least if we leave, it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "You know, I really think that gender discrimination is still a big issue in the US. I mean, it's not just about women, it's about the specific job or field you're in. For instance, women often face it more because of the \"glass ceiling\" - even when equality is supposed to exist, it can be tough for them to break through and get ahead. This is because society has been conditioned to think a certain way for so long, and it's hard to change.\n\nTake workplaces for example. Women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because it's not the norm for women to be in top positions. It's the same with men in industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. Society looks down on men who choose to be stay-at-home dads, thinking they should be the breadwinner. It's hard on them because they might have always wanted to spend time with their kids and be a part of their lives.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are straight can often be stereotyped and looked down upon. People might think, \"If you're a man in fashion, you must be doing it for women.\" It's like, how do we know what your style is like just because you're a guy? Depending on the job or field, there's definitely gender discrimination going on.\n\nIt's tough to change this mindset because society has a set way of thinking, and it's only moving slowly. But we're making progress, and women are getting more accepted in the business world and becoming CEOs. Men who are stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted. It's a slow process, but it's happening.\n\nI think the key is to promote the qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, where it's starting to become more accepted. I'm not sure what more we can do that isn't already being done, because if we move too fast, people will resist. Change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, though - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their background. If someone has a strong accent or hasn't had the best education, but is still super intelligent, they might be discriminated against by others who think they can't be taken seriously. It's not just a one-way street, and it's not just about gender.",
            "To be honest, I think the laws surrounding it are a bit confusing. My understanding is that they didn't fully legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means it's more like a traffic ticket, something you get cited for rather than being arrested and charged with a crime. \n\nI think one of the major concerns people have is the long-term consequences of getting caught with a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized. These consequences can still affect job interviews and other areas of life. However, on the other hand, not arresting people and going through the whole process can be quite costly for municipalities, which might be a reason some places don't want to make the change. \n\nIn places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I think decriminalization is a good idea. It's freed up money that can be spent on more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. \n\nIt's not a simple issue, though. While marijuana might not be as bad as some people think, there are still concerns about its widespread availability and how it might affect people's behavior. Some people might be worried about the potential for it to be smoked in public, which could be awkward for those who don't approve. \n\nIt's also worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to substances. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. \n\nOverall, I think it's a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "I agree that the Catholic Church has many traditional practices, which are good to hold onto, but also essential to adapt to change. Many Catholics attend Church every week and follow the doctrine strictly, yet sometimes it seems like the Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. It's hypocritical to teach love and acceptance while not accepting others who don't adhere to the same beliefs, especially when it comes to other religions. For instance, my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their different faiths. This lack of acceptance makes me question the Church's tolerance.\n\nIt's not just the doctrine that's a problem; the Church's practice often contradicts its teachings. The Church sticks to outdated traditions even when they no longer serve a purpose. I believe it's essential to reevaluate and update these practices to be more inclusive and accepting. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I don't think it would necessarily prevent pedophilia. Molesting children is a separate issue from marriage, and people who engage in such behavior will likely do so regardless of their marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not address the root problem, and I believe it's not a solution to the issue at hand.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this issue, to be honest.  I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong, but I do think this is a really tough topic to tackle. The line between church and state is already pretty blurry, and defining marriage is a minefield in itself. It's hard to navigate without stepping on anyone's toes. To be frank, I'm not sure what I think, but I'm starting to lean towards the idea that civil unions should be the focus. I mean, why should the government care about the specifics of a marriage, as long as it's a union between two consenting adults? It's not about the sacrament or the church; it's about two people coming together. And if we're being strict about it, civil unions would be a more accurate label, as it's the government that recognizes the union, not the church. Now, when it comes to gay marriage, I think it's just a matter of two people being in a civil union, no matter what their orientation. If all the states could come to a logical conclusion, I'd think it would be great to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure. I mean, the constitution shouldn't be amended for every little thing that gets people riled up. It's just not important enough to warrant such a big change.",
            "Honestly, I grew up in a Christian household, and as a result, I've always had a bit of a mixed perspective on homosexuality. On one hand, I have several gay friends, which has broadened my understanding and acceptance. However, I still have some reservations about that lifestyle. Despite my reservations, I think it's essential to let states decide for themselves whether to legalize gay marriage, rather than having the president impose a national policy.\n\nIt's only fair that states take the lead on this issue, given that they have different political leanings, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you live in a state that's predominantly liberal, it's likely that the majority will support gay marriage. I believe it's essential to respect the decision of the state you choose to live in, rather than trying to impose your own views.\n\nMy stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. In my opinion, it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage, based on their own values and priorities.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's unfair for the president to dictate how every state should handle this issue. Since President Bush doesn't live in every state, he shouldn't have the authority to decide how each state should govern itself. Let's face it; he'll be out of office in a few years, and a new president might reverse his policies. I believe that some decisions should be left to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of those decisions.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to have a national ban on gay marriage, as it's an issue that should be decided by each state, taking into account their unique circumstances and values.",
            "I'm not really sure about this, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're essentially sharing it with the world. If school officials are monitoring it, I think it's fair to say they have a right to do so. Even if they're not searching for students under the school's name, they could still access it from their own homes. In the end, it's all about keeping students safe, and if officials can use Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think that's a good thing. \n\nIt's kind of like what I've noticed - if administrators go on Myspace to catch students doing things they shouldn't be, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to make the school a better and safer place. Of course, this raises questions about the balance between monitoring and respecting students' privacy.\n\nThe thing is, when you post something online, it's out there forever. Even if you try to delete it, there's still a risk it could be accessed by the wrong people. I've been there myself - I've been hesitant to post something negative about someone online because I'm afraid it could come back to haunt me later on.\n\nIt's hard to express yourself when you're talking about this kind of thing, but essentially, I think that Myspace is a public space, and if officials can use it to prevent harm, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to keep students safe. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and respecting students' rights.\n\nI don't think officials should just go on Myspace to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, I think that's okay. It's kind of like what my old teacher told me - schools have to take certain measures to ensure student safety, like having lockdown drills in case of an emergency. That's basically what the school officials were doing in this case - they were trying to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.\n\nThat's pretty much it, I think.",
            "Honestly, the Iraq war is a topic that's been on my mind for a while. At first, I was all for it because my personal experience with 9/11 left a strong impression on me. I thought we should go in there and make an impact, but in hindsight, I think we were completely unprepared. We didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions, and we just rushed into it without a solid plan.\n\nLooking back, I believe we made a lot of mistakes. We overlooked the complexities of the situation and the people we were dealing with. It's like we were just reacting on emotions, rather than taking a step back and thinking things through. And now, I'm not sure if we've achieved anything. In fact, I think we might have made things worse.\n\nThe thing is, as long as the Iraqi people are fighting among themselves, they're not going to be a threat to us. So, I don't see how our presence there is making a difference. It's like we're just trying to impose our will on them, but they're not receptive to it. Sometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they're waging war and causing destruction. I don't know, maybe that's just my perception, but it's hard for me to care about what's happening over there right now.\n\nI think we should have just left them alone and let them figure things out for themselves. War is a different beast for them than it is for us. We just can't compare the two. Our goal should have been to get out of there as soon as possible and not try to impose our values on them. We were just looking for revenge, and that's not a solid reason to go to war.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a clear plan. We didn't think about the long-term consequences of our actions, and now we're stuck in a situation that's not going to get better anytime soon. I think we should just cut our losses and get out of there. It's time for us to move on and let the Iraqis deal with their own problems."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to evolve and adapt to the changing times. One reason for the decline in its following might be its rather restrictive and outdated views on various subjects. Take, for instance, the Church's stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control – these are issues where the Church's views seem to be stuck in the past. If they could update their perspective and become more accepting of modern ideas, they might not be losing followers.\n\nI've noticed that many people are increasingly alienated from the Church due to its rigid stance on these matters. Those who don't agree with the Church's views on, say, abortion, might find it challenging to be part of a community that actively discourages it. Similarly, individuals who support gay marriage or have similar views might feel unwelcome in a Church that doesn't condone it.\n\nI also think it's time for the Church to reconsider its stance on female priests and married priests. I don't see why priests can't be married or why women can't serve as priests. After all, the Church sees priests as being devoted to a higher authority, but I believe that's no reason to deny them a personal life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family, so why should priests be any different? It's time for the Church to modernize and become more inclusive.",
            "Honestly, I never thought I'd take a strong stance on gay marriage, but I have to admit that I'm not opposed to it. To me, people are either born gay or it's just part of who they are, and it's not something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them accountable for their sexual orientation. In my opinion, it's wrong to say that a man and woman can get married, but a same-sex couple can't. I mean, why should people be judged for who they are? It's not a topic I've given a lot of thought to, but it's clear to me that it's not right to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's worth considering that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can control. Like, I was born straight, and I'm pretty sure people are born gay too. It's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the government should be involved in something like this, as it's not really a legal or moral issue – it's just a matter of people being who they are. I don't think they should be judged or stigmatized for it. The government should just leave people alone and let them live their lives.\n\nIt's hard to understand why the government feels it's necessary to interfere in people's personal lives like this. It's not like it affects national security or anything. They just seem to be overstepping their bounds and imposing their opinions on people who don't really need it. To me, it's about accepting people for who they are and not trying to change them or punish them for being different. That's just not right.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm of the opinion that gay marriage should be legalized. There's not really a solid reason why it shouldn't be. Some people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's a misconception. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're two different things.\n\nThere are many aspects to consider, and it's hard to draw parallels between the two. It's like two sides of the same coin – you can't have one without the other. Civil rights come into play, such as property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit your partner in the hospital. It seems unfair that these rights aren't extended to same-sex couples.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples. It's all about the relationship itself, not the orientation of the individuals involved. The problem lies in the fact that people are getting hung up on the idea of church and state. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nIf we separate church and state, then it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation – separate but unequal. In a legal sense, if you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage? The main points of contention seem to be adoption issues, community concerns, and the potential impact on children raised by gay parents.\n\nSome people worry about how children will adjust to societal norms and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. However, it's hard to say for certain, especially when it comes to adoption. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In places like New York City, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and exclusion in public schools.\n\nUltimately, parenting skills are the same regardless of orientation. It comes down to individual personality choices, not the couple's makeup. I think the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal across the board. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage seem to be rooted in his personal moral code, which is influenced by his religion. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its moral views on the rest of the country, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and the separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has debunked this notion. Instead of listening to popular opinion or personal biases, we should rely on research and studies to inform our views on this issue.",
            "You know, I work at the hospital pharmacy and I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. I mean, it's pretty clear that if it's available for the public, I don't think it's a good idea. No way, not at all. But if we're talking about using it for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, even if something is illegal, it doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's a pretty simple idea, but some people just don't get it.\n\nFor example, there are loads of controlled substances that we use in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're basically off-limits to the public, but we use them all the time because they're actually pretty useful. And if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it, that doesn't make any sense to me. I think we should just accept its potential benefits and not be so judgmental.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think marijuana is that similar to alcohol, even though abusing either one can have negative consequences. But if we're talking about making it legal, I'd say it's better to do it gradually, not all at once. If we just remove the taboo around marijuana and people start to use it responsibly, that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really negative image of marijuana because it's seen as an illicit substance. But the truth is, it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. And if we can change that perception, maybe people will start to use it more sensibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern era. They're no longer as strict as they used to be. I can compare this to my own experiences growing up - I used to attend church every Sunday and get dressed up in matching outfits, but now they've introduced a more casual teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress down, even at the morning masses, and it's not uncommon to see families rushing in late or wearing beachwear. I think this shift towards casualness is a big change.\n\nTo be honest, that's the most noticeable thing to me about the church I'm familiar with. I'm not sure about the church's internal politics, but that's pretty much it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind lately is the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think these issues would have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Some men who are married still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not necessarily about their marital status. It's about the individual's character. I also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone wants to practice their faith while being married, they might consider a different religion. For example, some denominations allow their clergy to be married.\n\nIn my opinion, it's the individual's genetics that determine their sexuality, not their upbringing. I don't think people just develop these tendencies; they're born with them. You can't hide that through a marriage, and it's likely to come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done much to prevent these issues from happening. If they did know about it and tried to cover it up, that's a different story altogether, but I don't think that was always the case.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have anything to add.",
            "I mean, I was initially okay with the idea of the war, but I strongly felt that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and that we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext, with a bunch of pretexts leading us there. \n\nI think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which we later found out was all a lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. \n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who made that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. It's clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. \n\nIt's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he was also hoping to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nI think the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now would probably lead to chaos and more deaths, as the country could slide into civil war. The alternative being considered now is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either, as it would raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and could lead to more problems in the long run. \n\nThe interim government is failing, and the Parliament isn't effective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the political process. Even the anti-American cleric, Muktada al-Sadr, has a significant presence in the Parliament now, and there are still radical elements vying for control of the government, causing a lot of friction in the political process. \n\nHonestly, I don't have a solution that I can articulate without offending anyone.",
            "I'm thinking about the War in Iraq, and it's not easy to form a clear opinion. I mean, it's not even considered a declared war. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, kind of like in the US, and also to gain access to their oil resources. But the problem is, it's causing a lot of tension and upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to try to build democracy, which is a long-term process that can't be rushed. And if we leave, the Iraqis might be angry that we messed things up and they'll have to start from scratch. This whole situation is really complicated.\n\nI think the war is hard to wrap my head around, and I'm not sure what to say. I don't really know much about it. Do you have any other topics we can discuss?\n\nBut, if I'm being honest, I think the war should continue, but only because people are being forced to fight. I don't think we should call it a war anymore, though. I think it's more about showing off our military strength and power. It never should have been called a war in the first place, since it was never officially declared by Congress. You have to declare a war through Congress to make it official.\n\nI think we should be helping Iraq, but it's also a waste of our resources. And especially now, with Bush being president, it's making him look really bad. He's getting a bad reputation because of the war's impact and the way it's affecting people. Remember the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless conflict. I don't want Bush to be known as the president who started another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to be safe, but at the same time, I don't think we should be trying to mold them into a second US, which would only make things worse. The culture is so different, and I'm worried that our attempts to change them will only fuel more hatred towards the US. The Al-Qaeda situation will probably get worse, and we'll be stuck in a never-ending conflict.\n\nI think this whole situation will drag on for years to come. That's my take on it, I guess.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with making it a law or even letting the government decide it's legal. I think it's something that should be up to the churches, considering what the constitution says about separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that this is something that's already been stated and established. Trying to exert any kind of control over it would be a pretty big defiance of the constitution's principles.\n\nI think the people pushing to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what's allowed or not for the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, and it's what allows for religious tolerance in the US. I think trying to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government, which I don't think is right at all.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, and it's basically showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the government, and there's no real reason to back it up other than personal views.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see how it would have a major impact on the economy or anything else. If anything, it might even have a positive impact on society. I'm not sure how, but I think it could be a good thing.\n\nI've pretty much said it all, so I'm not sure I have much more to add.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely truthful about the reasons for going to war before invading the country. I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it wasn't as directly related as they made it out to be. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using the outrage from the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war.\n\nI personally oppose war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would occur.\n\nThey're trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted to do in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult process, and not a clear-cut victory. It's hard to fight an insurgency when you're fighting against the citizens of the country, not a traditional army.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes and been more prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. They weren't, and now we're still in Iraq, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. We're still training the Iraqi troops and police to take control of their own country, which is a long process.\n\nI believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn't be so naive about the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful. Democracy was a long struggle in our own country, and it's not an easy thing to achieve.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you consider the number of American casualties and the cost of continuing the war. I think we should try to see it through, but it's also important to consider the human cost and the question of whether it's worth it.\n\nOne of my concerns is that the war in Iraq is partly about oil and controlling resources. We invaded Iraq supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but we're not doing the same thing in other countries with similar issues. I think the US government isn't being entirely truthful about their motives and decisions.\n\nLet's hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon.",
            "I mean, I'm for gay marriage, and I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been shown to be biological rather than a result of societal influences. I think it's unfair to deprive people of rights due to something they can't control, which is their sexual orientation. It's almost inhumane, and I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this, it's a personal, household-level issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily business, and it's no different from any other family.\n\nI think it's ridiculous that Bush is trying to impose his interpretation of marriage on everyone else. It's clear that there's a biological component to being gay, and it's not something people choose. Research suggests that there's a chemical aspect to it, something people are predisposed to, rather than a result of their upbringing or environment.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's publicly scrutinized. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without drawing attention to themselves, but if a same-sex couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a major news event. It's just not right.",
            "Uh, I mean, when you post something online, it becomes public knowledge. It's completely out there, and you can't take it back. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. Once you share something online, it can shape people's perceptions of you, and that's a fact.\n\nIf you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably respond, and it can get out of hand. The internet is a public forum, and if you're connected to that person on social media, you'll likely see their messages. It's not the school that receives the message; it's someone who's seen it and decides to report it.\n\nSchool administrators have to act on it because they can't just ignore it, or they might miss an opportunity to prevent something serious from happening. It's a tough call, because you don't always know what to take seriously – it could be a joke or a serious threat.\n\nIn a recent situation, someone overheard a friend talking about something, and when we looked into it, we found some concerning posts on their social media account. It's a bit of a double-edged sword: you can't control what people think, and you can't dictate what they take seriously. If you don't want something shared, don't put it online.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media or snoop through their accounts. If something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously, but that's different from monitoring personal conversations or messages. It's a fine line to walk.\n\nI think it's a good idea for teachers to avoid creating fake social media accounts to friend their students – it's not a good idea for them to know that kind of information about their residents, and it's not their place to intervene. It's a delicate situation, and I'm not sure what the best approach is.",
            "I think the war has dragged out for far too long. Initially, the intention was good - to restore democracy in another country. However, we seem to have lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It's as if we're just doing it to prove our power, rather than to achieve a genuine purpose. I'm also concerned that the original motives were questionable, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn all honesty, I believe that if the goal was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. But I do think the war has gone on for far too long. I think we made our point in the initial stages of the conflict, with the invasion itself serving as a powerful statement. However, the fact that it's dragged on for years has made it seem like we're fighting just for the sake of fighting.\n\nIf our original intention was to free a country from tyranny, that would be a noble cause. But over time, our reasons for being there seem to have become distorted and misguided. It feels like we're still at war because we don't want to admit defeat or back down. I genuinely believe that the war has gone on long enough and it's time to bring it to an end.\n\nWe've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's not even benefiting us in the long run. We have our own problems to address, such as poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare, which could be better funded with that money. It's frustrating to think that our own citizens are being put in harm's way in a war that we're no longer fighting for a clear purpose.",
            "I have a question that I want to clarify. I was wondering if it's okay to ask, it was prevented because someone went online and found a particular issue. To be honest, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nWhen you post information on the internet, you have to accept that it's available for everyone to see. For example, on social media sites like Myspace, if you want to view someone's profile, you usually have to be their friend or join the site, which means you've given permission for them to see your profile. It's like you're giving them access to your online space.\n\nI think it's a good thing that someone was able to see this information and prevent a serious situation from happening. However, it also raises some concerns about overreach and potential discrimination. If someone is constantly monitoring students' online profiles, it could be seen as unfair.\n\nI'm not sure how this situation would work in practice. Would they be monitoring everyone's profiles, or just looking for specific information? It's a tricky issue because it's hard to balance the need for safety with the need for personal freedom. I've had my own experiences with online safety, having a Facebook account and being aware of the potential risks. I've seen cases where people have been able to gather a lot of information about someone just by looking at their online profiles.\n\nIt's a bit unsettling, to be honest. I've tried to limit the information I share online, but I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a delicate balance between being open and being safe.\n\nI heard about a case where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed a bit extreme to me. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure what the right approach is.",
            "I guess I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, but I'm going to go ahead and share my thoughts on it. I mean, I was against the war from the start, but it's not really a big deal now since everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who don't want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nLooking at recent polls, it's clear that the majority of people worldwide think the war was a bad idea. In fact, over 75 to 80% of the global population agrees with this. This includes the Iraqi people, who are the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and an astonishing 70 to 80% of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it was a dumb idea and that we should leave within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the very beginning, and now that we're trying to pull out, it's going to be a disaster as well. I think the problem lies in the cultural gap between the US and the Middle East, and the US administration's idea of imposing democracy on a region that wouldn't choose it for itself. I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, but it's not that simple. Before invading, we should have weighed the pros and cons, considering the potential consequences of turning Iraq into a disaster zone.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for staying, and concerns about what might happen if we leave, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't leave now.\n\nIt's worth noting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight. If we ask them if we should stay and they say no, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We could at least say we were trying to help, but they made the decision to leave.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, and I don't think we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least if we leave, it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "You know, I really think that gender discrimination is still a big issue in the US. I mean, it's not just about women, it's about the specific job or field you're in. For instance, women often face it more because of the \"glass ceiling\" - even when equality is supposed to exist, it can be tough for them to break through and get ahead. This is because society has been conditioned to think a certain way for so long, and it's hard to change.\n\nTake workplaces for example. Women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because it's not the norm for women to be in top positions. It's the same with men in industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. Society looks down on men who choose to be stay-at-home dads, thinking they should be the breadwinner. It's hard on them because they might have always wanted to spend time with their kids and be a part of their lives.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are straight can often be stereotyped and looked down upon. People might think, \"If you're a man in fashion, you must be doing it for women.\" It's like, how do we know what your style is like just because you're a guy? Depending on the job or field, there's definitely gender discrimination going on.\n\nIt's tough to change this mindset because society has a set way of thinking, and it's only moving slowly. But we're making progress, and women are getting more accepted in the business world and becoming CEOs. Men who are stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted. It's a slow process, but it's happening.\n\nI think the key is to promote the qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, where it's starting to become more accepted. I'm not sure what more we can do that isn't already being done, because if we move too fast, people will resist. Change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, though - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their background. If someone has a strong accent or hasn't had the best education, but is still super intelligent, they might be discriminated against by others who think they can't be taken seriously. It's not just a one-way street, and it's not just about gender.",
            "To be honest, I think the laws surrounding it are a bit confusing. My understanding is that they didn't fully legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means it's more like a traffic ticket, something you get cited for rather than being arrested and charged with a crime. \n\nI think one of the major concerns people have is the long-term consequences of getting caught with a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized. These consequences can still affect job interviews and other areas of life. However, on the other hand, not arresting people and going through the whole process can be quite costly for municipalities, which might be a reason some places don't want to make the change. \n\nIn places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I think decriminalization is a good idea. It's freed up money that can be spent on more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. \n\nIt's not a simple issue, though. While marijuana might not be as bad as some people think, there are still concerns about its widespread availability and how it might affect people's behavior. Some people might be worried about the potential for it to be smoked in public, which could be awkward for those who don't approve. \n\nIt's also worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to substances. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. \n\nOverall, I think it's a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "I agree that the Catholic Church has many traditional practices, which are good to hold onto, but also essential to adapt to change. Many Catholics attend Church every week and follow the doctrine strictly, yet sometimes it seems like the Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. It's hypocritical to teach love and acceptance while not accepting others who don't adhere to the same beliefs, especially when it comes to other religions. For instance, my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their different faiths. This lack of acceptance makes me question the Church's tolerance.\n\nIt's not just the doctrine that's a problem; the Church's practice often contradicts its teachings. The Church sticks to outdated traditions even when they no longer serve a purpose. I believe it's essential to reevaluate and update these practices to be more inclusive and accepting. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I don't think it would necessarily prevent pedophilia. Molesting children is a separate issue from marriage, and people who engage in such behavior will likely do so regardless of their marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not address the root problem, and I believe it's not a solution to the issue at hand.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this issue, to be honest.  I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong, but I do think this is a really tough topic to tackle. The line between church and state is already pretty blurry, and defining marriage is a minefield in itself. It's hard to navigate without stepping on anyone's toes. To be frank, I'm not sure what I think, but I'm starting to lean towards the idea that civil unions should be the focus. I mean, why should the government care about the specifics of a marriage, as long as it's a union between two consenting adults? It's not about the sacrament or the church; it's about two people coming together. And if we're being strict about it, civil unions would be a more accurate label, as it's the government that recognizes the union, not the church. Now, when it comes to gay marriage, I think it's just a matter of two people being in a civil union, no matter what their orientation. If all the states could come to a logical conclusion, I'd think it would be great to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure. I mean, the constitution shouldn't be amended for every little thing that gets people riled up. It's just not important enough to warrant such a big change.",
            "Honestly, I grew up in a Christian household, and as a result, I've always had a bit of a mixed perspective on homosexuality. On one hand, I have several gay friends, which has broadened my understanding and acceptance. However, I still have some reservations about that lifestyle. Despite my reservations, I think it's essential to let states decide for themselves whether to legalize gay marriage, rather than having the president impose a national policy.\n\nIt's only fair that states take the lead on this issue, given that they have different political leanings, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you live in a state that's predominantly liberal, it's likely that the majority will support gay marriage. I believe it's essential to respect the decision of the state you choose to live in, rather than trying to impose your own views.\n\nMy stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. In my opinion, it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage, based on their own values and priorities.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's unfair for the president to dictate how every state should handle this issue. Since President Bush doesn't live in every state, he shouldn't have the authority to decide how each state should govern itself. Let's face it; he'll be out of office in a few years, and a new president might reverse his policies. I believe that some decisions should be left to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of those decisions.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to have a national ban on gay marriage, as it's an issue that should be decided by each state, taking into account their unique circumstances and values.",
            "I'm not really sure about this, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're essentially sharing it with the world. If school officials are monitoring it, I think it's fair to say they have a right to do so. Even if they're not searching for students under the school's name, they could still access it from their own homes. In the end, it's all about keeping students safe, and if officials can use Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think that's a good thing. \n\nIt's kind of like what I've noticed - if administrators go on Myspace to catch students doing things they shouldn't be, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to make the school a better and safer place. Of course, this raises questions about the balance between monitoring and respecting students' privacy.\n\nThe thing is, when you post something online, it's out there forever. Even if you try to delete it, there's still a risk it could be accessed by the wrong people. I've been there myself - I've been hesitant to post something negative about someone online because I'm afraid it could come back to haunt me later on.\n\nIt's hard to express yourself when you're talking about this kind of thing, but essentially, I think that Myspace is a public space, and if officials can use it to prevent harm, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to keep students safe. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and respecting students' rights.\n\nI don't think officials should just go on Myspace to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, I think that's okay. It's kind of like what my old teacher told me - schools have to take certain measures to ensure student safety, like having lockdown drills in case of an emergency. That's basically what the school officials were doing in this case - they were trying to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.\n\nThat's pretty much it, I think.",
            "Honestly, the Iraq war is a topic that's been on my mind for a while. At first, I was all for it because my personal experience with 9/11 left a strong impression on me. I thought we should go in there and make an impact, but in hindsight, I think we were completely unprepared. We didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions, and we just rushed into it without a solid plan.\n\nLooking back, I believe we made a lot of mistakes. We overlooked the complexities of the situation and the people we were dealing with. It's like we were just reacting on emotions, rather than taking a step back and thinking things through. And now, I'm not sure if we've achieved anything. In fact, I think we might have made things worse.\n\nThe thing is, as long as the Iraqi people are fighting among themselves, they're not going to be a threat to us. So, I don't see how our presence there is making a difference. It's like we're just trying to impose our will on them, but they're not receptive to it. Sometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they're waging war and causing destruction. I don't know, maybe that's just my perception, but it's hard for me to care about what's happening over there right now.\n\nI think we should have just left them alone and let them figure things out for themselves. War is a different beast for them than it is for us. We just can't compare the two. Our goal should have been to get out of there as soon as possible and not try to impose our values on them. We were just looking for revenge, and that's not a solid reason to go to war.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a clear plan. We didn't think about the long-term consequences of our actions, and now we're stuck in a situation that's not going to get better anytime soon. I think we should just cut our losses and get out of there. It's time for us to move on and let the Iraqis deal with their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to evolve and adapt to the changing times. One reason for the decline in its following might be its rather restrictive and outdated views on various subjects. Take, for instance, the Church's stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control – these are issues where the Church's views seem to be stuck in the past. If they could update their perspective and become more accepting of modern ideas, they might not be losing followers.\n\nI've noticed that many people are increasingly alienated from the Church due to its rigid stance on these matters. Those who don't agree with the Church's views on, say, abortion, might find it challenging to be part of a community that actively discourages it. Similarly, individuals who support gay marriage or have similar views might feel unwelcome in a Church that doesn't condone it.\n\nI also think it's time for the Church to reconsider its stance on female priests and married priests. I don't see why priests can't be married or why women can't serve as priests. After all, the Church sees priests as being devoted to a higher authority, but I believe that's no reason to deny them a personal life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family, so why should priests be any different? It's time for the Church to modernize and become more inclusive.",
            "Honestly, I never thought I'd take a strong stance on gay marriage, but I have to admit that I'm not opposed to it. To me, people are either born gay or it's just part of who they are, and it's not something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them accountable for their sexual orientation. In my opinion, it's wrong to say that a man and woman can get married, but a same-sex couple can't. I mean, why should people be judged for who they are? It's not a topic I've given a lot of thought to, but it's clear to me that it's not right to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's worth considering that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can control. Like, I was born straight, and I'm pretty sure people are born gay too. It's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the government should be involved in something like this, as it's not really a legal or moral issue – it's just a matter of people being who they are. I don't think they should be judged or stigmatized for it. The government should just leave people alone and let them live their lives.\n\nIt's hard to understand why the government feels it's necessary to interfere in people's personal lives like this. It's not like it affects national security or anything. They just seem to be overstepping their bounds and imposing their opinions on people who don't really need it. To me, it's about accepting people for who they are and not trying to change them or punish them for being different. That's just not right.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm of the opinion that gay marriage should be legalized. There's not really a solid reason why it shouldn't be. Some people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's a misconception. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're two different things.\n\nThere are many aspects to consider, and it's hard to draw parallels between the two. It's like two sides of the same coin – you can't have one without the other. Civil rights come into play, such as property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit your partner in the hospital. It seems unfair that these rights aren't extended to same-sex couples.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples. It's all about the relationship itself, not the orientation of the individuals involved. The problem lies in the fact that people are getting hung up on the idea of church and state. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nIf we separate church and state, then it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation – separate but unequal. In a legal sense, if you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage? The main points of contention seem to be adoption issues, community concerns, and the potential impact on children raised by gay parents.\n\nSome people worry about how children will adjust to societal norms and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. However, it's hard to say for certain, especially when it comes to adoption. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In places like New York City, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and exclusion in public schools.\n\nUltimately, parenting skills are the same regardless of orientation. It comes down to individual personality choices, not the couple's makeup. I think the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal across the board. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage seem to be rooted in his personal moral code, which is influenced by his religion. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its moral views on the rest of the country, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and the separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has debunked this notion. Instead of listening to popular opinion or personal biases, we should rely on research and studies to inform our views on this issue.",
            "You know, I work at the hospital pharmacy and I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. I mean, it's pretty clear that if it's available for the public, I don't think it's a good idea. No way, not at all. But if we're talking about using it for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, even if something is illegal, it doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's a pretty simple idea, but some people just don't get it.\n\nFor example, there are loads of controlled substances that we use in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're basically off-limits to the public, but we use them all the time because they're actually pretty useful. And if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it, that doesn't make any sense to me. I think we should just accept its potential benefits and not be so judgmental.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think marijuana is that similar to alcohol, even though abusing either one can have negative consequences. But if we're talking about making it legal, I'd say it's better to do it gradually, not all at once. If we just remove the taboo around marijuana and people start to use it responsibly, that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really negative image of marijuana because it's seen as an illicit substance. But the truth is, it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. And if we can change that perception, maybe people will start to use it more sensibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern era. They're no longer as strict as they used to be. I can compare this to my own experiences growing up - I used to attend church every Sunday and get dressed up in matching outfits, but now they've introduced a more casual teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress down, even at the morning masses, and it's not uncommon to see families rushing in late or wearing beachwear. I think this shift towards casualness is a big change.\n\nTo be honest, that's the most noticeable thing to me about the church I'm familiar with. I'm not sure about the church's internal politics, but that's pretty much it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind lately is the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think these issues would have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Some men who are married still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not necessarily about their marital status. It's about the individual's character. I also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone wants to practice their faith while being married, they might consider a different religion. For example, some denominations allow their clergy to be married.\n\nIn my opinion, it's the individual's genetics that determine their sexuality, not their upbringing. I don't think people just develop these tendencies; they're born with them. You can't hide that through a marriage, and it's likely to come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done much to prevent these issues from happening. If they did know about it and tried to cover it up, that's a different story altogether, but I don't think that was always the case.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have anything to add.",
            "I mean, I was initially okay with the idea of the war, but I strongly felt that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and that we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext, with a bunch of pretexts leading us there. \n\nI think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which we later found out was all a lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. \n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who made that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. It's clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. \n\nIt's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he was also hoping to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nI think the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now would probably lead to chaos and more deaths, as the country could slide into civil war. The alternative being considered now is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either, as it would raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and could lead to more problems in the long run. \n\nThe interim government is failing, and the Parliament isn't effective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the political process. Even the anti-American cleric, Muktada al-Sadr, has a significant presence in the Parliament now, and there are still radical elements vying for control of the government, causing a lot of friction in the political process. \n\nHonestly, I don't have a solution that I can articulate without offending anyone.",
            "I'm thinking about the War in Iraq, and it's not easy to form a clear opinion. I mean, it's not even considered a declared war. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, kind of like in the US, and also to gain access to their oil resources. But the problem is, it's causing a lot of tension and upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to try to build democracy, which is a long-term process that can't be rushed. And if we leave, the Iraqis might be angry that we messed things up and they'll have to start from scratch. This whole situation is really complicated.\n\nI think the war is hard to wrap my head around, and I'm not sure what to say. I don't really know much about it. Do you have any other topics we can discuss?\n\nBut, if I'm being honest, I think the war should continue, but only because people are being forced to fight. I don't think we should call it a war anymore, though. I think it's more about showing off our military strength and power. It never should have been called a war in the first place, since it was never officially declared by Congress. You have to declare a war through Congress to make it official.\n\nI think we should be helping Iraq, but it's also a waste of our resources. And especially now, with Bush being president, it's making him look really bad. He's getting a bad reputation because of the war's impact and the way it's affecting people. Remember the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless conflict. I don't want Bush to be known as the president who started another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to be safe, but at the same time, I don't think we should be trying to mold them into a second US, which would only make things worse. The culture is so different, and I'm worried that our attempts to change them will only fuel more hatred towards the US. The Al-Qaeda situation will probably get worse, and we'll be stuck in a never-ending conflict.\n\nI think this whole situation will drag on for years to come. That's my take on it, I guess.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with making it a law or even letting the government decide it's legal. I think it's something that should be up to the churches, considering what the constitution says about separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that this is something that's already been stated and established. Trying to exert any kind of control over it would be a pretty big defiance of the constitution's principles.\n\nI think the people pushing to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what's allowed or not for the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, and it's what allows for religious tolerance in the US. I think trying to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government, which I don't think is right at all.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, and it's basically showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the government, and there's no real reason to back it up other than personal views.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see how it would have a major impact on the economy or anything else. If anything, it might even have a positive impact on society. I'm not sure how, but I think it could be a good thing.\n\nI've pretty much said it all, so I'm not sure I have much more to add.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely truthful about the reasons for going to war before invading the country. I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it wasn't as directly related as they made it out to be. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using the outrage from the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war.\n\nI personally oppose war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would occur.\n\nThey're trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted to do in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult process, and not a clear-cut victory. It's hard to fight an insurgency when you're fighting against the citizens of the country, not a traditional army.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes and been more prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. They weren't, and now we're still in Iraq, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. We're still training the Iraqi troops and police to take control of their own country, which is a long process.\n\nI believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn't be so naive about the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful. Democracy was a long struggle in our own country, and it's not an easy thing to achieve.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you consider the number of American casualties and the cost of continuing the war. I think we should try to see it through, but it's also important to consider the human cost and the question of whether it's worth it.\n\nOne of my concerns is that the war in Iraq is partly about oil and controlling resources. We invaded Iraq supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but we're not doing the same thing in other countries with similar issues. I think the US government isn't being entirely truthful about their motives and decisions.\n\nLet's hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon.",
            "I mean, I'm for gay marriage, and I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been shown to be biological rather than a result of societal influences. I think it's unfair to deprive people of rights due to something they can't control, which is their sexual orientation. It's almost inhumane, and I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this, it's a personal, household-level issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily business, and it's no different from any other family.\n\nI think it's ridiculous that Bush is trying to impose his interpretation of marriage on everyone else. It's clear that there's a biological component to being gay, and it's not something people choose. Research suggests that there's a chemical aspect to it, something people are predisposed to, rather than a result of their upbringing or environment.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's publicly scrutinized. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without drawing attention to themselves, but if a same-sex couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a major news event. It's just not right.",
            "Uh, I mean, when you post something online, it becomes public knowledge. It's completely out there, and you can't take it back. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. Once you share something online, it can shape people's perceptions of you, and that's a fact.\n\nIf you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably respond, and it can get out of hand. The internet is a public forum, and if you're connected to that person on social media, you'll likely see their messages. It's not the school that receives the message; it's someone who's seen it and decides to report it.\n\nSchool administrators have to act on it because they can't just ignore it, or they might miss an opportunity to prevent something serious from happening. It's a tough call, because you don't always know what to take seriously – it could be a joke or a serious threat.\n\nIn a recent situation, someone overheard a friend talking about something, and when we looked into it, we found some concerning posts on their social media account. It's a bit of a double-edged sword: you can't control what people think, and you can't dictate what they take seriously. If you don't want something shared, don't put it online.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media or snoop through their accounts. If something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously, but that's different from monitoring personal conversations or messages. It's a fine line to walk.\n\nI think it's a good idea for teachers to avoid creating fake social media accounts to friend their students – it's not a good idea for them to know that kind of information about their residents, and it's not their place to intervene. It's a delicate situation, and I'm not sure what the best approach is.",
            "I think the war has dragged out for far too long. Initially, the intention was good - to restore democracy in another country. However, we seem to have lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It's as if we're just doing it to prove our power, rather than to achieve a genuine purpose. I'm also concerned that the original motives were questionable, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn all honesty, I believe that if the goal was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. But I do think the war has gone on for far too long. I think we made our point in the initial stages of the conflict, with the invasion itself serving as a powerful statement. However, the fact that it's dragged on for years has made it seem like we're fighting just for the sake of fighting.\n\nIf our original intention was to free a country from tyranny, that would be a noble cause. But over time, our reasons for being there seem to have become distorted and misguided. It feels like we're still at war because we don't want to admit defeat or back down. I genuinely believe that the war has gone on long enough and it's time to bring it to an end.\n\nWe've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's not even benefiting us in the long run. We have our own problems to address, such as poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare, which could be better funded with that money. It's frustrating to think that our own citizens are being put in harm's way in a war that we're no longer fighting for a clear purpose.",
            "I have a question that I want to clarify. I was wondering if it's okay to ask, it was prevented because someone went online and found a particular issue. To be honest, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nWhen you post information on the internet, you have to accept that it's available for everyone to see. For example, on social media sites like Myspace, if you want to view someone's profile, you usually have to be their friend or join the site, which means you've given permission for them to see your profile. It's like you're giving them access to your online space.\n\nI think it's a good thing that someone was able to see this information and prevent a serious situation from happening. However, it also raises some concerns about overreach and potential discrimination. If someone is constantly monitoring students' online profiles, it could be seen as unfair.\n\nI'm not sure how this situation would work in practice. Would they be monitoring everyone's profiles, or just looking for specific information? It's a tricky issue because it's hard to balance the need for safety with the need for personal freedom. I've had my own experiences with online safety, having a Facebook account and being aware of the potential risks. I've seen cases where people have been able to gather a lot of information about someone just by looking at their online profiles.\n\nIt's a bit unsettling, to be honest. I've tried to limit the information I share online, but I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a delicate balance between being open and being safe.\n\nI heard about a case where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed a bit extreme to me. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure what the right approach is.",
            "I guess I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, but I'm going to go ahead and share my thoughts on it. I mean, I was against the war from the start, but it's not really a big deal now since everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who don't want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nLooking at recent polls, it's clear that the majority of people worldwide think the war was a bad idea. In fact, over 75 to 80% of the global population agrees with this. This includes the Iraqi people, who are the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and an astonishing 70 to 80% of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it was a dumb idea and that we should leave within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the very beginning, and now that we're trying to pull out, it's going to be a disaster as well. I think the problem lies in the cultural gap between the US and the Middle East, and the US administration's idea of imposing democracy on a region that wouldn't choose it for itself. I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, but it's not that simple. Before invading, we should have weighed the pros and cons, considering the potential consequences of turning Iraq into a disaster zone.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for staying, and concerns about what might happen if we leave, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't leave now.\n\nIt's worth noting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight. If we ask them if we should stay and they say no, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We could at least say we were trying to help, but they made the decision to leave.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, and I don't think we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least if we leave, it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "You know, I really think that gender discrimination is still a big issue in the US. I mean, it's not just about women, it's about the specific job or field you're in. For instance, women often face it more because of the \"glass ceiling\" - even when equality is supposed to exist, it can be tough for them to break through and get ahead. This is because society has been conditioned to think a certain way for so long, and it's hard to change.\n\nTake workplaces for example. Women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because it's not the norm for women to be in top positions. It's the same with men in industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. Society looks down on men who choose to be stay-at-home dads, thinking they should be the breadwinner. It's hard on them because they might have always wanted to spend time with their kids and be a part of their lives.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are straight can often be stereotyped and looked down upon. People might think, \"If you're a man in fashion, you must be doing it for women.\" It's like, how do we know what your style is like just because you're a guy? Depending on the job or field, there's definitely gender discrimination going on.\n\nIt's tough to change this mindset because society has a set way of thinking, and it's only moving slowly. But we're making progress, and women are getting more accepted in the business world and becoming CEOs. Men who are stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted. It's a slow process, but it's happening.\n\nI think the key is to promote the qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, where it's starting to become more accepted. I'm not sure what more we can do that isn't already being done, because if we move too fast, people will resist. Change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, though - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their background. If someone has a strong accent or hasn't had the best education, but is still super intelligent, they might be discriminated against by others who think they can't be taken seriously. It's not just a one-way street, and it's not just about gender.",
            "To be honest, I think the laws surrounding it are a bit confusing. My understanding is that they didn't fully legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means it's more like a traffic ticket, something you get cited for rather than being arrested and charged with a crime. \n\nI think one of the major concerns people have is the long-term consequences of getting caught with a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized. These consequences can still affect job interviews and other areas of life. However, on the other hand, not arresting people and going through the whole process can be quite costly for municipalities, which might be a reason some places don't want to make the change. \n\nIn places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I think decriminalization is a good idea. It's freed up money that can be spent on more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. \n\nIt's not a simple issue, though. While marijuana might not be as bad as some people think, there are still concerns about its widespread availability and how it might affect people's behavior. Some people might be worried about the potential for it to be smoked in public, which could be awkward for those who don't approve. \n\nIt's also worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to substances. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. \n\nOverall, I think it's a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "I agree that the Catholic Church has many traditional practices, which are good to hold onto, but also essential to adapt to change. Many Catholics attend Church every week and follow the doctrine strictly, yet sometimes it seems like the Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. It's hypocritical to teach love and acceptance while not accepting others who don't adhere to the same beliefs, especially when it comes to other religions. For instance, my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their different faiths. This lack of acceptance makes me question the Church's tolerance.\n\nIt's not just the doctrine that's a problem; the Church's practice often contradicts its teachings. The Church sticks to outdated traditions even when they no longer serve a purpose. I believe it's essential to reevaluate and update these practices to be more inclusive and accepting. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I don't think it would necessarily prevent pedophilia. Molesting children is a separate issue from marriage, and people who engage in such behavior will likely do so regardless of their marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not address the root problem, and I believe it's not a solution to the issue at hand.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this issue, to be honest.  I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong, but I do think this is a really tough topic to tackle. The line between church and state is already pretty blurry, and defining marriage is a minefield in itself. It's hard to navigate without stepping on anyone's toes. To be frank, I'm not sure what I think, but I'm starting to lean towards the idea that civil unions should be the focus. I mean, why should the government care about the specifics of a marriage, as long as it's a union between two consenting adults? It's not about the sacrament or the church; it's about two people coming together. And if we're being strict about it, civil unions would be a more accurate label, as it's the government that recognizes the union, not the church. Now, when it comes to gay marriage, I think it's just a matter of two people being in a civil union, no matter what their orientation. If all the states could come to a logical conclusion, I'd think it would be great to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure. I mean, the constitution shouldn't be amended for every little thing that gets people riled up. It's just not important enough to warrant such a big change.",
            "Honestly, I grew up in a Christian household, and as a result, I've always had a bit of a mixed perspective on homosexuality. On one hand, I have several gay friends, which has broadened my understanding and acceptance. However, I still have some reservations about that lifestyle. Despite my reservations, I think it's essential to let states decide for themselves whether to legalize gay marriage, rather than having the president impose a national policy.\n\nIt's only fair that states take the lead on this issue, given that they have different political leanings, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you live in a state that's predominantly liberal, it's likely that the majority will support gay marriage. I believe it's essential to respect the decision of the state you choose to live in, rather than trying to impose your own views.\n\nMy stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. In my opinion, it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage, based on their own values and priorities.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's unfair for the president to dictate how every state should handle this issue. Since President Bush doesn't live in every state, he shouldn't have the authority to decide how each state should govern itself. Let's face it; he'll be out of office in a few years, and a new president might reverse his policies. I believe that some decisions should be left to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of those decisions.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to have a national ban on gay marriage, as it's an issue that should be decided by each state, taking into account their unique circumstances and values.",
            "I'm not really sure about this, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're essentially sharing it with the world. If school officials are monitoring it, I think it's fair to say they have a right to do so. Even if they're not searching for students under the school's name, they could still access it from their own homes. In the end, it's all about keeping students safe, and if officials can use Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think that's a good thing. \n\nIt's kind of like what I've noticed - if administrators go on Myspace to catch students doing things they shouldn't be, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to make the school a better and safer place. Of course, this raises questions about the balance between monitoring and respecting students' privacy.\n\nThe thing is, when you post something online, it's out there forever. Even if you try to delete it, there's still a risk it could be accessed by the wrong people. I've been there myself - I've been hesitant to post something negative about someone online because I'm afraid it could come back to haunt me later on.\n\nIt's hard to express yourself when you're talking about this kind of thing, but essentially, I think that Myspace is a public space, and if officials can use it to prevent harm, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to keep students safe. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and respecting students' rights.\n\nI don't think officials should just go on Myspace to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, I think that's okay. It's kind of like what my old teacher told me - schools have to take certain measures to ensure student safety, like having lockdown drills in case of an emergency. That's basically what the school officials were doing in this case - they were trying to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.\n\nThat's pretty much it, I think.",
            "Honestly, the Iraq war is a topic that's been on my mind for a while. At first, I was all for it because my personal experience with 9/11 left a strong impression on me. I thought we should go in there and make an impact, but in hindsight, I think we were completely unprepared. We didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions, and we just rushed into it without a solid plan.\n\nLooking back, I believe we made a lot of mistakes. We overlooked the complexities of the situation and the people we were dealing with. It's like we were just reacting on emotions, rather than taking a step back and thinking things through. And now, I'm not sure if we've achieved anything. In fact, I think we might have made things worse.\n\nThe thing is, as long as the Iraqi people are fighting among themselves, they're not going to be a threat to us. So, I don't see how our presence there is making a difference. It's like we're just trying to impose our will on them, but they're not receptive to it. Sometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they're waging war and causing destruction. I don't know, maybe that's just my perception, but it's hard for me to care about what's happening over there right now.\n\nI think we should have just left them alone and let them figure things out for themselves. War is a different beast for them than it is for us. We just can't compare the two. Our goal should have been to get out of there as soon as possible and not try to impose our values on them. We were just looking for revenge, and that's not a solid reason to go to war.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a clear plan. We didn't think about the long-term consequences of our actions, and now we're stuck in a situation that's not going to get better anytime soon. I think we should just cut our losses and get out of there. It's time for us to move on and let the Iraqis deal with their own problems."
