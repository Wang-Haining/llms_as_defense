            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in several ways. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of many things. \n\nFor instance, they have strong views on things like gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, I think they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and some are even disagreeing with them on certain subjects. This makes me feel that the Church has the wrong stance on these matters.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for example, might make it uncomfortable for those who support it to be part of a community that teaches it's completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I also don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's hard to say whether allowing these things would have prevented past issues, but I don't think it would have necessarily made a difference.\n\nThe idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but it's not a reason to deny them a family life or relationships with others. Everyone else in the world has their job and their personal life, and I don't see why priests should be any different. It's a bit puzzling that the Catholic Church can't seem to understand this.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage.  I think people should be able to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives, and if that means marrying someone of the same sex, then so be it.  I don't think it's fair to hold people accountable for their sexual orientation - it's not something they can control, and it's not something they can change.  It's just who they are.\n\nI think it's wrong for society to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.  I mean, if a man and a woman can get married, then why can't two people of the same sex?  It doesn't seem fair or just to deny them the same rights.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's something I've given a lot of thought to, but it seems to me that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can choose.  We're all born with it, and it's a natural part of who we are.  So, I don't think it's right for the government to interfere with people's personal lives and dictate who they can and can't marry.\n\nI think the federal government should leave this issue alone.  It's not a matter of law, and it's not a matter of national security.  It's just a matter of people being able to live their lives as they see fit.  And if that means being in a same-sex relationship, then that's their choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any place in people's personal lives, and I think they should stay out of it.  People should be free to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit, without the government telling them what they can and can't do.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is based on a narrow-minded perspective. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; they're fundamentally different, yet equally valid.\n\nIn reality, same-sex couples face numerous civil rights issues, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're not considered family, so they can't be present when their partner is hospitalized or even visit them. This is illogical, especially considering that many same-sex couples are committed to each other for life.\n\nStudies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. It's essentially the same thing – a committed relationship between two people. The problem lies in the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, then why not marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. Separate but equal is not an acceptable solution. Same-sex couples are not asking for special treatment; they want the same rights and respect as everyone else.\n\nThe argument about adoption and community issues is also flawed. Children of same-sex couples are not inherently damaged or less deserving of love and support. In fact, they're often subjected to bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can have long-term effects.\n\nThe idea that children of same-sex parents are more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation is also unfounded. Parenting skills are the same, regardless of the parents' relationship status. It's about personal choices, not orientation.\n\nThe federal government should take a more proactive role in making gay marriage legal across the country. Instead of passing an amendment that discriminates against a minority group, they should focus on promoting equality and inclusivity.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his personal beliefs, which are influenced by his religious views on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not impose its moral standards on an entire country, especially when it contradicts the values of other groups.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage due to misconceptions about the origins of homosexuality, such as it being a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people listened to research and evidence-based information, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, the world would be a more accepting place.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the hospital pharmacy where I work during the summer. So, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the public, no way, but for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, just because a substance is restricted doesn't mean it's not beneficial. For instance, we use certain controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets in the pharmacy, and they're used because they have benefits. So, if we deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because it's stigmatized, that doesn't make sense to me. We should acknowledge its benefits.\n\nYou know, there are a lot of drugs that are banned, but we still use them because they're helpful. If people can't accept the benefits of marijuana because of its negative image, well, I think that's a problem. We should get rid of the stigma surrounding marijuana and then people might be able to use it responsibly.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really bad impression of marijuana because it's an illegal substance. But it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. If we change people's perception of marijuana and make it seem less scary, they might use it responsibly. At least, that's what I think. \n\nIt's not that simple, though. I think we should introduce it gradually, but not all at once, to avoid abuse. First, we need to get rid of that negative image surrounding marijuana. If we do that, people might be able to use it responsibly. And of course, for medical purposes, that's definitely a good thing.",
            "I think the church is now adapting to the 21st century, but not as strictly as it used to be. Growing up, I was used to going to church every Sunday and dressing up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. My private school friends and I would all attend on the weekends, but now they've introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people tend to dress more casually, even during summer when they come straight from the beach. It's also common to see families running in late, which has made the atmosphere a lot more relaxed. Even at morning masses, people now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from when I used to dress up. One thing that really stands out to me is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, I don't know the politics behind the church, but that's the biggest thing I've noticed. As for the recent accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have pedophilic tendencies, so it's not about the rules regarding marriage. When people choose to become priests, it's their own decision, and some other religions allow them to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married at the same time, maybe they should consider a different faith. I think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics, not upbringing. You can't hide it, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they knew about it in all cases.",
            "To be honest, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that people were still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks and we kind of jumped into Iraq using various pretexts. The Bush administration made a connection between the Iraq war, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell has come out and said he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious breach of trust, an impeachable offense, and a blatant disregard for the Constitution. Since September 11th, it's been clear that the Bush administration has been trying to push its own agenda, disregarding the Constitution in the process.\n\nIt seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and was also looking to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve that goal. I think the war has gone on long enough, but withdrawing now would lead to potential chaos and more deaths, so it's a tough situation.\n\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, attempting to restore order in Iraq. However, I'm not sure this is the right approach, as it could lead to more problems in the long run, including concerns over Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government seems ineffective, and it's clear that the Parliament isn't functioning well, with the Prime Minister lacking control and radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party vying for power.\n\nTo be frank, I don't have any easy solutions to offer, but I do know that the situation is complex and fraught with difficulties.",
            "I mean, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq lately, and I'm not really sure what to make of it. It's weird because it's not even officially declared as a war. I think it was just kind of a retaliatory thing because we believed Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks. But to be honest, I don't really follow the details of the war that closely. It seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, but it's taking forever, and we're also after their oil. But the thing is, it's causing so much tension and unrest. I guess if we stay, we'd have to try to create democracy, but that's a long process, and if we leave, they'll just be mad at us for messing things up. It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, I don't have a strong opinion on the war. I'm not really sure what to think. But I do think it's weird that we're calling it a war when it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a pretty big deal. And I'm not sure if it's worth it to stay over there and try to help them. It feels like we're wasting resources, and it's not like we're making things better. Plus, it's making President Bush look really bad right now.\n\nIt's kind of like what happened with the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless war. I'm worried that we're going to end up with the same situation here. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are people I know who have family members fighting over there. But at the same time, we've kind of ruined their lives by taking over and making things unsafe. It's a complicated issue, and I don't think there's a clear solution.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that the war in Iraq is a really complicated and tricky situation, and I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. It's going to take a long time to figure it out, and it's going to be hard to make everyone happy.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for the government to make it legal or even declare it as legal. In my opinion, this is something that should be left to the churches, given the principle of separation of church and state, which is clearly stated in the constitution. It's a bit puzzling when people try to enforce their power over it, as it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another, it's a worrying sign. For example, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with a few exceptions in areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what the churches can or can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the country. Even though there were plans to make an amendment, I think it would be a misguided move and contradict what's already been established. Moreover, it would be one of the rare cases where an amendment would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government should stay out of this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. I don't see any compelling reason for the amendment, apart from personal views, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've made my point clear.",
            "Well, let's talk about the war in Iraq. From my perspective, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it seemed like a stretch to me. The government used the emotions of the people who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion. I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think it's a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq, which is just heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government and created a power vacuum, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that followed. They claimed to be implementing a democratic government, but it's a complex and long-term process. It's similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, where they attempted to push out Communists and install democracy.\n\nLooking back, the US government should have known that this wouldn't be an easy or straightforward victory. They're fighting against a large number of insurgents, which is difficult when you're not fighting an actual army, but the citizens of the country. I think the government was poorly prepared for the aftermath of the invasion.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government didn't do this, and now we're still in Iraq in 2006, with many American troops dying and still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces. I believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful invasion, but it's a long-term process.\n\nWe should have been more realistic about the challenges of implementing a new form of government. Democracy in our own country was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war. It's not an easy thing to do, and the government made it seem like a relatively easy task.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, and I can understand why people wanted to let George Bush finish what he started. However, we've been there for so long now, and it's hard to abandon the people we've taken over. We've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just leave now?\n\nBut there's also the consideration of the huge number of American casualties and the astronomical cost of continuing this war. Going back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we're making it a democratic nation, why isn't this happening to other countries too? I think the main reason is the oil issue, as well as the control of resources. It's usually about money and power.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is that the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had these weapons, weren't targeted. It seems like the US government isn't being thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making.\n\nAll I can hope for is that this war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. However, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I'm pretty clear where I stand on the issue of gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. I've always been of the opinion that it should be a personal preference, and that people shouldn't be denied rights because of something they can't control. Science has even proven that it's not just a matter of sociology, but also has a significant biological component.\n\nI think it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something that's not within their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal and household issue that should be left alone.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other families - they walk their dogs and live their lives without any complications. But if we let politicians like Bush decide what marriage means and how it should be interpreted, I think it's just ridiculous.\n\nIt's interesting to note that research has shown that there's a chemical factor in the brain that might make someone predisposed to being homosexual. It's not something that's determined by upbringing or environment, like having a certain number of sisters or a particular family dynamic. So, there's a strong biological argument for why gay marriage should be recognized.\n\nOne of the main issues with marriage being a public domain is that it's not something that's private or personal. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it without making a big public spectacle, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it becomes a national news story. I think it's something that should be treated as a private, personal matter, not a public issue.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's essentially a public forum, and once it's out there, it's out there for good. As an R.A., I've personally dealt with this issue before, and it's something that's really worth considering.\n\nWhen you put something online, it can definitely shape people's perceptions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or crime, people will take notice, and it's not just your online friends who will see it. If someone brings it to the attention of school officials, they have to take it seriously, even if it was just a joke. The internet is a public space, and what you post can be seen by anyone.\n\nIt's hard to know what's serious and what's not, as some people might be joking around, while others might be genuinely concerned. I recall a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it, and it turned out that the person's Facebook profile had some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke. \n\nWhen you put something online, you relinquish some control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to what you've shared.\n\nSchool officials should be cautious about friending their students on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook, as it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a tricky situation, and I don't think it's a good idea for teachers to create fake accounts to monitor their students' online activity.\n\nAs an R.A., I personally prefer not to be connected to my residents on social media, as I don't want to know about their personal lives unless they choose to share it with me. That way, I can maintain a professional boundary and focus on supporting them when needed.",
            "Honestly, I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. At the beginning, I thought the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal a long time ago. Now, it's possible we're fighting just to prove our military might, rather than achieving a genuine purpose. I'm also skeptical about the original motivations behind the war, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first few months of the war, and that was a powerful statement in itself. But the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year or more is just ridiculous. It's clear that our purpose has been misinterpreted and distorted over time.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, I believe our reasons have been watered down and misconceived. It seems like we're still fighting just to be at war, rather than seeking a decisive victory or a clear conclusion.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on for far too long. It's high time for the government to fend for themselves. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. We should be focusing on our own internal issues, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. These are pressing problems that deserve our attention and financial investment, not the billions we're spending on a foreign war.\n\nIt's a shame that our own citizens are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer clear. The money we're spending on this war could be better spent addressing our own problems and improving our own lives. I think that's a much more worthy use of our resources.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit confused about something, so let me ask for clarification on this. I think there was a situation where someone found out about something because someone else looked at their information online.\n\nOkay, so I think I get it. If you put stuff on the internet, it's pretty much out there for anyone to see. For example, on Myspace, you have to make yourself a friend with someone before they can see your profile, but even then, you're giving them permission to see it. So, basically, if you put something online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see it.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's actually a good thing that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening. It's tough to balance this, though. On the one hand, we can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, if they're only looking for people who might be doing something wrong, it feels like discrimination.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is. Maybe it depends on the situation and why they were looking at the person's profile in the first place. Were they just randomly browsing or were they looking for something specific?\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a TV show once that was about how easy it is for people to get information about you online and it freaked me out. It's not that I think it's a huge deal, but it's just weird to think that people can get so much information about you so easily.\n\nFor example, I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they've been able to figure out my screen name and IM me. They know what I look like, where I am during the day, who my friends are, and all sorts of other stuff. It's hard to know what to do because I want to be able to communicate with my friends online, but at the same time, I don't want to make it easy for strangers to find out about me.\n\nThis is a tricky issue because you never really know who's looking at what online. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned students from having Myspace accounts, and I'm not sure how they had the right to do that. Is it a privacy issue or was it something else entirely? I'm not really sure.\n\nThat's about all I can think of on this topic.",
            "I was thinking about the Iraq War, and I have to admit, I feel a bit hypocritical even bringing it up. I'm not sure I'm ready to join the crowd of people who claim they were against it from the start. It's just that, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people everywhere, except within the administration, thought it was a bad idea from the beginning.\n\nIf we take a look at recent polls, it's striking - around 75 to 80% of the global population thinks the war was a mistake. Even in Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view. Furthermore, 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that they should be withdrawn within the year. It's hard to ignore these results.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war has been a disaster from the very beginning. It's not just that the situation is complicated; it's the fundamental cultural differences between the US and the Middle Eastern countries that make it almost impossible to resolve. The idea of bringing democracy to an area where it's not naturally accepted is a flawed one.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam was a good guy; no one is. However, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. And that's exactly what happened. I don't see a clear reason for us to stay in Iraq anymore. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard any convincing arguments.\n\nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. But I don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting to note that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective.\n\nIf we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We can at least claim that we're leaving because they wanted us to. And if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the good guys - to some extent. Not that we'll ever be seen as completely good in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though - it's more about the specific field of work. I mean, overall, women seem to face more difficulties because of this concept of a \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite supposed equality, many people struggle to work under a female supervisor. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for so long. In the workplace, women often see opportunities they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them to those positions because it's not common for women to hold upper-management roles. The same thing happens in other fields like fashion or stay-at-home parenting, where men are often stigmatized for choosing to stay home and care for their children.\n\nIt's common for people to look down on stay-at-home dads because society expects men to be the breadwinners. This can be tough on them, especially when they've always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives and helping raise them. Meanwhile, their wives might be the breadwinners, and it's just not socially accepted.\n\nIn the fashion industry, guys are often not taken seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it has to do with the fact that men who are into fashion often don't fit the traditional mold, and people might question their expertise on women's fashion. Depending on the field, there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because it's deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress since the 1800s, but it's happening slowly. Women are rising to higher positions, becoming CEOs, and gaining more acceptance in the business world. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, too, as people realize that maybe the female partner does have the better job or wants to be the breadwinner. Similarly, in the fashion industry, people are starting to understand that guys might be listening to their female friends or wives and still have valuable opinions.\n\nTo promote positive change, we need to showcase the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but we shouldn't push it too hard, or people will resist. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become more accepted, so I'm not sure what else we can do that hasn't already been done. If we move too quickly, people will resist, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from, their education, or even their grammar. For example, a man from a rural area with poor grammar but exceptional intelligence might be looked down upon by others who value better-educated, more polished individuals. It's another example of how discrimination can work across different groups, and I'm not sure what to say about it.",
            "So it seems like they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. What that means is it's no longer a serious crime, but more like a traffic ticket – you get cited, not arrested and charged, which can have some serious repercussions on things like job hunting. \n\nAlthough decriminalizing it takes away some of those harsh penalties, people are still worried about the long-term consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's not as severe. On the other hand, some argue that arresting people for pot possession costs a lot of money – think about all the resources used to catch, book, and court them, not to mention the cost of public defenders and judges. \n\nWhen you consider that many cities are already financially struggling, it's hard to justify the expense. Some places might not want to make that change, even if it frees up funds for more important things like education and social programs. However, in cities where people tend to be more open-minded, it's a different story. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal and open to new ideas, decriminalizing marijuana is seen as a good thing. It can actually bring in more revenue for the city, which can be used for good causes.\n\nIt's not all about making pot freely available, though. There are good reasons to be cautious. If it were fully legal, it could lead to issues like people smoking and driving, which is already a concern. Plus, there's still a stigma around smoking marijuana in many areas. Making it widely available could be awkward for some people.\n\nAs for the comparison between marijuana and alcohol, while both have negative effects, marijuana tends to affect people's lifestyle choices more than their motor skills. However, everyone reacts differently to substances, depending on their personality and ability to practice moderation. It's hard to generalize, but both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of issues.",
            "I think yes because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a good thing. For example, the Catholic Church has been doing things the same way for a long time. While it's great to be connected to the past, it's also essential to be open to change. I believe a lot of Catholics feel they need to attend church every week and adhere to the rules very strictly. However, this sometimes leads to a kind of intolerance towards those who don't follow all the teachings or come from other faiths.\n\nFor instance, when my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, they were refused because my dad was an Episcopalian. This seems hypocritical to me, as the Catholic Church teaches us to love and accept others, but in practice, it doesn't always follow this principle. I think the Catholic Church's rules and practices often conflict. They can be outdated, but the Church still sticks to them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in terms of reducing pedophilic behavior. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship altogether. Allowing priests to be married might not alter their behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to get married would be a solution to the problem of child abuse within the Church. Such behavior is likely to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure this out - I haven't really made up my mind on it yet. It's tough because there's a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means. It's a tricky topic because it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone.\n\nI think this is one of the most challenging issues we're facing today. Considering marriage as a sacrament, the government shouldn't give special treatment or tax breaks just because someone's been baptized. If two people are in a civil union, I believe the government should just recognize it for what it is - two people coming together.\n\nIt's not about whether the marriage is \"sacred\" or whatever; it's about two people being together. The separation of church and state should remain intact. The fact that some people want to restrict gay marriage is just the same as any other civil union - two people getting together.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is completely unnecessary. It's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution. Defining or banning gay marriage just isn't that important, so why should it be a constitutional amendment?\n\nIn my opinion, it's just not worth altering the constitution for. It's as simple as that.",
            "To be honest, I've always had mixed feelings about homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. However, knowing many gay friends has made me think differently about the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't think it's something that should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nLiving in a democratic state means you're part of a community that generally supports a particular stance on issues like gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state where gay marriage is accepted, it's hard to argue with the decision. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have the same opportunities, and that's why I think each state should have the freedom to decide on gay marriage.\n\nI already kind of answered that, but to clarify, I don't think President Bush should have the authority to ban gay marriage nationwide. It's up to individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves, and I don't think the president should impose his views on the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his decision to make. Some things should be left up to individual states, and besides, he'll be out of office soon anyway. If a new president wants to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. Ultimately, it's up to each state to decide what works best for them. They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm making sense, but that's my two cents on the issue.",
            "Honestly, I don't think so. \n\nLet me put it this way... If Myspace is a public platform, it's only logical that what's posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. I mean, if you post something online, you have to consider the possibility that it'll be seen by a wider audience. In this case, the school officials were just doing their job to keep the school a safe environment. \n\nThink about it, if they're lurking on Myspace just to catch students engaging in activities that aren't allowed, that's a different story. But if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, as long as it's done to keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. And that's exactly what school officials were doing - making sure the school is a safe environment. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is secure, especially after things like the Columbine shooting. They were just doing drills and stuff to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nSo, in this case, I think the school officials were just doing their job to make the school a safer place. And if that means monitoring Myspace, then so be it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you post something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the fact that it could be seen by anyone. And once it's online, it's hard to take it back. \n\nI mean, even if you're just joking around with friends, there's a risk that something you say could get back to the wrong people. It's just something to be aware of when you're posting online.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I don't think it was an invasion of privacy. If school officials are monitoring Myspace to keep students safe, then that's their job. And if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, then I think that's perfectly okay.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that my perspective on the war has changed over time. Initially, I was really passionate about it because it was a direct response to the 9/11 attacks, which personally affected me. I thought we should strike back and show the world that we wouldn't tolerate such atrocities. However, as time went on, I started to realize that we didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to a lot of problems. I think we overlooked the fact that the people in that region are complex and deeply entrenched in their own conflicts, and we couldn't just impose our will on them.\n\nTo be frank, I'm not sure I care about what's happening over there anymore. It's like they're fighting among themselves, and we're just getting in the way. I don't think our presence is making a significant difference, and I'm starting to think that we should just leave and let them sort out their own problems. War is a different beast for them than it is for us, and I'm not convinced that they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out.\n\nI think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. We went in without a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve, and it's been a disaster. I'm not convinced that we're making progress, and I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. Eventually, we'll leave, and the situation will collapse. We're doing more harm to ourselves by staying in the conflict than good.\n\nLooking back, I think we were caught up in the hype and didn't think things through. We wanted to respond to 9/11, and President Bush took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. At the time, I understood his motivations, but I think we could have handled it differently. We should have taken the time to develop a clear plan and strategy for rebuilding the country, rather than just rushing in with a bunch of guns and bombs.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think we're in a position to make a significant difference in the region. The people there have their own ways and cultures, and we can't change that. I think we should acknowledge that and just leave them to sort out their own problems. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying in the conflict forever. It's time for us to move on and let them take care of themselves."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in several ways. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of many things. \n\nFor instance, they have strong views on things like gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, I think they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and some are even disagreeing with them on certain subjects. This makes me feel that the Church has the wrong stance on these matters.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for example, might make it uncomfortable for those who support it to be part of a community that teaches it's completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I also don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's hard to say whether allowing these things would have prevented past issues, but I don't think it would have necessarily made a difference.\n\nThe idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but it's not a reason to deny them a family life or relationships with others. Everyone else in the world has their job and their personal life, and I don't see why priests should be any different. It's a bit puzzling that the Catholic Church can't seem to understand this.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage.  I think people should be able to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives, and if that means marrying someone of the same sex, then so be it.  I don't think it's fair to hold people accountable for their sexual orientation - it's not something they can control, and it's not something they can change.  It's just who they are.\n\nI think it's wrong for society to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.  I mean, if a man and a woman can get married, then why can't two people of the same sex?  It doesn't seem fair or just to deny them the same rights.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's something I've given a lot of thought to, but it seems to me that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can choose.  We're all born with it, and it's a natural part of who we are.  So, I don't think it's right for the government to interfere with people's personal lives and dictate who they can and can't marry.\n\nI think the federal government should leave this issue alone.  It's not a matter of law, and it's not a matter of national security.  It's just a matter of people being able to live their lives as they see fit.  And if that means being in a same-sex relationship, then that's their choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any place in people's personal lives, and I think they should stay out of it.  People should be free to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit, without the government telling them what they can and can't do.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is based on a narrow-minded perspective. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; they're fundamentally different, yet equally valid.\n\nIn reality, same-sex couples face numerous civil rights issues, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're not considered family, so they can't be present when their partner is hospitalized or even visit them. This is illogical, especially considering that many same-sex couples are committed to each other for life.\n\nStudies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. It's essentially the same thing – a committed relationship between two people. The problem lies in the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, then why not marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. Separate but equal is not an acceptable solution. Same-sex couples are not asking for special treatment; they want the same rights and respect as everyone else.\n\nThe argument about adoption and community issues is also flawed. Children of same-sex couples are not inherently damaged or less deserving of love and support. In fact, they're often subjected to bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can have long-term effects.\n\nThe idea that children of same-sex parents are more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation is also unfounded. Parenting skills are the same, regardless of the parents' relationship status. It's about personal choices, not orientation.\n\nThe federal government should take a more proactive role in making gay marriage legal across the country. Instead of passing an amendment that discriminates against a minority group, they should focus on promoting equality and inclusivity.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his personal beliefs, which are influenced by his religious views on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not impose its moral standards on an entire country, especially when it contradicts the values of other groups.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage due to misconceptions about the origins of homosexuality, such as it being a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people listened to research and evidence-based information, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, the world would be a more accepting place.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the hospital pharmacy where I work during the summer. So, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the public, no way, but for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, just because a substance is restricted doesn't mean it's not beneficial. For instance, we use certain controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets in the pharmacy, and they're used because they have benefits. So, if we deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because it's stigmatized, that doesn't make sense to me. We should acknowledge its benefits.\n\nYou know, there are a lot of drugs that are banned, but we still use them because they're helpful. If people can't accept the benefits of marijuana because of its negative image, well, I think that's a problem. We should get rid of the stigma surrounding marijuana and then people might be able to use it responsibly.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really bad impression of marijuana because it's an illegal substance. But it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. If we change people's perception of marijuana and make it seem less scary, they might use it responsibly. At least, that's what I think. \n\nIt's not that simple, though. I think we should introduce it gradually, but not all at once, to avoid abuse. First, we need to get rid of that negative image surrounding marijuana. If we do that, people might be able to use it responsibly. And of course, for medical purposes, that's definitely a good thing.",
            "I think the church is now adapting to the 21st century, but not as strictly as it used to be. Growing up, I was used to going to church every Sunday and dressing up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. My private school friends and I would all attend on the weekends, but now they've introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people tend to dress more casually, even during summer when they come straight from the beach. It's also common to see families running in late, which has made the atmosphere a lot more relaxed. Even at morning masses, people now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from when I used to dress up. One thing that really stands out to me is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, I don't know the politics behind the church, but that's the biggest thing I've noticed. As for the recent accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have pedophilic tendencies, so it's not about the rules regarding marriage. When people choose to become priests, it's their own decision, and some other religions allow them to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married at the same time, maybe they should consider a different faith. I think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics, not upbringing. You can't hide it, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they knew about it in all cases.",
            "To be honest, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that people were still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks and we kind of jumped into Iraq using various pretexts. The Bush administration made a connection between the Iraq war, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell has come out and said he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious breach of trust, an impeachable offense, and a blatant disregard for the Constitution. Since September 11th, it's been clear that the Bush administration has been trying to push its own agenda, disregarding the Constitution in the process.\n\nIt seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and was also looking to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve that goal. I think the war has gone on long enough, but withdrawing now would lead to potential chaos and more deaths, so it's a tough situation.\n\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, attempting to restore order in Iraq. However, I'm not sure this is the right approach, as it could lead to more problems in the long run, including concerns over Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government seems ineffective, and it's clear that the Parliament isn't functioning well, with the Prime Minister lacking control and radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party vying for power.\n\nTo be frank, I don't have any easy solutions to offer, but I do know that the situation is complex and fraught with difficulties.",
            "I mean, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq lately, and I'm not really sure what to make of it. It's weird because it's not even officially declared as a war. I think it was just kind of a retaliatory thing because we believed Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks. But to be honest, I don't really follow the details of the war that closely. It seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, but it's taking forever, and we're also after their oil. But the thing is, it's causing so much tension and unrest. I guess if we stay, we'd have to try to create democracy, but that's a long process, and if we leave, they'll just be mad at us for messing things up. It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, I don't have a strong opinion on the war. I'm not really sure what to think. But I do think it's weird that we're calling it a war when it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a pretty big deal. And I'm not sure if it's worth it to stay over there and try to help them. It feels like we're wasting resources, and it's not like we're making things better. Plus, it's making President Bush look really bad right now.\n\nIt's kind of like what happened with the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless war. I'm worried that we're going to end up with the same situation here. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are people I know who have family members fighting over there. But at the same time, we've kind of ruined their lives by taking over and making things unsafe. It's a complicated issue, and I don't think there's a clear solution.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that the war in Iraq is a really complicated and tricky situation, and I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. It's going to take a long time to figure it out, and it's going to be hard to make everyone happy.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for the government to make it legal or even declare it as legal. In my opinion, this is something that should be left to the churches, given the principle of separation of church and state, which is clearly stated in the constitution. It's a bit puzzling when people try to enforce their power over it, as it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another, it's a worrying sign. For example, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with a few exceptions in areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what the churches can or can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the country. Even though there were plans to make an amendment, I think it would be a misguided move and contradict what's already been established. Moreover, it would be one of the rare cases where an amendment would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government should stay out of this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. I don't see any compelling reason for the amendment, apart from personal views, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've made my point clear.",
            "Well, let's talk about the war in Iraq. From my perspective, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it seemed like a stretch to me. The government used the emotions of the people who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion. I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think it's a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq, which is just heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government and created a power vacuum, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that followed. They claimed to be implementing a democratic government, but it's a complex and long-term process. It's similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, where they attempted to push out Communists and install democracy.\n\nLooking back, the US government should have known that this wouldn't be an easy or straightforward victory. They're fighting against a large number of insurgents, which is difficult when you're not fighting an actual army, but the citizens of the country. I think the government was poorly prepared for the aftermath of the invasion.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government didn't do this, and now we're still in Iraq in 2006, with many American troops dying and still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces. I believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful invasion, but it's a long-term process.\n\nWe should have been more realistic about the challenges of implementing a new form of government. Democracy in our own country was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war. It's not an easy thing to do, and the government made it seem like a relatively easy task.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, and I can understand why people wanted to let George Bush finish what he started. However, we've been there for so long now, and it's hard to abandon the people we've taken over. We've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just leave now?\n\nBut there's also the consideration of the huge number of American casualties and the astronomical cost of continuing this war. Going back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we're making it a democratic nation, why isn't this happening to other countries too? I think the main reason is the oil issue, as well as the control of resources. It's usually about money and power.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is that the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had these weapons, weren't targeted. It seems like the US government isn't being thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making.\n\nAll I can hope for is that this war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. However, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I'm pretty clear where I stand on the issue of gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. I've always been of the opinion that it should be a personal preference, and that people shouldn't be denied rights because of something they can't control. Science has even proven that it's not just a matter of sociology, but also has a significant biological component.\n\nI think it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something that's not within their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal and household issue that should be left alone.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other families - they walk their dogs and live their lives without any complications. But if we let politicians like Bush decide what marriage means and how it should be interpreted, I think it's just ridiculous.\n\nIt's interesting to note that research has shown that there's a chemical factor in the brain that might make someone predisposed to being homosexual. It's not something that's determined by upbringing or environment, like having a certain number of sisters or a particular family dynamic. So, there's a strong biological argument for why gay marriage should be recognized.\n\nOne of the main issues with marriage being a public domain is that it's not something that's private or personal. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it without making a big public spectacle, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it becomes a national news story. I think it's something that should be treated as a private, personal matter, not a public issue.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's essentially a public forum, and once it's out there, it's out there for good. As an R.A., I've personally dealt with this issue before, and it's something that's really worth considering.\n\nWhen you put something online, it can definitely shape people's perceptions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or crime, people will take notice, and it's not just your online friends who will see it. If someone brings it to the attention of school officials, they have to take it seriously, even if it was just a joke. The internet is a public space, and what you post can be seen by anyone.\n\nIt's hard to know what's serious and what's not, as some people might be joking around, while others might be genuinely concerned. I recall a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it, and it turned out that the person's Facebook profile had some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke. \n\nWhen you put something online, you relinquish some control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to what you've shared.\n\nSchool officials should be cautious about friending their students on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook, as it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a tricky situation, and I don't think it's a good idea for teachers to create fake accounts to monitor their students' online activity.\n\nAs an R.A., I personally prefer not to be connected to my residents on social media, as I don't want to know about their personal lives unless they choose to share it with me. That way, I can maintain a professional boundary and focus on supporting them when needed.",
            "Honestly, I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. At the beginning, I thought the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal a long time ago. Now, it's possible we're fighting just to prove our military might, rather than achieving a genuine purpose. I'm also skeptical about the original motivations behind the war, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first few months of the war, and that was a powerful statement in itself. But the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year or more is just ridiculous. It's clear that our purpose has been misinterpreted and distorted over time.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, I believe our reasons have been watered down and misconceived. It seems like we're still fighting just to be at war, rather than seeking a decisive victory or a clear conclusion.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on for far too long. It's high time for the government to fend for themselves. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. We should be focusing on our own internal issues, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. These are pressing problems that deserve our attention and financial investment, not the billions we're spending on a foreign war.\n\nIt's a shame that our own citizens are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer clear. The money we're spending on this war could be better spent addressing our own problems and improving our own lives. I think that's a much more worthy use of our resources.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit confused about something, so let me ask for clarification on this. I think there was a situation where someone found out about something because someone else looked at their information online.\n\nOkay, so I think I get it. If you put stuff on the internet, it's pretty much out there for anyone to see. For example, on Myspace, you have to make yourself a friend with someone before they can see your profile, but even then, you're giving them permission to see it. So, basically, if you put something online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see it.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's actually a good thing that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening. It's tough to balance this, though. On the one hand, we can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, if they're only looking for people who might be doing something wrong, it feels like discrimination.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is. Maybe it depends on the situation and why they were looking at the person's profile in the first place. Were they just randomly browsing or were they looking for something specific?\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a TV show once that was about how easy it is for people to get information about you online and it freaked me out. It's not that I think it's a huge deal, but it's just weird to think that people can get so much information about you so easily.\n\nFor example, I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they've been able to figure out my screen name and IM me. They know what I look like, where I am during the day, who my friends are, and all sorts of other stuff. It's hard to know what to do because I want to be able to communicate with my friends online, but at the same time, I don't want to make it easy for strangers to find out about me.\n\nThis is a tricky issue because you never really know who's looking at what online. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned students from having Myspace accounts, and I'm not sure how they had the right to do that. Is it a privacy issue or was it something else entirely? I'm not really sure.\n\nThat's about all I can think of on this topic.",
            "I was thinking about the Iraq War, and I have to admit, I feel a bit hypocritical even bringing it up. I'm not sure I'm ready to join the crowd of people who claim they were against it from the start. It's just that, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people everywhere, except within the administration, thought it was a bad idea from the beginning.\n\nIf we take a look at recent polls, it's striking - around 75 to 80% of the global population thinks the war was a mistake. Even in Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view. Furthermore, 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that they should be withdrawn within the year. It's hard to ignore these results.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war has been a disaster from the very beginning. It's not just that the situation is complicated; it's the fundamental cultural differences between the US and the Middle Eastern countries that make it almost impossible to resolve. The idea of bringing democracy to an area where it's not naturally accepted is a flawed one.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam was a good guy; no one is. However, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. And that's exactly what happened. I don't see a clear reason for us to stay in Iraq anymore. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard any convincing arguments.\n\nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. But I don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting to note that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective.\n\nIf we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We can at least claim that we're leaving because they wanted us to. And if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the good guys - to some extent. Not that we'll ever be seen as completely good in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though - it's more about the specific field of work. I mean, overall, women seem to face more difficulties because of this concept of a \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite supposed equality, many people struggle to work under a female supervisor. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for so long. In the workplace, women often see opportunities they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them to those positions because it's not common for women to hold upper-management roles. The same thing happens in other fields like fashion or stay-at-home parenting, where men are often stigmatized for choosing to stay home and care for their children.\n\nIt's common for people to look down on stay-at-home dads because society expects men to be the breadwinners. This can be tough on them, especially when they've always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives and helping raise them. Meanwhile, their wives might be the breadwinners, and it's just not socially accepted.\n\nIn the fashion industry, guys are often not taken seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it has to do with the fact that men who are into fashion often don't fit the traditional mold, and people might question their expertise on women's fashion. Depending on the field, there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because it's deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress since the 1800s, but it's happening slowly. Women are rising to higher positions, becoming CEOs, and gaining more acceptance in the business world. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, too, as people realize that maybe the female partner does have the better job or wants to be the breadwinner. Similarly, in the fashion industry, people are starting to understand that guys might be listening to their female friends or wives and still have valuable opinions.\n\nTo promote positive change, we need to showcase the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but we shouldn't push it too hard, or people will resist. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become more accepted, so I'm not sure what else we can do that hasn't already been done. If we move too quickly, people will resist, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from, their education, or even their grammar. For example, a man from a rural area with poor grammar but exceptional intelligence might be looked down upon by others who value better-educated, more polished individuals. It's another example of how discrimination can work across different groups, and I'm not sure what to say about it.",
            "So it seems like they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. What that means is it's no longer a serious crime, but more like a traffic ticket – you get cited, not arrested and charged, which can have some serious repercussions on things like job hunting. \n\nAlthough decriminalizing it takes away some of those harsh penalties, people are still worried about the long-term consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's not as severe. On the other hand, some argue that arresting people for pot possession costs a lot of money – think about all the resources used to catch, book, and court them, not to mention the cost of public defenders and judges. \n\nWhen you consider that many cities are already financially struggling, it's hard to justify the expense. Some places might not want to make that change, even if it frees up funds for more important things like education and social programs. However, in cities where people tend to be more open-minded, it's a different story. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal and open to new ideas, decriminalizing marijuana is seen as a good thing. It can actually bring in more revenue for the city, which can be used for good causes.\n\nIt's not all about making pot freely available, though. There are good reasons to be cautious. If it were fully legal, it could lead to issues like people smoking and driving, which is already a concern. Plus, there's still a stigma around smoking marijuana in many areas. Making it widely available could be awkward for some people.\n\nAs for the comparison between marijuana and alcohol, while both have negative effects, marijuana tends to affect people's lifestyle choices more than their motor skills. However, everyone reacts differently to substances, depending on their personality and ability to practice moderation. It's hard to generalize, but both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of issues.",
            "I think yes because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a good thing. For example, the Catholic Church has been doing things the same way for a long time. While it's great to be connected to the past, it's also essential to be open to change. I believe a lot of Catholics feel they need to attend church every week and adhere to the rules very strictly. However, this sometimes leads to a kind of intolerance towards those who don't follow all the teachings or come from other faiths.\n\nFor instance, when my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, they were refused because my dad was an Episcopalian. This seems hypocritical to me, as the Catholic Church teaches us to love and accept others, but in practice, it doesn't always follow this principle. I think the Catholic Church's rules and practices often conflict. They can be outdated, but the Church still sticks to them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in terms of reducing pedophilic behavior. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship altogether. Allowing priests to be married might not alter their behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to get married would be a solution to the problem of child abuse within the Church. Such behavior is likely to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure this out - I haven't really made up my mind on it yet. It's tough because there's a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means. It's a tricky topic because it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone.\n\nI think this is one of the most challenging issues we're facing today. Considering marriage as a sacrament, the government shouldn't give special treatment or tax breaks just because someone's been baptized. If two people are in a civil union, I believe the government should just recognize it for what it is - two people coming together.\n\nIt's not about whether the marriage is \"sacred\" or whatever; it's about two people being together. The separation of church and state should remain intact. The fact that some people want to restrict gay marriage is just the same as any other civil union - two people getting together.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is completely unnecessary. It's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution. Defining or banning gay marriage just isn't that important, so why should it be a constitutional amendment?\n\nIn my opinion, it's just not worth altering the constitution for. It's as simple as that.",
            "To be honest, I've always had mixed feelings about homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. However, knowing many gay friends has made me think differently about the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't think it's something that should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nLiving in a democratic state means you're part of a community that generally supports a particular stance on issues like gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state where gay marriage is accepted, it's hard to argue with the decision. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have the same opportunities, and that's why I think each state should have the freedom to decide on gay marriage.\n\nI already kind of answered that, but to clarify, I don't think President Bush should have the authority to ban gay marriage nationwide. It's up to individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves, and I don't think the president should impose his views on the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his decision to make. Some things should be left up to individual states, and besides, he'll be out of office soon anyway. If a new president wants to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. Ultimately, it's up to each state to decide what works best for them. They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm making sense, but that's my two cents on the issue.",
            "Honestly, I don't think so. \n\nLet me put it this way... If Myspace is a public platform, it's only logical that what's posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. I mean, if you post something online, you have to consider the possibility that it'll be seen by a wider audience. In this case, the school officials were just doing their job to keep the school a safe environment. \n\nThink about it, if they're lurking on Myspace just to catch students engaging in activities that aren't allowed, that's a different story. But if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, as long as it's done to keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. And that's exactly what school officials were doing - making sure the school is a safe environment. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is secure, especially after things like the Columbine shooting. They were just doing drills and stuff to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nSo, in this case, I think the school officials were just doing their job to make the school a safer place. And if that means monitoring Myspace, then so be it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you post something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the fact that it could be seen by anyone. And once it's online, it's hard to take it back. \n\nI mean, even if you're just joking around with friends, there's a risk that something you say could get back to the wrong people. It's just something to be aware of when you're posting online.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I don't think it was an invasion of privacy. If school officials are monitoring Myspace to keep students safe, then that's their job. And if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, then I think that's perfectly okay.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that my perspective on the war has changed over time. Initially, I was really passionate about it because it was a direct response to the 9/11 attacks, which personally affected me. I thought we should strike back and show the world that we wouldn't tolerate such atrocities. However, as time went on, I started to realize that we didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to a lot of problems. I think we overlooked the fact that the people in that region are complex and deeply entrenched in their own conflicts, and we couldn't just impose our will on them.\n\nTo be frank, I'm not sure I care about what's happening over there anymore. It's like they're fighting among themselves, and we're just getting in the way. I don't think our presence is making a significant difference, and I'm starting to think that we should just leave and let them sort out their own problems. War is a different beast for them than it is for us, and I'm not convinced that they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out.\n\nI think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. We went in without a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve, and it's been a disaster. I'm not convinced that we're making progress, and I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. Eventually, we'll leave, and the situation will collapse. We're doing more harm to ourselves by staying in the conflict than good.\n\nLooking back, I think we were caught up in the hype and didn't think things through. We wanted to respond to 9/11, and President Bush took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. At the time, I understood his motivations, but I think we could have handled it differently. We should have taken the time to develop a clear plan and strategy for rebuilding the country, rather than just rushing in with a bunch of guns and bombs.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think we're in a position to make a significant difference in the region. The people there have their own ways and cultures, and we can't change that. I think we should acknowledge that and just leave them to sort out their own problems. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying in the conflict forever. It's time for us to move on and let them take care of themselves."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in several ways. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of many things. \n\nFor instance, they have strong views on things like gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, I think they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and some are even disagreeing with them on certain subjects. This makes me feel that the Church has the wrong stance on these matters.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for example, might make it uncomfortable for those who support it to be part of a community that teaches it's completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I also don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's hard to say whether allowing these things would have prevented past issues, but I don't think it would have necessarily made a difference.\n\nThe idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but it's not a reason to deny them a family life or relationships with others. Everyone else in the world has their job and their personal life, and I don't see why priests should be any different. It's a bit puzzling that the Catholic Church can't seem to understand this.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage.  I think people should be able to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives, and if that means marrying someone of the same sex, then so be it.  I don't think it's fair to hold people accountable for their sexual orientation - it's not something they can control, and it's not something they can change.  It's just who they are.\n\nI think it's wrong for society to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.  I mean, if a man and a woman can get married, then why can't two people of the same sex?  It doesn't seem fair or just to deny them the same rights.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's something I've given a lot of thought to, but it seems to me that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can choose.  We're all born with it, and it's a natural part of who we are.  So, I don't think it's right for the government to interfere with people's personal lives and dictate who they can and can't marry.\n\nI think the federal government should leave this issue alone.  It's not a matter of law, and it's not a matter of national security.  It's just a matter of people being able to live their lives as they see fit.  And if that means being in a same-sex relationship, then that's their choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any place in people's personal lives, and I think they should stay out of it.  People should be free to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit, without the government telling them what they can and can't do.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is based on a narrow-minded perspective. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; they're fundamentally different, yet equally valid.\n\nIn reality, same-sex couples face numerous civil rights issues, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're not considered family, so they can't be present when their partner is hospitalized or even visit them. This is illogical, especially considering that many same-sex couples are committed to each other for life.\n\nStudies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. It's essentially the same thing – a committed relationship between two people. The problem lies in the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, then why not marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. Separate but equal is not an acceptable solution. Same-sex couples are not asking for special treatment; they want the same rights and respect as everyone else.\n\nThe argument about adoption and community issues is also flawed. Children of same-sex couples are not inherently damaged or less deserving of love and support. In fact, they're often subjected to bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can have long-term effects.\n\nThe idea that children of same-sex parents are more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation is also unfounded. Parenting skills are the same, regardless of the parents' relationship status. It's about personal choices, not orientation.\n\nThe federal government should take a more proactive role in making gay marriage legal across the country. Instead of passing an amendment that discriminates against a minority group, they should focus on promoting equality and inclusivity.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his personal beliefs, which are influenced by his religious views on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not impose its moral standards on an entire country, especially when it contradicts the values of other groups.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage due to misconceptions about the origins of homosexuality, such as it being a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people listened to research and evidence-based information, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, the world would be a more accepting place.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the hospital pharmacy where I work during the summer. So, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the public, no way, but for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, just because a substance is restricted doesn't mean it's not beneficial. For instance, we use certain controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets in the pharmacy, and they're used because they have benefits. So, if we deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because it's stigmatized, that doesn't make sense to me. We should acknowledge its benefits.\n\nYou know, there are a lot of drugs that are banned, but we still use them because they're helpful. If people can't accept the benefits of marijuana because of its negative image, well, I think that's a problem. We should get rid of the stigma surrounding marijuana and then people might be able to use it responsibly.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really bad impression of marijuana because it's an illegal substance. But it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. If we change people's perception of marijuana and make it seem less scary, they might use it responsibly. At least, that's what I think. \n\nIt's not that simple, though. I think we should introduce it gradually, but not all at once, to avoid abuse. First, we need to get rid of that negative image surrounding marijuana. If we do that, people might be able to use it responsibly. And of course, for medical purposes, that's definitely a good thing.",
            "I think the church is now adapting to the 21st century, but not as strictly as it used to be. Growing up, I was used to going to church every Sunday and dressing up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. My private school friends and I would all attend on the weekends, but now they've introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people tend to dress more casually, even during summer when they come straight from the beach. It's also common to see families running in late, which has made the atmosphere a lot more relaxed. Even at morning masses, people now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from when I used to dress up. One thing that really stands out to me is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, I don't know the politics behind the church, but that's the biggest thing I've noticed. As for the recent accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have pedophilic tendencies, so it's not about the rules regarding marriage. When people choose to become priests, it's their own decision, and some other religions allow them to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married at the same time, maybe they should consider a different faith. I think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics, not upbringing. You can't hide it, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they knew about it in all cases.",
            "To be honest, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that people were still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks and we kind of jumped into Iraq using various pretexts. The Bush administration made a connection between the Iraq war, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell has come out and said he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious breach of trust, an impeachable offense, and a blatant disregard for the Constitution. Since September 11th, it's been clear that the Bush administration has been trying to push its own agenda, disregarding the Constitution in the process.\n\nIt seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and was also looking to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve that goal. I think the war has gone on long enough, but withdrawing now would lead to potential chaos and more deaths, so it's a tough situation.\n\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, attempting to restore order in Iraq. However, I'm not sure this is the right approach, as it could lead to more problems in the long run, including concerns over Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government seems ineffective, and it's clear that the Parliament isn't functioning well, with the Prime Minister lacking control and radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party vying for power.\n\nTo be frank, I don't have any easy solutions to offer, but I do know that the situation is complex and fraught with difficulties.",
            "I mean, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq lately, and I'm not really sure what to make of it. It's weird because it's not even officially declared as a war. I think it was just kind of a retaliatory thing because we believed Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks. But to be honest, I don't really follow the details of the war that closely. It seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, but it's taking forever, and we're also after their oil. But the thing is, it's causing so much tension and unrest. I guess if we stay, we'd have to try to create democracy, but that's a long process, and if we leave, they'll just be mad at us for messing things up. It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, I don't have a strong opinion on the war. I'm not really sure what to think. But I do think it's weird that we're calling it a war when it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a pretty big deal. And I'm not sure if it's worth it to stay over there and try to help them. It feels like we're wasting resources, and it's not like we're making things better. Plus, it's making President Bush look really bad right now.\n\nIt's kind of like what happened with the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless war. I'm worried that we're going to end up with the same situation here. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are people I know who have family members fighting over there. But at the same time, we've kind of ruined their lives by taking over and making things unsafe. It's a complicated issue, and I don't think there's a clear solution.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that the war in Iraq is a really complicated and tricky situation, and I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. It's going to take a long time to figure it out, and it's going to be hard to make everyone happy.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for the government to make it legal or even declare it as legal. In my opinion, this is something that should be left to the churches, given the principle of separation of church and state, which is clearly stated in the constitution. It's a bit puzzling when people try to enforce their power over it, as it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another, it's a worrying sign. For example, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with a few exceptions in areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what the churches can or can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the country. Even though there were plans to make an amendment, I think it would be a misguided move and contradict what's already been established. Moreover, it would be one of the rare cases where an amendment would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government should stay out of this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. I don't see any compelling reason for the amendment, apart from personal views, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've made my point clear.",
            "Well, let's talk about the war in Iraq. From my perspective, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it seemed like a stretch to me. The government used the emotions of the people who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion. I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think it's a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq, which is just heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government and created a power vacuum, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that followed. They claimed to be implementing a democratic government, but it's a complex and long-term process. It's similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, where they attempted to push out Communists and install democracy.\n\nLooking back, the US government should have known that this wouldn't be an easy or straightforward victory. They're fighting against a large number of insurgents, which is difficult when you're not fighting an actual army, but the citizens of the country. I think the government was poorly prepared for the aftermath of the invasion.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government didn't do this, and now we're still in Iraq in 2006, with many American troops dying and still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces. I believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful invasion, but it's a long-term process.\n\nWe should have been more realistic about the challenges of implementing a new form of government. Democracy in our own country was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war. It's not an easy thing to do, and the government made it seem like a relatively easy task.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, and I can understand why people wanted to let George Bush finish what he started. However, we've been there for so long now, and it's hard to abandon the people we've taken over. We've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just leave now?\n\nBut there's also the consideration of the huge number of American casualties and the astronomical cost of continuing this war. Going back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we're making it a democratic nation, why isn't this happening to other countries too? I think the main reason is the oil issue, as well as the control of resources. It's usually about money and power.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is that the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had these weapons, weren't targeted. It seems like the US government isn't being thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making.\n\nAll I can hope for is that this war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. However, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I'm pretty clear where I stand on the issue of gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. I've always been of the opinion that it should be a personal preference, and that people shouldn't be denied rights because of something they can't control. Science has even proven that it's not just a matter of sociology, but also has a significant biological component.\n\nI think it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something that's not within their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal and household issue that should be left alone.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other families - they walk their dogs and live their lives without any complications. But if we let politicians like Bush decide what marriage means and how it should be interpreted, I think it's just ridiculous.\n\nIt's interesting to note that research has shown that there's a chemical factor in the brain that might make someone predisposed to being homosexual. It's not something that's determined by upbringing or environment, like having a certain number of sisters or a particular family dynamic. So, there's a strong biological argument for why gay marriage should be recognized.\n\nOne of the main issues with marriage being a public domain is that it's not something that's private or personal. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it without making a big public spectacle, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it becomes a national news story. I think it's something that should be treated as a private, personal matter, not a public issue.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's essentially a public forum, and once it's out there, it's out there for good. As an R.A., I've personally dealt with this issue before, and it's something that's really worth considering.\n\nWhen you put something online, it can definitely shape people's perceptions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or crime, people will take notice, and it's not just your online friends who will see it. If someone brings it to the attention of school officials, they have to take it seriously, even if it was just a joke. The internet is a public space, and what you post can be seen by anyone.\n\nIt's hard to know what's serious and what's not, as some people might be joking around, while others might be genuinely concerned. I recall a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it, and it turned out that the person's Facebook profile had some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke. \n\nWhen you put something online, you relinquish some control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to what you've shared.\n\nSchool officials should be cautious about friending their students on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook, as it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a tricky situation, and I don't think it's a good idea for teachers to create fake accounts to monitor their students' online activity.\n\nAs an R.A., I personally prefer not to be connected to my residents on social media, as I don't want to know about their personal lives unless they choose to share it with me. That way, I can maintain a professional boundary and focus on supporting them when needed.",
            "Honestly, I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. At the beginning, I thought the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal a long time ago. Now, it's possible we're fighting just to prove our military might, rather than achieving a genuine purpose. I'm also skeptical about the original motivations behind the war, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first few months of the war, and that was a powerful statement in itself. But the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year or more is just ridiculous. It's clear that our purpose has been misinterpreted and distorted over time.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, I believe our reasons have been watered down and misconceived. It seems like we're still fighting just to be at war, rather than seeking a decisive victory or a clear conclusion.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on for far too long. It's high time for the government to fend for themselves. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. We should be focusing on our own internal issues, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. These are pressing problems that deserve our attention and financial investment, not the billions we're spending on a foreign war.\n\nIt's a shame that our own citizens are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer clear. The money we're spending on this war could be better spent addressing our own problems and improving our own lives. I think that's a much more worthy use of our resources.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit confused about something, so let me ask for clarification on this. I think there was a situation where someone found out about something because someone else looked at their information online.\n\nOkay, so I think I get it. If you put stuff on the internet, it's pretty much out there for anyone to see. For example, on Myspace, you have to make yourself a friend with someone before they can see your profile, but even then, you're giving them permission to see it. So, basically, if you put something online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see it.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's actually a good thing that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening. It's tough to balance this, though. On the one hand, we can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, if they're only looking for people who might be doing something wrong, it feels like discrimination.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is. Maybe it depends on the situation and why they were looking at the person's profile in the first place. Were they just randomly browsing or were they looking for something specific?\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a TV show once that was about how easy it is for people to get information about you online and it freaked me out. It's not that I think it's a huge deal, but it's just weird to think that people can get so much information about you so easily.\n\nFor example, I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they've been able to figure out my screen name and IM me. They know what I look like, where I am during the day, who my friends are, and all sorts of other stuff. It's hard to know what to do because I want to be able to communicate with my friends online, but at the same time, I don't want to make it easy for strangers to find out about me.\n\nThis is a tricky issue because you never really know who's looking at what online. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned students from having Myspace accounts, and I'm not sure how they had the right to do that. Is it a privacy issue or was it something else entirely? I'm not really sure.\n\nThat's about all I can think of on this topic.",
            "I was thinking about the Iraq War, and I have to admit, I feel a bit hypocritical even bringing it up. I'm not sure I'm ready to join the crowd of people who claim they were against it from the start. It's just that, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people everywhere, except within the administration, thought it was a bad idea from the beginning.\n\nIf we take a look at recent polls, it's striking - around 75 to 80% of the global population thinks the war was a mistake. Even in Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view. Furthermore, 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that they should be withdrawn within the year. It's hard to ignore these results.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war has been a disaster from the very beginning. It's not just that the situation is complicated; it's the fundamental cultural differences between the US and the Middle Eastern countries that make it almost impossible to resolve. The idea of bringing democracy to an area where it's not naturally accepted is a flawed one.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam was a good guy; no one is. However, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. And that's exactly what happened. I don't see a clear reason for us to stay in Iraq anymore. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard any convincing arguments.\n\nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. But I don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting to note that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective.\n\nIf we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We can at least claim that we're leaving because they wanted us to. And if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the good guys - to some extent. Not that we'll ever be seen as completely good in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though - it's more about the specific field of work. I mean, overall, women seem to face more difficulties because of this concept of a \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite supposed equality, many people struggle to work under a female supervisor. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for so long. In the workplace, women often see opportunities they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them to those positions because it's not common for women to hold upper-management roles. The same thing happens in other fields like fashion or stay-at-home parenting, where men are often stigmatized for choosing to stay home and care for their children.\n\nIt's common for people to look down on stay-at-home dads because society expects men to be the breadwinners. This can be tough on them, especially when they've always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives and helping raise them. Meanwhile, their wives might be the breadwinners, and it's just not socially accepted.\n\nIn the fashion industry, guys are often not taken seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it has to do with the fact that men who are into fashion often don't fit the traditional mold, and people might question their expertise on women's fashion. Depending on the field, there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because it's deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress since the 1800s, but it's happening slowly. Women are rising to higher positions, becoming CEOs, and gaining more acceptance in the business world. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, too, as people realize that maybe the female partner does have the better job or wants to be the breadwinner. Similarly, in the fashion industry, people are starting to understand that guys might be listening to their female friends or wives and still have valuable opinions.\n\nTo promote positive change, we need to showcase the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but we shouldn't push it too hard, or people will resist. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become more accepted, so I'm not sure what else we can do that hasn't already been done. If we move too quickly, people will resist, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from, their education, or even their grammar. For example, a man from a rural area with poor grammar but exceptional intelligence might be looked down upon by others who value better-educated, more polished individuals. It's another example of how discrimination can work across different groups, and I'm not sure what to say about it.",
            "So it seems like they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. What that means is it's no longer a serious crime, but more like a traffic ticket – you get cited, not arrested and charged, which can have some serious repercussions on things like job hunting. \n\nAlthough decriminalizing it takes away some of those harsh penalties, people are still worried about the long-term consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's not as severe. On the other hand, some argue that arresting people for pot possession costs a lot of money – think about all the resources used to catch, book, and court them, not to mention the cost of public defenders and judges. \n\nWhen you consider that many cities are already financially struggling, it's hard to justify the expense. Some places might not want to make that change, even if it frees up funds for more important things like education and social programs. However, in cities where people tend to be more open-minded, it's a different story. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal and open to new ideas, decriminalizing marijuana is seen as a good thing. It can actually bring in more revenue for the city, which can be used for good causes.\n\nIt's not all about making pot freely available, though. There are good reasons to be cautious. If it were fully legal, it could lead to issues like people smoking and driving, which is already a concern. Plus, there's still a stigma around smoking marijuana in many areas. Making it widely available could be awkward for some people.\n\nAs for the comparison between marijuana and alcohol, while both have negative effects, marijuana tends to affect people's lifestyle choices more than their motor skills. However, everyone reacts differently to substances, depending on their personality and ability to practice moderation. It's hard to generalize, but both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of issues.",
            "I think yes because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a good thing. For example, the Catholic Church has been doing things the same way for a long time. While it's great to be connected to the past, it's also essential to be open to change. I believe a lot of Catholics feel they need to attend church every week and adhere to the rules very strictly. However, this sometimes leads to a kind of intolerance towards those who don't follow all the teachings or come from other faiths.\n\nFor instance, when my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, they were refused because my dad was an Episcopalian. This seems hypocritical to me, as the Catholic Church teaches us to love and accept others, but in practice, it doesn't always follow this principle. I think the Catholic Church's rules and practices often conflict. They can be outdated, but the Church still sticks to them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in terms of reducing pedophilic behavior. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship altogether. Allowing priests to be married might not alter their behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to get married would be a solution to the problem of child abuse within the Church. Such behavior is likely to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure this out - I haven't really made up my mind on it yet. It's tough because there's a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means. It's a tricky topic because it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone.\n\nI think this is one of the most challenging issues we're facing today. Considering marriage as a sacrament, the government shouldn't give special treatment or tax breaks just because someone's been baptized. If two people are in a civil union, I believe the government should just recognize it for what it is - two people coming together.\n\nIt's not about whether the marriage is \"sacred\" or whatever; it's about two people being together. The separation of church and state should remain intact. The fact that some people want to restrict gay marriage is just the same as any other civil union - two people getting together.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is completely unnecessary. It's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution. Defining or banning gay marriage just isn't that important, so why should it be a constitutional amendment?\n\nIn my opinion, it's just not worth altering the constitution for. It's as simple as that.",
            "To be honest, I've always had mixed feelings about homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. However, knowing many gay friends has made me think differently about the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't think it's something that should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nLiving in a democratic state means you're part of a community that generally supports a particular stance on issues like gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state where gay marriage is accepted, it's hard to argue with the decision. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have the same opportunities, and that's why I think each state should have the freedom to decide on gay marriage.\n\nI already kind of answered that, but to clarify, I don't think President Bush should have the authority to ban gay marriage nationwide. It's up to individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves, and I don't think the president should impose his views on the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his decision to make. Some things should be left up to individual states, and besides, he'll be out of office soon anyway. If a new president wants to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. Ultimately, it's up to each state to decide what works best for them. They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm making sense, but that's my two cents on the issue.",
            "Honestly, I don't think so. \n\nLet me put it this way... If Myspace is a public platform, it's only logical that what's posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. I mean, if you post something online, you have to consider the possibility that it'll be seen by a wider audience. In this case, the school officials were just doing their job to keep the school a safe environment. \n\nThink about it, if they're lurking on Myspace just to catch students engaging in activities that aren't allowed, that's a different story. But if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, as long as it's done to keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. And that's exactly what school officials were doing - making sure the school is a safe environment. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is secure, especially after things like the Columbine shooting. They were just doing drills and stuff to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nSo, in this case, I think the school officials were just doing their job to make the school a safer place. And if that means monitoring Myspace, then so be it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you post something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the fact that it could be seen by anyone. And once it's online, it's hard to take it back. \n\nI mean, even if you're just joking around with friends, there's a risk that something you say could get back to the wrong people. It's just something to be aware of when you're posting online.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I don't think it was an invasion of privacy. If school officials are monitoring Myspace to keep students safe, then that's their job. And if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, then I think that's perfectly okay.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that my perspective on the war has changed over time. Initially, I was really passionate about it because it was a direct response to the 9/11 attacks, which personally affected me. I thought we should strike back and show the world that we wouldn't tolerate such atrocities. However, as time went on, I started to realize that we didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to a lot of problems. I think we overlooked the fact that the people in that region are complex and deeply entrenched in their own conflicts, and we couldn't just impose our will on them.\n\nTo be frank, I'm not sure I care about what's happening over there anymore. It's like they're fighting among themselves, and we're just getting in the way. I don't think our presence is making a significant difference, and I'm starting to think that we should just leave and let them sort out their own problems. War is a different beast for them than it is for us, and I'm not convinced that they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out.\n\nI think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. We went in without a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve, and it's been a disaster. I'm not convinced that we're making progress, and I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. Eventually, we'll leave, and the situation will collapse. We're doing more harm to ourselves by staying in the conflict than good.\n\nLooking back, I think we were caught up in the hype and didn't think things through. We wanted to respond to 9/11, and President Bush took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. At the time, I understood his motivations, but I think we could have handled it differently. We should have taken the time to develop a clear plan and strategy for rebuilding the country, rather than just rushing in with a bunch of guns and bombs.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think we're in a position to make a significant difference in the region. The people there have their own ways and cultures, and we can't change that. I think we should acknowledge that and just leave them to sort out their own problems. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying in the conflict forever. It's time for us to move on and let them take care of themselves."
