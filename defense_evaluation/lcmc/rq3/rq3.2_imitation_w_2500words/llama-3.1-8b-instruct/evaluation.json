            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in several ways. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of many things. \n\nFor instance, they have strong views on things like gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, I think they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and some are even disagreeing with them on certain subjects. This makes me feel that the Church has the wrong stance on these matters.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for example, might make it uncomfortable for those who support it to be part of a community that teaches it's completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I also don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's hard to say whether allowing these things would have prevented past issues, but I don't think it would have necessarily made a difference.\n\nThe idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but it's not a reason to deny them a family life or relationships with others. Everyone else in the world has their job and their personal life, and I don't see why priests should be any different. It's a bit puzzling that the Catholic Church can't seem to understand this.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage.  I think people should be able to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives, and if that means marrying someone of the same sex, then so be it.  I don't think it's fair to hold people accountable for their sexual orientation - it's not something they can control, and it's not something they can change.  It's just who they are.\n\nI think it's wrong for society to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.  I mean, if a man and a woman can get married, then why can't two people of the same sex?  It doesn't seem fair or just to deny them the same rights.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's something I've given a lot of thought to, but it seems to me that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can choose.  We're all born with it, and it's a natural part of who we are.  So, I don't think it's right for the government to interfere with people's personal lives and dictate who they can and can't marry.\n\nI think the federal government should leave this issue alone.  It's not a matter of law, and it's not a matter of national security.  It's just a matter of people being able to live their lives as they see fit.  And if that means being in a same-sex relationship, then that's their choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any place in people's personal lives, and I think they should stay out of it.  People should be free to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit, without the government telling them what they can and can't do.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is based on a narrow-minded perspective. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; they're fundamentally different, yet equally valid.\n\nIn reality, same-sex couples face numerous civil rights issues, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're not considered family, so they can't be present when their partner is hospitalized or even visit them. This is illogical, especially considering that many same-sex couples are committed to each other for life.\n\nStudies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. It's essentially the same thing – a committed relationship between two people. The problem lies in the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, then why not marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. Separate but equal is not an acceptable solution. Same-sex couples are not asking for special treatment; they want the same rights and respect as everyone else.\n\nThe argument about adoption and community issues is also flawed. Children of same-sex couples are not inherently damaged or less deserving of love and support. In fact, they're often subjected to bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can have long-term effects.\n\nThe idea that children of same-sex parents are more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation is also unfounded. Parenting skills are the same, regardless of the parents' relationship status. It's about personal choices, not orientation.\n\nThe federal government should take a more proactive role in making gay marriage legal across the country. Instead of passing an amendment that discriminates against a minority group, they should focus on promoting equality and inclusivity.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his personal beliefs, which are influenced by his religious views on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not impose its moral standards on an entire country, especially when it contradicts the values of other groups.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage due to misconceptions about the origins of homosexuality, such as it being a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people listened to research and evidence-based information, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, the world would be a more accepting place.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the hospital pharmacy where I work during the summer. So, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the public, no way, but for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, just because a substance is restricted doesn't mean it's not beneficial. For instance, we use certain controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets in the pharmacy, and they're used because they have benefits. So, if we deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because it's stigmatized, that doesn't make sense to me. We should acknowledge its benefits.\n\nYou know, there are a lot of drugs that are banned, but we still use them because they're helpful. If people can't accept the benefits of marijuana because of its negative image, well, I think that's a problem. We should get rid of the stigma surrounding marijuana and then people might be able to use it responsibly.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really bad impression of marijuana because it's an illegal substance. But it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. If we change people's perception of marijuana and make it seem less scary, they might use it responsibly. At least, that's what I think. \n\nIt's not that simple, though. I think we should introduce it gradually, but not all at once, to avoid abuse. First, we need to get rid of that negative image surrounding marijuana. If we do that, people might be able to use it responsibly. And of course, for medical purposes, that's definitely a good thing.",
            "I think the church is now adapting to the 21st century, but not as strictly as it used to be. Growing up, I was used to going to church every Sunday and dressing up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. My private school friends and I would all attend on the weekends, but now they've introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people tend to dress more casually, even during summer when they come straight from the beach. It's also common to see families running in late, which has made the atmosphere a lot more relaxed. Even at morning masses, people now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from when I used to dress up. One thing that really stands out to me is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, I don't know the politics behind the church, but that's the biggest thing I've noticed. As for the recent accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have pedophilic tendencies, so it's not about the rules regarding marriage. When people choose to become priests, it's their own decision, and some other religions allow them to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married at the same time, maybe they should consider a different faith. I think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics, not upbringing. You can't hide it, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they knew about it in all cases.",
            "To be honest, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that people were still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks and we kind of jumped into Iraq using various pretexts. The Bush administration made a connection between the Iraq war, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell has come out and said he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious breach of trust, an impeachable offense, and a blatant disregard for the Constitution. Since September 11th, it's been clear that the Bush administration has been trying to push its own agenda, disregarding the Constitution in the process.\n\nIt seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and was also looking to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve that goal. I think the war has gone on long enough, but withdrawing now would lead to potential chaos and more deaths, so it's a tough situation.\n\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, attempting to restore order in Iraq. However, I'm not sure this is the right approach, as it could lead to more problems in the long run, including concerns over Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government seems ineffective, and it's clear that the Parliament isn't functioning well, with the Prime Minister lacking control and radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party vying for power.\n\nTo be frank, I don't have any easy solutions to offer, but I do know that the situation is complex and fraught with difficulties.",
            "I mean, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq lately, and I'm not really sure what to make of it. It's weird because it's not even officially declared as a war. I think it was just kind of a retaliatory thing because we believed Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks. But to be honest, I don't really follow the details of the war that closely. It seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, but it's taking forever, and we're also after their oil. But the thing is, it's causing so much tension and unrest. I guess if we stay, we'd have to try to create democracy, but that's a long process, and if we leave, they'll just be mad at us for messing things up. It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, I don't have a strong opinion on the war. I'm not really sure what to think. But I do think it's weird that we're calling it a war when it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a pretty big deal. And I'm not sure if it's worth it to stay over there and try to help them. It feels like we're wasting resources, and it's not like we're making things better. Plus, it's making President Bush look really bad right now.\n\nIt's kind of like what happened with the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless war. I'm worried that we're going to end up with the same situation here. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are people I know who have family members fighting over there. But at the same time, we've kind of ruined their lives by taking over and making things unsafe. It's a complicated issue, and I don't think there's a clear solution.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that the war in Iraq is a really complicated and tricky situation, and I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. It's going to take a long time to figure it out, and it's going to be hard to make everyone happy.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for the government to make it legal or even declare it as legal. In my opinion, this is something that should be left to the churches, given the principle of separation of church and state, which is clearly stated in the constitution. It's a bit puzzling when people try to enforce their power over it, as it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another, it's a worrying sign. For example, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with a few exceptions in areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what the churches can or can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the country. Even though there were plans to make an amendment, I think it would be a misguided move and contradict what's already been established. Moreover, it would be one of the rare cases where an amendment would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government should stay out of this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. I don't see any compelling reason for the amendment, apart from personal views, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've made my point clear.",
            "Well, let's talk about the war in Iraq. From my perspective, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it seemed like a stretch to me. The government used the emotions of the people who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion. I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think it's a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq, which is just heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government and created a power vacuum, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that followed. They claimed to be implementing a democratic government, but it's a complex and long-term process. It's similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, where they attempted to push out Communists and install democracy.\n\nLooking back, the US government should have known that this wouldn't be an easy or straightforward victory. They're fighting against a large number of insurgents, which is difficult when you're not fighting an actual army, but the citizens of the country. I think the government was poorly prepared for the aftermath of the invasion.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government didn't do this, and now we're still in Iraq in 2006, with many American troops dying and still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces. I believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful invasion, but it's a long-term process.\n\nWe should have been more realistic about the challenges of implementing a new form of government. Democracy in our own country was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war. It's not an easy thing to do, and the government made it seem like a relatively easy task.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, and I can understand why people wanted to let George Bush finish what he started. However, we've been there for so long now, and it's hard to abandon the people we've taken over. We've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just leave now?\n\nBut there's also the consideration of the huge number of American casualties and the astronomical cost of continuing this war. Going back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we're making it a democratic nation, why isn't this happening to other countries too? I think the main reason is the oil issue, as well as the control of resources. It's usually about money and power.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is that the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had these weapons, weren't targeted. It seems like the US government isn't being thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making.\n\nAll I can hope for is that this war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. However, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I'm pretty clear where I stand on the issue of gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. I've always been of the opinion that it should be a personal preference, and that people shouldn't be denied rights because of something they can't control. Science has even proven that it's not just a matter of sociology, but also has a significant biological component.\n\nI think it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something that's not within their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal and household issue that should be left alone.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other families - they walk their dogs and live their lives without any complications. But if we let politicians like Bush decide what marriage means and how it should be interpreted, I think it's just ridiculous.\n\nIt's interesting to note that research has shown that there's a chemical factor in the brain that might make someone predisposed to being homosexual. It's not something that's determined by upbringing or environment, like having a certain number of sisters or a particular family dynamic. So, there's a strong biological argument for why gay marriage should be recognized.\n\nOne of the main issues with marriage being a public domain is that it's not something that's private or personal. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it without making a big public spectacle, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it becomes a national news story. I think it's something that should be treated as a private, personal matter, not a public issue.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's essentially a public forum, and once it's out there, it's out there for good. As an R.A., I've personally dealt with this issue before, and it's something that's really worth considering.\n\nWhen you put something online, it can definitely shape people's perceptions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or crime, people will take notice, and it's not just your online friends who will see it. If someone brings it to the attention of school officials, they have to take it seriously, even if it was just a joke. The internet is a public space, and what you post can be seen by anyone.\n\nIt's hard to know what's serious and what's not, as some people might be joking around, while others might be genuinely concerned. I recall a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it, and it turned out that the person's Facebook profile had some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke. \n\nWhen you put something online, you relinquish some control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to what you've shared.\n\nSchool officials should be cautious about friending their students on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook, as it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a tricky situation, and I don't think it's a good idea for teachers to create fake accounts to monitor their students' online activity.\n\nAs an R.A., I personally prefer not to be connected to my residents on social media, as I don't want to know about their personal lives unless they choose to share it with me. That way, I can maintain a professional boundary and focus on supporting them when needed.",
            "Honestly, I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. At the beginning, I thought the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal a long time ago. Now, it's possible we're fighting just to prove our military might, rather than achieving a genuine purpose. I'm also skeptical about the original motivations behind the war, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first few months of the war, and that was a powerful statement in itself. But the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year or more is just ridiculous. It's clear that our purpose has been misinterpreted and distorted over time.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, I believe our reasons have been watered down and misconceived. It seems like we're still fighting just to be at war, rather than seeking a decisive victory or a clear conclusion.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on for far too long. It's high time for the government to fend for themselves. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. We should be focusing on our own internal issues, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. These are pressing problems that deserve our attention and financial investment, not the billions we're spending on a foreign war.\n\nIt's a shame that our own citizens are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer clear. The money we're spending on this war could be better spent addressing our own problems and improving our own lives. I think that's a much more worthy use of our resources.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit confused about something, so let me ask for clarification on this. I think there was a situation where someone found out about something because someone else looked at their information online.\n\nOkay, so I think I get it. If you put stuff on the internet, it's pretty much out there for anyone to see. For example, on Myspace, you have to make yourself a friend with someone before they can see your profile, but even then, you're giving them permission to see it. So, basically, if you put something online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see it.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's actually a good thing that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening. It's tough to balance this, though. On the one hand, we can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, if they're only looking for people who might be doing something wrong, it feels like discrimination.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is. Maybe it depends on the situation and why they were looking at the person's profile in the first place. Were they just randomly browsing or were they looking for something specific?\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a TV show once that was about how easy it is for people to get information about you online and it freaked me out. It's not that I think it's a huge deal, but it's just weird to think that people can get so much information about you so easily.\n\nFor example, I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they've been able to figure out my screen name and IM me. They know what I look like, where I am during the day, who my friends are, and all sorts of other stuff. It's hard to know what to do because I want to be able to communicate with my friends online, but at the same time, I don't want to make it easy for strangers to find out about me.\n\nThis is a tricky issue because you never really know who's looking at what online. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned students from having Myspace accounts, and I'm not sure how they had the right to do that. Is it a privacy issue or was it something else entirely? I'm not really sure.\n\nThat's about all I can think of on this topic.",
            "I was thinking about the Iraq War, and I have to admit, I feel a bit hypocritical even bringing it up. I'm not sure I'm ready to join the crowd of people who claim they were against it from the start. It's just that, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people everywhere, except within the administration, thought it was a bad idea from the beginning.\n\nIf we take a look at recent polls, it's striking - around 75 to 80% of the global population thinks the war was a mistake. Even in Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view. Furthermore, 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that they should be withdrawn within the year. It's hard to ignore these results.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war has been a disaster from the very beginning. It's not just that the situation is complicated; it's the fundamental cultural differences between the US and the Middle Eastern countries that make it almost impossible to resolve. The idea of bringing democracy to an area where it's not naturally accepted is a flawed one.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam was a good guy; no one is. However, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. And that's exactly what happened. I don't see a clear reason for us to stay in Iraq anymore. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard any convincing arguments.\n\nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. But I don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting to note that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective.\n\nIf we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We can at least claim that we're leaving because they wanted us to. And if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the good guys - to some extent. Not that we'll ever be seen as completely good in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though - it's more about the specific field of work. I mean, overall, women seem to face more difficulties because of this concept of a \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite supposed equality, many people struggle to work under a female supervisor. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for so long. In the workplace, women often see opportunities they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them to those positions because it's not common for women to hold upper-management roles. The same thing happens in other fields like fashion or stay-at-home parenting, where men are often stigmatized for choosing to stay home and care for their children.\n\nIt's common for people to look down on stay-at-home dads because society expects men to be the breadwinners. This can be tough on them, especially when they've always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives and helping raise them. Meanwhile, their wives might be the breadwinners, and it's just not socially accepted.\n\nIn the fashion industry, guys are often not taken seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it has to do with the fact that men who are into fashion often don't fit the traditional mold, and people might question their expertise on women's fashion. Depending on the field, there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because it's deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress since the 1800s, but it's happening slowly. Women are rising to higher positions, becoming CEOs, and gaining more acceptance in the business world. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, too, as people realize that maybe the female partner does have the better job or wants to be the breadwinner. Similarly, in the fashion industry, people are starting to understand that guys might be listening to their female friends or wives and still have valuable opinions.\n\nTo promote positive change, we need to showcase the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but we shouldn't push it too hard, or people will resist. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become more accepted, so I'm not sure what else we can do that hasn't already been done. If we move too quickly, people will resist, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from, their education, or even their grammar. For example, a man from a rural area with poor grammar but exceptional intelligence might be looked down upon by others who value better-educated, more polished individuals. It's another example of how discrimination can work across different groups, and I'm not sure what to say about it.",
            "So it seems like they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. What that means is it's no longer a serious crime, but more like a traffic ticket – you get cited, not arrested and charged, which can have some serious repercussions on things like job hunting. \n\nAlthough decriminalizing it takes away some of those harsh penalties, people are still worried about the long-term consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's not as severe. On the other hand, some argue that arresting people for pot possession costs a lot of money – think about all the resources used to catch, book, and court them, not to mention the cost of public defenders and judges. \n\nWhen you consider that many cities are already financially struggling, it's hard to justify the expense. Some places might not want to make that change, even if it frees up funds for more important things like education and social programs. However, in cities where people tend to be more open-minded, it's a different story. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal and open to new ideas, decriminalizing marijuana is seen as a good thing. It can actually bring in more revenue for the city, which can be used for good causes.\n\nIt's not all about making pot freely available, though. There are good reasons to be cautious. If it were fully legal, it could lead to issues like people smoking and driving, which is already a concern. Plus, there's still a stigma around smoking marijuana in many areas. Making it widely available could be awkward for some people.\n\nAs for the comparison between marijuana and alcohol, while both have negative effects, marijuana tends to affect people's lifestyle choices more than their motor skills. However, everyone reacts differently to substances, depending on their personality and ability to practice moderation. It's hard to generalize, but both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of issues.",
            "I think yes because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a good thing. For example, the Catholic Church has been doing things the same way for a long time. While it's great to be connected to the past, it's also essential to be open to change. I believe a lot of Catholics feel they need to attend church every week and adhere to the rules very strictly. However, this sometimes leads to a kind of intolerance towards those who don't follow all the teachings or come from other faiths.\n\nFor instance, when my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, they were refused because my dad was an Episcopalian. This seems hypocritical to me, as the Catholic Church teaches us to love and accept others, but in practice, it doesn't always follow this principle. I think the Catholic Church's rules and practices often conflict. They can be outdated, but the Church still sticks to them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in terms of reducing pedophilic behavior. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship altogether. Allowing priests to be married might not alter their behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to get married would be a solution to the problem of child abuse within the Church. Such behavior is likely to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure this out - I haven't really made up my mind on it yet. It's tough because there's a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means. It's a tricky topic because it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone.\n\nI think this is one of the most challenging issues we're facing today. Considering marriage as a sacrament, the government shouldn't give special treatment or tax breaks just because someone's been baptized. If two people are in a civil union, I believe the government should just recognize it for what it is - two people coming together.\n\nIt's not about whether the marriage is \"sacred\" or whatever; it's about two people being together. The separation of church and state should remain intact. The fact that some people want to restrict gay marriage is just the same as any other civil union - two people getting together.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is completely unnecessary. It's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution. Defining or banning gay marriage just isn't that important, so why should it be a constitutional amendment?\n\nIn my opinion, it's just not worth altering the constitution for. It's as simple as that.",
            "To be honest, I've always had mixed feelings about homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. However, knowing many gay friends has made me think differently about the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't think it's something that should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nLiving in a democratic state means you're part of a community that generally supports a particular stance on issues like gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state where gay marriage is accepted, it's hard to argue with the decision. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have the same opportunities, and that's why I think each state should have the freedom to decide on gay marriage.\n\nI already kind of answered that, but to clarify, I don't think President Bush should have the authority to ban gay marriage nationwide. It's up to individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves, and I don't think the president should impose his views on the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his decision to make. Some things should be left up to individual states, and besides, he'll be out of office soon anyway. If a new president wants to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. Ultimately, it's up to each state to decide what works best for them. They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm making sense, but that's my two cents on the issue.",
            "Honestly, I don't think so. \n\nLet me put it this way... If Myspace is a public platform, it's only logical that what's posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. I mean, if you post something online, you have to consider the possibility that it'll be seen by a wider audience. In this case, the school officials were just doing their job to keep the school a safe environment. \n\nThink about it, if they're lurking on Myspace just to catch students engaging in activities that aren't allowed, that's a different story. But if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, as long as it's done to keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. And that's exactly what school officials were doing - making sure the school is a safe environment. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is secure, especially after things like the Columbine shooting. They were just doing drills and stuff to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nSo, in this case, I think the school officials were just doing their job to make the school a safer place. And if that means monitoring Myspace, then so be it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you post something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the fact that it could be seen by anyone. And once it's online, it's hard to take it back. \n\nI mean, even if you're just joking around with friends, there's a risk that something you say could get back to the wrong people. It's just something to be aware of when you're posting online.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I don't think it was an invasion of privacy. If school officials are monitoring Myspace to keep students safe, then that's their job. And if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, then I think that's perfectly okay.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that my perspective on the war has changed over time. Initially, I was really passionate about it because it was a direct response to the 9/11 attacks, which personally affected me. I thought we should strike back and show the world that we wouldn't tolerate such atrocities. However, as time went on, I started to realize that we didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to a lot of problems. I think we overlooked the fact that the people in that region are complex and deeply entrenched in their own conflicts, and we couldn't just impose our will on them.\n\nTo be frank, I'm not sure I care about what's happening over there anymore. It's like they're fighting among themselves, and we're just getting in the way. I don't think our presence is making a significant difference, and I'm starting to think that we should just leave and let them sort out their own problems. War is a different beast for them than it is for us, and I'm not convinced that they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out.\n\nI think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. We went in without a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve, and it's been a disaster. I'm not convinced that we're making progress, and I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. Eventually, we'll leave, and the situation will collapse. We're doing more harm to ourselves by staying in the conflict than good.\n\nLooking back, I think we were caught up in the hype and didn't think things through. We wanted to respond to 9/11, and President Bush took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. At the time, I understood his motivations, but I think we could have handled it differently. We should have taken the time to develop a clear plan and strategy for rebuilding the country, rather than just rushing in with a bunch of guns and bombs.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think we're in a position to make a significant difference in the region. The people there have their own ways and cultures, and we can't change that. I think we should acknowledge that and just leave them to sort out their own problems. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying in the conflict forever. It's time for us to move on and let them take care of themselves."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in several ways. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of many things. \n\nFor instance, they have strong views on things like gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, I think they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and some are even disagreeing with them on certain subjects. This makes me feel that the Church has the wrong stance on these matters.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for example, might make it uncomfortable for those who support it to be part of a community that teaches it's completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I also don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's hard to say whether allowing these things would have prevented past issues, but I don't think it would have necessarily made a difference.\n\nThe idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but it's not a reason to deny them a family life or relationships with others. Everyone else in the world has their job and their personal life, and I don't see why priests should be any different. It's a bit puzzling that the Catholic Church can't seem to understand this.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage.  I think people should be able to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives, and if that means marrying someone of the same sex, then so be it.  I don't think it's fair to hold people accountable for their sexual orientation - it's not something they can control, and it's not something they can change.  It's just who they are.\n\nI think it's wrong for society to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.  I mean, if a man and a woman can get married, then why can't two people of the same sex?  It doesn't seem fair or just to deny them the same rights.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's something I've given a lot of thought to, but it seems to me that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can choose.  We're all born with it, and it's a natural part of who we are.  So, I don't think it's right for the government to interfere with people's personal lives and dictate who they can and can't marry.\n\nI think the federal government should leave this issue alone.  It's not a matter of law, and it's not a matter of national security.  It's just a matter of people being able to live their lives as they see fit.  And if that means being in a same-sex relationship, then that's their choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any place in people's personal lives, and I think they should stay out of it.  People should be free to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit, without the government telling them what they can and can't do.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is based on a narrow-minded perspective. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; they're fundamentally different, yet equally valid.\n\nIn reality, same-sex couples face numerous civil rights issues, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're not considered family, so they can't be present when their partner is hospitalized or even visit them. This is illogical, especially considering that many same-sex couples are committed to each other for life.\n\nStudies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. It's essentially the same thing – a committed relationship between two people. The problem lies in the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, then why not marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. Separate but equal is not an acceptable solution. Same-sex couples are not asking for special treatment; they want the same rights and respect as everyone else.\n\nThe argument about adoption and community issues is also flawed. Children of same-sex couples are not inherently damaged or less deserving of love and support. In fact, they're often subjected to bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can have long-term effects.\n\nThe idea that children of same-sex parents are more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation is also unfounded. Parenting skills are the same, regardless of the parents' relationship status. It's about personal choices, not orientation.\n\nThe federal government should take a more proactive role in making gay marriage legal across the country. Instead of passing an amendment that discriminates against a minority group, they should focus on promoting equality and inclusivity.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his personal beliefs, which are influenced by his religious views on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not impose its moral standards on an entire country, especially when it contradicts the values of other groups.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage due to misconceptions about the origins of homosexuality, such as it being a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people listened to research and evidence-based information, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, the world would be a more accepting place.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the hospital pharmacy where I work during the summer. So, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the public, no way, but for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, just because a substance is restricted doesn't mean it's not beneficial. For instance, we use certain controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets in the pharmacy, and they're used because they have benefits. So, if we deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because it's stigmatized, that doesn't make sense to me. We should acknowledge its benefits.\n\nYou know, there are a lot of drugs that are banned, but we still use them because they're helpful. If people can't accept the benefits of marijuana because of its negative image, well, I think that's a problem. We should get rid of the stigma surrounding marijuana and then people might be able to use it responsibly.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really bad impression of marijuana because it's an illegal substance. But it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. If we change people's perception of marijuana and make it seem less scary, they might use it responsibly. At least, that's what I think. \n\nIt's not that simple, though. I think we should introduce it gradually, but not all at once, to avoid abuse. First, we need to get rid of that negative image surrounding marijuana. If we do that, people might be able to use it responsibly. And of course, for medical purposes, that's definitely a good thing.",
            "I think the church is now adapting to the 21st century, but not as strictly as it used to be. Growing up, I was used to going to church every Sunday and dressing up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. My private school friends and I would all attend on the weekends, but now they've introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people tend to dress more casually, even during summer when they come straight from the beach. It's also common to see families running in late, which has made the atmosphere a lot more relaxed. Even at morning masses, people now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from when I used to dress up. One thing that really stands out to me is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, I don't know the politics behind the church, but that's the biggest thing I've noticed. As for the recent accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have pedophilic tendencies, so it's not about the rules regarding marriage. When people choose to become priests, it's their own decision, and some other religions allow them to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married at the same time, maybe they should consider a different faith. I think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics, not upbringing. You can't hide it, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they knew about it in all cases.",
            "To be honest, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that people were still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks and we kind of jumped into Iraq using various pretexts. The Bush administration made a connection between the Iraq war, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell has come out and said he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious breach of trust, an impeachable offense, and a blatant disregard for the Constitution. Since September 11th, it's been clear that the Bush administration has been trying to push its own agenda, disregarding the Constitution in the process.\n\nIt seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and was also looking to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve that goal. I think the war has gone on long enough, but withdrawing now would lead to potential chaos and more deaths, so it's a tough situation.\n\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, attempting to restore order in Iraq. However, I'm not sure this is the right approach, as it could lead to more problems in the long run, including concerns over Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government seems ineffective, and it's clear that the Parliament isn't functioning well, with the Prime Minister lacking control and radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party vying for power.\n\nTo be frank, I don't have any easy solutions to offer, but I do know that the situation is complex and fraught with difficulties.",
            "I mean, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq lately, and I'm not really sure what to make of it. It's weird because it's not even officially declared as a war. I think it was just kind of a retaliatory thing because we believed Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks. But to be honest, I don't really follow the details of the war that closely. It seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, but it's taking forever, and we're also after their oil. But the thing is, it's causing so much tension and unrest. I guess if we stay, we'd have to try to create democracy, but that's a long process, and if we leave, they'll just be mad at us for messing things up. It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, I don't have a strong opinion on the war. I'm not really sure what to think. But I do think it's weird that we're calling it a war when it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a pretty big deal. And I'm not sure if it's worth it to stay over there and try to help them. It feels like we're wasting resources, and it's not like we're making things better. Plus, it's making President Bush look really bad right now.\n\nIt's kind of like what happened with the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless war. I'm worried that we're going to end up with the same situation here. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are people I know who have family members fighting over there. But at the same time, we've kind of ruined their lives by taking over and making things unsafe. It's a complicated issue, and I don't think there's a clear solution.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that the war in Iraq is a really complicated and tricky situation, and I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. It's going to take a long time to figure it out, and it's going to be hard to make everyone happy.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for the government to make it legal or even declare it as legal. In my opinion, this is something that should be left to the churches, given the principle of separation of church and state, which is clearly stated in the constitution. It's a bit puzzling when people try to enforce their power over it, as it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another, it's a worrying sign. For example, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with a few exceptions in areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what the churches can or can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the country. Even though there were plans to make an amendment, I think it would be a misguided move and contradict what's already been established. Moreover, it would be one of the rare cases where an amendment would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government should stay out of this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. I don't see any compelling reason for the amendment, apart from personal views, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've made my point clear.",
            "Well, let's talk about the war in Iraq. From my perspective, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it seemed like a stretch to me. The government used the emotions of the people who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion. I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think it's a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq, which is just heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government and created a power vacuum, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that followed. They claimed to be implementing a democratic government, but it's a complex and long-term process. It's similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, where they attempted to push out Communists and install democracy.\n\nLooking back, the US government should have known that this wouldn't be an easy or straightforward victory. They're fighting against a large number of insurgents, which is difficult when you're not fighting an actual army, but the citizens of the country. I think the government was poorly prepared for the aftermath of the invasion.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government didn't do this, and now we're still in Iraq in 2006, with many American troops dying and still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces. I believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful invasion, but it's a long-term process.\n\nWe should have been more realistic about the challenges of implementing a new form of government. Democracy in our own country was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war. It's not an easy thing to do, and the government made it seem like a relatively easy task.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, and I can understand why people wanted to let George Bush finish what he started. However, we've been there for so long now, and it's hard to abandon the people we've taken over. We've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just leave now?\n\nBut there's also the consideration of the huge number of American casualties and the astronomical cost of continuing this war. Going back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we're making it a democratic nation, why isn't this happening to other countries too? I think the main reason is the oil issue, as well as the control of resources. It's usually about money and power.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is that the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had these weapons, weren't targeted. It seems like the US government isn't being thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making.\n\nAll I can hope for is that this war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. However, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I'm pretty clear where I stand on the issue of gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. I've always been of the opinion that it should be a personal preference, and that people shouldn't be denied rights because of something they can't control. Science has even proven that it's not just a matter of sociology, but also has a significant biological component.\n\nI think it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something that's not within their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal and household issue that should be left alone.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other families - they walk their dogs and live their lives without any complications. But if we let politicians like Bush decide what marriage means and how it should be interpreted, I think it's just ridiculous.\n\nIt's interesting to note that research has shown that there's a chemical factor in the brain that might make someone predisposed to being homosexual. It's not something that's determined by upbringing or environment, like having a certain number of sisters or a particular family dynamic. So, there's a strong biological argument for why gay marriage should be recognized.\n\nOne of the main issues with marriage being a public domain is that it's not something that's private or personal. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it without making a big public spectacle, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it becomes a national news story. I think it's something that should be treated as a private, personal matter, not a public issue.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's essentially a public forum, and once it's out there, it's out there for good. As an R.A., I've personally dealt with this issue before, and it's something that's really worth considering.\n\nWhen you put something online, it can definitely shape people's perceptions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or crime, people will take notice, and it's not just your online friends who will see it. If someone brings it to the attention of school officials, they have to take it seriously, even if it was just a joke. The internet is a public space, and what you post can be seen by anyone.\n\nIt's hard to know what's serious and what's not, as some people might be joking around, while others might be genuinely concerned. I recall a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it, and it turned out that the person's Facebook profile had some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke. \n\nWhen you put something online, you relinquish some control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to what you've shared.\n\nSchool officials should be cautious about friending their students on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook, as it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a tricky situation, and I don't think it's a good idea for teachers to create fake accounts to monitor their students' online activity.\n\nAs an R.A., I personally prefer not to be connected to my residents on social media, as I don't want to know about their personal lives unless they choose to share it with me. That way, I can maintain a professional boundary and focus on supporting them when needed.",
            "Honestly, I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. At the beginning, I thought the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal a long time ago. Now, it's possible we're fighting just to prove our military might, rather than achieving a genuine purpose. I'm also skeptical about the original motivations behind the war, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first few months of the war, and that was a powerful statement in itself. But the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year or more is just ridiculous. It's clear that our purpose has been misinterpreted and distorted over time.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, I believe our reasons have been watered down and misconceived. It seems like we're still fighting just to be at war, rather than seeking a decisive victory or a clear conclusion.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on for far too long. It's high time for the government to fend for themselves. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. We should be focusing on our own internal issues, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. These are pressing problems that deserve our attention and financial investment, not the billions we're spending on a foreign war.\n\nIt's a shame that our own citizens are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer clear. The money we're spending on this war could be better spent addressing our own problems and improving our own lives. I think that's a much more worthy use of our resources.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit confused about something, so let me ask for clarification on this. I think there was a situation where someone found out about something because someone else looked at their information online.\n\nOkay, so I think I get it. If you put stuff on the internet, it's pretty much out there for anyone to see. For example, on Myspace, you have to make yourself a friend with someone before they can see your profile, but even then, you're giving them permission to see it. So, basically, if you put something online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see it.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's actually a good thing that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening. It's tough to balance this, though. On the one hand, we can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, if they're only looking for people who might be doing something wrong, it feels like discrimination.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is. Maybe it depends on the situation and why they were looking at the person's profile in the first place. Were they just randomly browsing or were they looking for something specific?\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a TV show once that was about how easy it is for people to get information about you online and it freaked me out. It's not that I think it's a huge deal, but it's just weird to think that people can get so much information about you so easily.\n\nFor example, I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they've been able to figure out my screen name and IM me. They know what I look like, where I am during the day, who my friends are, and all sorts of other stuff. It's hard to know what to do because I want to be able to communicate with my friends online, but at the same time, I don't want to make it easy for strangers to find out about me.\n\nThis is a tricky issue because you never really know who's looking at what online. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned students from having Myspace accounts, and I'm not sure how they had the right to do that. Is it a privacy issue or was it something else entirely? I'm not really sure.\n\nThat's about all I can think of on this topic.",
            "I was thinking about the Iraq War, and I have to admit, I feel a bit hypocritical even bringing it up. I'm not sure I'm ready to join the crowd of people who claim they were against it from the start. It's just that, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people everywhere, except within the administration, thought it was a bad idea from the beginning.\n\nIf we take a look at recent polls, it's striking - around 75 to 80% of the global population thinks the war was a mistake. Even in Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view. Furthermore, 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that they should be withdrawn within the year. It's hard to ignore these results.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war has been a disaster from the very beginning. It's not just that the situation is complicated; it's the fundamental cultural differences between the US and the Middle Eastern countries that make it almost impossible to resolve. The idea of bringing democracy to an area where it's not naturally accepted is a flawed one.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam was a good guy; no one is. However, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. And that's exactly what happened. I don't see a clear reason for us to stay in Iraq anymore. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard any convincing arguments.\n\nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. But I don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting to note that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective.\n\nIf we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We can at least claim that we're leaving because they wanted us to. And if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the good guys - to some extent. Not that we'll ever be seen as completely good in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though - it's more about the specific field of work. I mean, overall, women seem to face more difficulties because of this concept of a \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite supposed equality, many people struggle to work under a female supervisor. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for so long. In the workplace, women often see opportunities they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them to those positions because it's not common for women to hold upper-management roles. The same thing happens in other fields like fashion or stay-at-home parenting, where men are often stigmatized for choosing to stay home and care for their children.\n\nIt's common for people to look down on stay-at-home dads because society expects men to be the breadwinners. This can be tough on them, especially when they've always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives and helping raise them. Meanwhile, their wives might be the breadwinners, and it's just not socially accepted.\n\nIn the fashion industry, guys are often not taken seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it has to do with the fact that men who are into fashion often don't fit the traditional mold, and people might question their expertise on women's fashion. Depending on the field, there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because it's deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress since the 1800s, but it's happening slowly. Women are rising to higher positions, becoming CEOs, and gaining more acceptance in the business world. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, too, as people realize that maybe the female partner does have the better job or wants to be the breadwinner. Similarly, in the fashion industry, people are starting to understand that guys might be listening to their female friends or wives and still have valuable opinions.\n\nTo promote positive change, we need to showcase the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but we shouldn't push it too hard, or people will resist. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become more accepted, so I'm not sure what else we can do that hasn't already been done. If we move too quickly, people will resist, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from, their education, or even their grammar. For example, a man from a rural area with poor grammar but exceptional intelligence might be looked down upon by others who value better-educated, more polished individuals. It's another example of how discrimination can work across different groups, and I'm not sure what to say about it.",
            "So it seems like they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. What that means is it's no longer a serious crime, but more like a traffic ticket – you get cited, not arrested and charged, which can have some serious repercussions on things like job hunting. \n\nAlthough decriminalizing it takes away some of those harsh penalties, people are still worried about the long-term consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's not as severe. On the other hand, some argue that arresting people for pot possession costs a lot of money – think about all the resources used to catch, book, and court them, not to mention the cost of public defenders and judges. \n\nWhen you consider that many cities are already financially struggling, it's hard to justify the expense. Some places might not want to make that change, even if it frees up funds for more important things like education and social programs. However, in cities where people tend to be more open-minded, it's a different story. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal and open to new ideas, decriminalizing marijuana is seen as a good thing. It can actually bring in more revenue for the city, which can be used for good causes.\n\nIt's not all about making pot freely available, though. There are good reasons to be cautious. If it were fully legal, it could lead to issues like people smoking and driving, which is already a concern. Plus, there's still a stigma around smoking marijuana in many areas. Making it widely available could be awkward for some people.\n\nAs for the comparison between marijuana and alcohol, while both have negative effects, marijuana tends to affect people's lifestyle choices more than their motor skills. However, everyone reacts differently to substances, depending on their personality and ability to practice moderation. It's hard to generalize, but both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of issues.",
            "I think yes because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a good thing. For example, the Catholic Church has been doing things the same way for a long time. While it's great to be connected to the past, it's also essential to be open to change. I believe a lot of Catholics feel they need to attend church every week and adhere to the rules very strictly. However, this sometimes leads to a kind of intolerance towards those who don't follow all the teachings or come from other faiths.\n\nFor instance, when my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, they were refused because my dad was an Episcopalian. This seems hypocritical to me, as the Catholic Church teaches us to love and accept others, but in practice, it doesn't always follow this principle. I think the Catholic Church's rules and practices often conflict. They can be outdated, but the Church still sticks to them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in terms of reducing pedophilic behavior. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship altogether. Allowing priests to be married might not alter their behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to get married would be a solution to the problem of child abuse within the Church. Such behavior is likely to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure this out - I haven't really made up my mind on it yet. It's tough because there's a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means. It's a tricky topic because it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone.\n\nI think this is one of the most challenging issues we're facing today. Considering marriage as a sacrament, the government shouldn't give special treatment or tax breaks just because someone's been baptized. If two people are in a civil union, I believe the government should just recognize it for what it is - two people coming together.\n\nIt's not about whether the marriage is \"sacred\" or whatever; it's about two people being together. The separation of church and state should remain intact. The fact that some people want to restrict gay marriage is just the same as any other civil union - two people getting together.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is completely unnecessary. It's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution. Defining or banning gay marriage just isn't that important, so why should it be a constitutional amendment?\n\nIn my opinion, it's just not worth altering the constitution for. It's as simple as that.",
            "To be honest, I've always had mixed feelings about homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. However, knowing many gay friends has made me think differently about the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't think it's something that should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nLiving in a democratic state means you're part of a community that generally supports a particular stance on issues like gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state where gay marriage is accepted, it's hard to argue with the decision. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have the same opportunities, and that's why I think each state should have the freedom to decide on gay marriage.\n\nI already kind of answered that, but to clarify, I don't think President Bush should have the authority to ban gay marriage nationwide. It's up to individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves, and I don't think the president should impose his views on the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his decision to make. Some things should be left up to individual states, and besides, he'll be out of office soon anyway. If a new president wants to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. Ultimately, it's up to each state to decide what works best for them. They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm making sense, but that's my two cents on the issue.",
            "Honestly, I don't think so. \n\nLet me put it this way... If Myspace is a public platform, it's only logical that what's posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. I mean, if you post something online, you have to consider the possibility that it'll be seen by a wider audience. In this case, the school officials were just doing their job to keep the school a safe environment. \n\nThink about it, if they're lurking on Myspace just to catch students engaging in activities that aren't allowed, that's a different story. But if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, as long as it's done to keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. And that's exactly what school officials were doing - making sure the school is a safe environment. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is secure, especially after things like the Columbine shooting. They were just doing drills and stuff to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nSo, in this case, I think the school officials were just doing their job to make the school a safer place. And if that means monitoring Myspace, then so be it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you post something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the fact that it could be seen by anyone. And once it's online, it's hard to take it back. \n\nI mean, even if you're just joking around with friends, there's a risk that something you say could get back to the wrong people. It's just something to be aware of when you're posting online.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I don't think it was an invasion of privacy. If school officials are monitoring Myspace to keep students safe, then that's their job. And if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, then I think that's perfectly okay.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that my perspective on the war has changed over time. Initially, I was really passionate about it because it was a direct response to the 9/11 attacks, which personally affected me. I thought we should strike back and show the world that we wouldn't tolerate such atrocities. However, as time went on, I started to realize that we didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to a lot of problems. I think we overlooked the fact that the people in that region are complex and deeply entrenched in their own conflicts, and we couldn't just impose our will on them.\n\nTo be frank, I'm not sure I care about what's happening over there anymore. It's like they're fighting among themselves, and we're just getting in the way. I don't think our presence is making a significant difference, and I'm starting to think that we should just leave and let them sort out their own problems. War is a different beast for them than it is for us, and I'm not convinced that they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out.\n\nI think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. We went in without a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve, and it's been a disaster. I'm not convinced that we're making progress, and I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. Eventually, we'll leave, and the situation will collapse. We're doing more harm to ourselves by staying in the conflict than good.\n\nLooking back, I think we were caught up in the hype and didn't think things through. We wanted to respond to 9/11, and President Bush took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. At the time, I understood his motivations, but I think we could have handled it differently. We should have taken the time to develop a clear plan and strategy for rebuilding the country, rather than just rushing in with a bunch of guns and bombs.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think we're in a position to make a significant difference in the region. The people there have their own ways and cultures, and we can't change that. I think we should acknowledge that and just leave them to sort out their own problems. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying in the conflict forever. It's time for us to move on and let them take care of themselves."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in several ways. They've been losing followers, and I believe it's because they're not very accepting of many things. \n\nFor instance, they have strong views on things like gay marriages, abortion, and birth control, which are a bit outdated. If they were to adapt to a more modern way of thinking, I think they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues, and some are even disagreeing with them on certain subjects. This makes me feel that the Church has the wrong stance on these matters.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for example, might make it uncomfortable for those who support it to be part of a community that teaches it's completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a community that doesn't agree with that. I also don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. It's hard to say whether allowing these things would have prevented past issues, but I don't think it would have necessarily made a difference.\n\nThe idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but it's not a reason to deny them a family life or relationships with others. Everyone else in the world has their job and their personal life, and I don't see why priests should be any different. It's a bit puzzling that the Catholic Church can't seem to understand this.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage.  I think people should be able to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives, and if that means marrying someone of the same sex, then so be it.  I don't think it's fair to hold people accountable for their sexual orientation - it's not something they can control, and it's not something they can change.  It's just who they are.\n\nI think it's wrong for society to dictate who can and can't get married based on their sexual orientation.  I mean, if a man and a woman can get married, then why can't two people of the same sex?  It doesn't seem fair or just to deny them the same rights.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's something I've given a lot of thought to, but it seems to me that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can choose.  We're all born with it, and it's a natural part of who we are.  So, I don't think it's right for the government to interfere with people's personal lives and dictate who they can and can't marry.\n\nI think the federal government should leave this issue alone.  It's not a matter of law, and it's not a matter of national security.  It's just a matter of people being able to live their lives as they see fit.  And if that means being in a same-sex relationship, then that's their choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any place in people's personal lives, and I think they should stay out of it.  People should be free to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit, without the government telling them what they can and can't do.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is based on a narrow-minded perspective. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin; they're fundamentally different, yet equally valid.\n\nIn reality, same-sex couples face numerous civil rights issues, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a partner is in a same-sex relationship, they're not considered family, so they can't be present when their partner is hospitalized or even visit them. This is illogical, especially considering that many same-sex couples are committed to each other for life.\n\nStudies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. It's essentially the same thing – a committed relationship between two people. The problem lies in the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, then why not marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. Separate but equal is not an acceptable solution. Same-sex couples are not asking for special treatment; they want the same rights and respect as everyone else.\n\nThe argument about adoption and community issues is also flawed. Children of same-sex couples are not inherently damaged or less deserving of love and support. In fact, they're often subjected to bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can have long-term effects.\n\nThe idea that children of same-sex parents are more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation is also unfounded. Parenting skills are the same, regardless of the parents' relationship status. It's about personal choices, not orientation.\n\nThe federal government should take a more proactive role in making gay marriage legal across the country. Instead of passing an amendment that discriminates against a minority group, they should focus on promoting equality and inclusivity.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage are rooted in his personal beliefs, which are influenced by his religious views on abortion and stem cell research. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. The government should not impose its moral standards on an entire country, especially when it contradicts the values of other groups.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage due to misconceptions about the origins of homosexuality, such as it being a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. If people listened to research and evidence-based information, rather than popular opinion or cultural norms, the world would be a more accepting place.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the hospital pharmacy where I work during the summer. So, just because a drug is against the law doesn't mean it doesn't have its benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the public, no way, but for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, just because a substance is restricted doesn't mean it's not beneficial. For instance, we use certain controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets in the pharmacy, and they're used because they have benefits. So, if we deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because it's stigmatized, that doesn't make sense to me. We should acknowledge its benefits.\n\nYou know, there are a lot of drugs that are banned, but we still use them because they're helpful. If people can't accept the benefits of marijuana because of its negative image, well, I think that's a problem. We should get rid of the stigma surrounding marijuana and then people might be able to use it responsibly.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really bad impression of marijuana because it's an illegal substance. But it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. If we change people's perception of marijuana and make it seem less scary, they might use it responsibly. At least, that's what I think. \n\nIt's not that simple, though. I think we should introduce it gradually, but not all at once, to avoid abuse. First, we need to get rid of that negative image surrounding marijuana. If we do that, people might be able to use it responsibly. And of course, for medical purposes, that's definitely a good thing.",
            "I think the church is now adapting to the 21st century, but not as strictly as it used to be. Growing up, I was used to going to church every Sunday and dressing up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. My private school friends and I would all attend on the weekends, but now they've introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people tend to dress more casually, even during summer when they come straight from the beach. It's also common to see families running in late, which has made the atmosphere a lot more relaxed. Even at morning masses, people now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from when I used to dress up. One thing that really stands out to me is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other changes, I don't know the politics behind the church, but that's the biggest thing I've noticed. As for the recent accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference. There are men who are married and still have pedophilic tendencies, so it's not about the rules regarding marriage. When people choose to become priests, it's their own decision, and some other religions allow them to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married at the same time, maybe they should consider a different faith. I think people are born with their sexuality, and it's based on genetics, not upbringing. You can't hide it, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's unacceptable. However, I don't think they knew about it in all cases.",
            "To be honest, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think that people were still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks and we kind of jumped into Iraq using various pretexts. The Bush administration made a connection between the Iraq war, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and hasn't owned up to it yet. Even Colin Powell has come out and said he wasn't convinced by the evidence when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious breach of trust, an impeachable offense, and a blatant disregard for the Constitution. Since September 11th, it's been clear that the Bush administration has been trying to push its own agenda, disregarding the Constitution in the process.\n\nIt seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and was also looking to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve that goal. I think the war has gone on long enough, but withdrawing now would lead to potential chaos and more deaths, so it's a tough situation.\n\nThe alternative seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, attempting to restore order in Iraq. However, I'm not sure this is the right approach, as it could lead to more problems in the long run, including concerns over Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government seems ineffective, and it's clear that the Parliament isn't functioning well, with the Prime Minister lacking control and radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party vying for power.\n\nTo be frank, I don't have any easy solutions to offer, but I do know that the situation is complex and fraught with difficulties.",
            "I mean, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq lately, and I'm not really sure what to make of it. It's weird because it's not even officially declared as a war. I think it was just kind of a retaliatory thing because we believed Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks. But to be honest, I don't really follow the details of the war that closely. It seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, but it's taking forever, and we're also after their oil. But the thing is, it's causing so much tension and unrest. I guess if we stay, we'd have to try to create democracy, but that's a long process, and if we leave, they'll just be mad at us for messing things up. It's a tough situation.\n\nHonestly, I don't have a strong opinion on the war. I'm not really sure what to think. But I do think it's weird that we're calling it a war when it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think that's a pretty big deal. And I'm not sure if it's worth it to stay over there and try to help them. It feels like we're wasting resources, and it's not like we're making things better. Plus, it's making President Bush look really bad right now.\n\nIt's kind of like what happened with the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless war. I'm worried that we're going to end up with the same situation here. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are people I know who have family members fighting over there. But at the same time, we've kind of ruined their lives by taking over and making things unsafe. It's a complicated issue, and I don't think there's a clear solution.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that the war in Iraq is a really complicated and tricky situation, and I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. It's going to take a long time to figure it out, and it's going to be hard to make everyone happy.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for the government to make it legal or even declare it as legal. In my opinion, this is something that should be left to the churches, given the principle of separation of church and state, which is clearly stated in the constitution. It's a bit puzzling when people try to enforce their power over it, as it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen people who are pushing to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another, it's a worrying sign. For example, most Catholics and Christians are against it, with a few exceptions in areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what the churches can or can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the country. Even though there were plans to make an amendment, I think it would be a misguided move and contradict what's already been established. Moreover, it would be one of the rare cases where an amendment would restrict the people rather than the government.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government should stay out of this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs as a Catholic, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. I don't see any compelling reason for the amendment, apart from personal views, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society rather than a negative one.\n\nI think I've made my point clear.",
            "Well, let's talk about the war in Iraq. From my perspective, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it seemed like a stretch to me. The government used the emotions of the people who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks to justify the invasion. I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think it's a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War.\n\nA huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq, which is just heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government and created a power vacuum, but they weren't prepared for the chaos that followed. They claimed to be implementing a democratic government, but it's a complex and long-term process. It's similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, where they attempted to push out Communists and install democracy.\n\nLooking back, the US government should have known that this wouldn't be an easy or straightforward victory. They're fighting against a large number of insurgents, which is difficult when you're not fighting an actual army, but the citizens of the country. I think the government was poorly prepared for the aftermath of the invasion.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government didn't do this, and now we're still in Iraq in 2006, with many American troops dying and still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces. I believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful invasion, but it's a long-term process.\n\nWe should have been more realistic about the challenges of implementing a new form of government. Democracy in our own country was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war. It's not an easy thing to do, and the government made it seem like a relatively easy task.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, and I can understand why people wanted to let George Bush finish what he started. However, we've been there for so long now, and it's hard to abandon the people we've taken over. We've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just leave now?\n\nBut there's also the consideration of the huge number of American casualties and the astronomical cost of continuing this war. Going back to the reason for invading Iraq, if we're making it a democratic nation, why isn't this happening to other countries too? I think the main reason is the oil issue, as well as the control of resources. It's usually about money and power.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is that the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had these weapons, weren't targeted. It seems like the US government isn't being thorough or truthful enough in its decision-making.\n\nAll I can hope for is that this war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. However, it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.",
            "I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I'm pretty clear where I stand on the issue of gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. I've always been of the opinion that it should be a personal preference, and that people shouldn't be denied rights because of something they can't control. Science has even proven that it's not just a matter of sociology, but also has a significant biological component.\n\nI think it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something that's not within their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal and household issue that should be left alone.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other families - they walk their dogs and live their lives without any complications. But if we let politicians like Bush decide what marriage means and how it should be interpreted, I think it's just ridiculous.\n\nIt's interesting to note that research has shown that there's a chemical factor in the brain that might make someone predisposed to being homosexual. It's not something that's determined by upbringing or environment, like having a certain number of sisters or a particular family dynamic. So, there's a strong biological argument for why gay marriage should be recognized.\n\nOne of the main issues with marriage being a public domain is that it's not something that's private or personal. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it without making a big public spectacle, but if a gay couple wants to do the same, it becomes a national news story. I think it's something that should be treated as a private, personal matter, not a public issue.",
            "You know, when you post something online, it's essentially a public forum, and once it's out there, it's out there for good. As an R.A., I've personally dealt with this issue before, and it's something that's really worth considering.\n\nWhen you put something online, it can definitely shape people's perceptions of you. If you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or crime, people will take notice, and it's not just your online friends who will see it. If someone brings it to the attention of school officials, they have to take it seriously, even if it was just a joke. The internet is a public space, and what you post can be seen by anyone.\n\nIt's hard to know what's serious and what's not, as some people might be joking around, while others might be genuinely concerned. I recall a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it, and it turned out that the person's Facebook profile had some concerning content that they might have meant as a joke. \n\nWhen you put something online, you relinquish some control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control what others think or how they react to what you've shared.\n\nSchool officials should be cautious about friending their students on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook, as it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a tricky situation, and I don't think it's a good idea for teachers to create fake accounts to monitor their students' online activity.\n\nAs an R.A., I personally prefer not to be connected to my residents on social media, as I don't want to know about their personal lives unless they choose to share it with me. That way, I can maintain a professional boundary and focus on supporting them when needed.",
            "Honestly, I feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. At the beginning, I thought the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal a long time ago. Now, it's possible we're fighting just to prove our military might, rather than achieving a genuine purpose. I'm also skeptical about the original motivations behind the war, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we effectively conveyed our message in the first few months of the war, and that was a powerful statement in itself. But the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year or more is just ridiculous. It's clear that our purpose has been misinterpreted and distorted over time.\n\nIf our initial intention was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, I believe our reasons have been watered down and misconceived. It seems like we're still fighting just to be at war, rather than seeking a decisive victory or a clear conclusion.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has dragged on for far too long. It's high time for the government to fend for themselves. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose. We should be focusing on our own internal issues, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. These are pressing problems that deserve our attention and financial investment, not the billions we're spending on a foreign war.\n\nIt's a shame that our own citizens are being put in harm's way for a cause that's no longer clear. The money we're spending on this war could be better spent addressing our own problems and improving our own lives. I think that's a much more worthy use of our resources.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm a bit confused about something, so let me ask for clarification on this. I think there was a situation where someone found out about something because someone else looked at their information online.\n\nOkay, so I think I get it. If you put stuff on the internet, it's pretty much out there for anyone to see. For example, on Myspace, you have to make yourself a friend with someone before they can see your profile, but even then, you're giving them permission to see it. So, basically, if you put something online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see it.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's actually a good thing that someone saw that information and was able to prevent something bad from happening. It's tough to balance this, though. On the one hand, we can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent something bad from happening. On the other hand, if they're only looking for people who might be doing something wrong, it feels like discrimination.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is. Maybe it depends on the situation and why they were looking at the person's profile in the first place. Were they just randomly browsing or were they looking for something specific?\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see my stuff. I saw a TV show once that was about how easy it is for people to get information about you online and it freaked me out. It's not that I think it's a huge deal, but it's just weird to think that people can get so much information about you so easily.\n\nFor example, I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they've been able to figure out my screen name and IM me. They know what I look like, where I am during the day, who my friends are, and all sorts of other stuff. It's hard to know what to do because I want to be able to communicate with my friends online, but at the same time, I don't want to make it easy for strangers to find out about me.\n\nThis is a tricky issue because you never really know who's looking at what online. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned students from having Myspace accounts, and I'm not sure how they had the right to do that. Is it a privacy issue or was it something else entirely? I'm not really sure.\n\nThat's about all I can think of on this topic.",
            "I was thinking about the Iraq War, and I have to admit, I feel a bit hypocritical even bringing it up. I'm not sure I'm ready to join the crowd of people who claim they were against it from the start. It's just that, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people everywhere, except within the administration, thought it was a bad idea from the beginning.\n\nIf we take a look at recent polls, it's striking - around 75 to 80% of the global population thinks the war was a mistake. Even in Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view. Furthermore, 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that they should be withdrawn within the year. It's hard to ignore these results.\n\nTo be honest, I think the war has been a disaster from the very beginning. It's not just that the situation is complicated; it's the fundamental cultural differences between the US and the Middle Eastern countries that make it almost impossible to resolve. The idea of bringing democracy to an area where it's not naturally accepted is a flawed one.\n\nI'm not saying Saddam was a good guy; no one is. However, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. And that's exactly what happened. I don't see a clear reason for us to stay in Iraq anymore. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard any convincing arguments.\n\nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a problem with that. But I don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting to note that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective.\n\nIf we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We can at least claim that we're leaving because they wanted us to. And if we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the good guys - to some extent. Not that we'll ever be seen as completely good in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "Honestly, I think gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though - it's more about the specific field of work. I mean, overall, women seem to face more difficulties because of this concept of a \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite supposed equality, many people struggle to work under a female supervisor. This is largely due to societal norms that have been ingrained for so long. In the workplace, women often see opportunities they're qualified for, but the board might not promote them to those positions because it's not common for women to hold upper-management roles. The same thing happens in other fields like fashion or stay-at-home parenting, where men are often stigmatized for choosing to stay home and care for their children.\n\nIt's common for people to look down on stay-at-home dads because society expects men to be the breadwinners. This can be tough on them, especially when they've always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives and helping raise them. Meanwhile, their wives might be the breadwinners, and it's just not socially accepted.\n\nIn the fashion industry, guys are often not taken seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it has to do with the fact that men who are into fashion often don't fit the traditional mold, and people might question their expertise on women's fashion. Depending on the field, there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the US.\n\nChanging this mindset is tough because it's deeply ingrained. We've made significant progress since the 1800s, but it's happening slowly. Women are rising to higher positions, becoming CEOs, and gaining more acceptance in the business world. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, too, as people realize that maybe the female partner does have the better job or wants to be the breadwinner. Similarly, in the fashion industry, people are starting to understand that guys might be listening to their female friends or wives and still have valuable opinions.\n\nTo promote positive change, we need to showcase the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, but we shouldn't push it too hard, or people will resist. We're at a good point now where it's starting to become more accepted, so I'm not sure what else we can do that hasn't already been done. If we move too quickly, people will resist, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from, their education, or even their grammar. For example, a man from a rural area with poor grammar but exceptional intelligence might be looked down upon by others who value better-educated, more polished individuals. It's another example of how discrimination can work across different groups, and I'm not sure what to say about it.",
            "So it seems like they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. What that means is it's no longer a serious crime, but more like a traffic ticket – you get cited, not arrested and charged, which can have some serious repercussions on things like job hunting. \n\nAlthough decriminalizing it takes away some of those harsh penalties, people are still worried about the long-term consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's not as severe. On the other hand, some argue that arresting people for pot possession costs a lot of money – think about all the resources used to catch, book, and court them, not to mention the cost of public defenders and judges. \n\nWhen you consider that many cities are already financially struggling, it's hard to justify the expense. Some places might not want to make that change, even if it frees up funds for more important things like education and social programs. However, in cities where people tend to be more open-minded, it's a different story. In places like Denver, where people are more liberal and open to new ideas, decriminalizing marijuana is seen as a good thing. It can actually bring in more revenue for the city, which can be used for good causes.\n\nIt's not all about making pot freely available, though. There are good reasons to be cautious. If it were fully legal, it could lead to issues like people smoking and driving, which is already a concern. Plus, there's still a stigma around smoking marijuana in many areas. Making it widely available could be awkward for some people.\n\nAs for the comparison between marijuana and alcohol, while both have negative effects, marijuana tends to affect people's lifestyle choices more than their motor skills. However, everyone reacts differently to substances, depending on their personality and ability to practice moderation. It's hard to generalize, but both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of issues.",
            "I think yes because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which can be a good thing. For example, the Catholic Church has been doing things the same way for a long time. While it's great to be connected to the past, it's also essential to be open to change. I believe a lot of Catholics feel they need to attend church every week and adhere to the rules very strictly. However, this sometimes leads to a kind of intolerance towards those who don't follow all the teachings or come from other faiths.\n\nFor instance, when my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, they were refused because my dad was an Episcopalian. This seems hypocritical to me, as the Catholic Church teaches us to love and accept others, but in practice, it doesn't always follow this principle. I think the Catholic Church's rules and practices often conflict. They can be outdated, but the Church still sticks to them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to get married would necessarily make a difference in terms of reducing pedophilic behavior. People who abuse children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship altogether. Allowing priests to be married might not alter their behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to get married would be a solution to the problem of child abuse within the Church. Such behavior is likely to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to figure this out - I haven't really made up my mind on it yet. It's tough because there's a fine line between keeping church and state separate and figuring out what marriage really means. It's a tricky topic because it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone.\n\nI think this is one of the most challenging issues we're facing today. Considering marriage as a sacrament, the government shouldn't give special treatment or tax breaks just because someone's been baptized. If two people are in a civil union, I believe the government should just recognize it for what it is - two people coming together.\n\nIt's not about whether the marriage is \"sacred\" or whatever; it's about two people being together. The separation of church and state should remain intact. The fact that some people want to restrict gay marriage is just the same as any other civil union - two people getting together.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is completely unnecessary. It's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution. Defining or banning gay marriage just isn't that important, so why should it be a constitutional amendment?\n\nIn my opinion, it's just not worth altering the constitution for. It's as simple as that.",
            "To be honest, I've always had mixed feelings about homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. However, knowing many gay friends has made me think differently about the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't think it's something that should be a national issue, but rather something each state should decide for itself.\n\nLiving in a democratic state means you're part of a community that generally supports a particular stance on issues like gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state where gay marriage is accepted, it's hard to argue with the decision. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, should have the same opportunities, and that's why I think each state should have the freedom to decide on gay marriage.\n\nI already kind of answered that, but to clarify, I don't think President Bush should have the authority to ban gay marriage nationwide. It's up to individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves, and I don't think the president should impose his views on the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his decision to make. Some things should be left up to individual states, and besides, he'll be out of office soon anyway. If a new president wants to lift the ban, it will just go back and forth. Ultimately, it's up to each state to decide what works best for them. They're the ones who will have to live with the consequences.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm making sense, but that's my two cents on the issue.",
            "Honestly, I don't think so. \n\nLet me put it this way... If Myspace is a public platform, it's only logical that what's posted there can be seen by anyone, including school officials. I mean, if you post something online, you have to consider the possibility that it'll be seen by a wider audience. In this case, the school officials were just doing their job to keep the school a safe environment. \n\nThink about it, if they're lurking on Myspace just to catch students engaging in activities that aren't allowed, that's a different story. But if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, then I think that's perfectly fine. I mean, as long as it's done to keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's like when parents drop off their kids at school, they expect it to be a safe place. And that's exactly what school officials were doing - making sure the school is a safe environment. I've talked to a teacher about this, and they said it's their responsibility to ensure the school is secure, especially after things like the Columbine shooting. They were just doing drills and stuff to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nSo, in this case, I think the school officials were just doing their job to make the school a safer place. And if that means monitoring Myspace, then so be it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you post something on Myspace, you have to be prepared for the fact that it could be seen by anyone. And once it's online, it's hard to take it back. \n\nI mean, even if you're just joking around with friends, there's a risk that something you say could get back to the wrong people. It's just something to be aware of when you're posting online.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I don't think it was an invasion of privacy. If school officials are monitoring Myspace to keep students safe, then that's their job. And if they're doing it to prevent something bad from happening, then I think that's perfectly okay.",
            "Honestly, I have to admit that my perspective on the war has changed over time. Initially, I was really passionate about it because it was a direct response to the 9/11 attacks, which personally affected me. I thought we should strike back and show the world that we wouldn't tolerate such atrocities. However, as time went on, I started to realize that we didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to a lot of problems. I think we overlooked the fact that the people in that region are complex and deeply entrenched in their own conflicts, and we couldn't just impose our will on them.\n\nTo be frank, I'm not sure I care about what's happening over there anymore. It's like they're fighting among themselves, and we're just getting in the way. I don't think our presence is making a significant difference, and I'm starting to think that we should just leave and let them sort out their own problems. War is a different beast for them than it is for us, and I'm not convinced that they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out.\n\nI think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. We went in without a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve, and it's been a disaster. I'm not convinced that we're making progress, and I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. Eventually, we'll leave, and the situation will collapse. We're doing more harm to ourselves by staying in the conflict than good.\n\nLooking back, I think we were caught up in the hype and didn't think things through. We wanted to respond to 9/11, and President Bush took it upon himself to declare war on Iraq. At the time, I understood his motivations, but I think we could have handled it differently. We should have taken the time to develop a clear plan and strategy for rebuilding the country, rather than just rushing in with a bunch of guns and bombs.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think we're in a position to make a significant difference in the region. The people there have their own ways and cultures, and we can't change that. I think we should acknowledge that and just leave them to sort out their own problems. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying in the conflict forever. It's time for us to move on and let them take care of themselves."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few areas. Their views on certain issues are not really in tune with the times, and that's one reason why they're losing followers. For instance, they have strong opinions on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, but these views seem a bit outdated. If the Church adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these issues, and that's causing them to lose faith. If you're pro-choice on abortion or support gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable following a Church that views these things as wrong. It's the same with other issues where the Church's views clash with your own. \n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's not like having a family life would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church. I mean, just because priests are married to God doesn't mean they can't have a life outside of their vocation. Everyone else has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?\n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to devote their entire lives to their work, with no personal life. I think it would be more realistic and healthy for them to have both a career and a family. It's not like they're asking for the world; they just want a bit of balance in their lives.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for who they are. It doesn't make sense to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a matter of choice; they're just born with their orientation. I'm not sure I've thought it through, but it does seem wrong to me that some people are denied the right to marry because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems that being gay isn't something people choose; it's just how they are. I was born straight, and people are born with different orientations, so it's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue; it's not a legal or moral issue, but rather a personal one. I don't think it's fair to judge or punish people for who they are.\n\nIt's hard for me to put into words, but I think the federal government should stay out of it. This isn't a matter of national security or morality; it's just a personal aspect of people's lives. They shouldn't have the right to interfere or judge people based on their sexual orientation. It's who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but that's just not the case. It's apples and oranges; they're two different things with different aspects.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin - heads and tails are never going to be the same, but they're still part of the same coin. Same-sex couples have the same basic rights as straight couples, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick, and they can't visit because they're not technically considered family. It's a pretty silly reason to deny someone's partner the right to be with them in a time of need.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as straight couples. At the end of the day, it's just a relationship - the same thing. Where people get hung up is on the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they're asking for a marriage certificate from the government. If you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as straight couples, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. The real issue is that some people are uncomfortable with the idea of same-sex relationships, and that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights.\n\nPeople worry about the impact on children, but that's a complex issue. Some people think that children of same-sex couples will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, but that's just not true. Children are influenced by their parents' values and parenting skills, not their orientation. And just like straight couples, gay couples can be good parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment against it should be repealed. President Bush has his own views on gay marriage, which are based on his religious beliefs, but that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights. The government should be more inclusive and not impose its own moral views on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not supported by research, and people should listen to experts, not just their opinions or cultural norms. If we listened to institutions that have actually studied these issues, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have some beneficial properties. I mean, as far as making it available to the public, I'm absolutely against it. I don't think that's a good idea. But, for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. If we dismiss something just because it's not allowed, that's not fair. There are plenty of controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, that we use all the time in the pharmacy because they're beneficial, even though they're not exactly legal. We shouldn't be denying the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it. I think we should be embracing its potential benefits.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol. I mean, if you overuse marijuana, it can have negative consequences, just like with alcohol. It's a tough issue. I think the key is to integrate it gradually, rather than making it legal all at once. If we did that, it might get abused, but if we can first remove the negative image associated with marijuana, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nYou see, people have this really bad perception of marijuana because it's an illicit substance. But, it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. I think if we can change the way people view marijuana, they might be more likely to use it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I've noticed this firsthand, especially when I attend church services. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday and dress up in matching outfits, including cute dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal, and I felt like it was a special occasion. However, as I've grown older, the church has started to adapt to the changing times. They've even introduced a 30-minute mass for teenagers, which has become more casual. People now wear jeans and khakis, even during morning masses, which was previously a time for more formal attire.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift in the overall atmosphere. The church I'm familiar with has become more relaxed, and it's not as formal as it used to be. I'm not aware of the church's politics, but I think this is a good thing.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who become pedophiles regardless of their marital status, and their attraction to young children is not something that can be altered by marriage or other external factors. I think it's a personal choice to become a priest, and if someone wants to be married while practicing their faith, they might consider a different denomination that allows it, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church. I don't think the church's stance on marriage or celibacy is the root cause of the problem.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is largely determined by genetics. People are born with certain inclinations, and it's not something that can be changed through upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some instances may be influenced by environmental factors, I believe that genetics play a significant role. Trying to hide or suppress these tendencies through marriage or other means is unlikely to be effective in the long run. If the church was aware of these situations and chose to cover them up, that's unacceptable, but I don't think they could have prevented the problem in the first place.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point, but I appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective on this sensitive issue.",
            "Honestly, I initially agreed with the premise, but I have to admit that the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was a really volatile time, and I think we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext to address some other issues that were already on the table. The Bush administration was quick to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false. That really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war has always been a sensitive topic for me.\n\nTo me, it seems like the Bush administration has been flagrantly lying to the American people, and they've yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented that infamous UN speech, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. It's like they're trying to get away with malfeasance in office, which I think is a serious offense that should be impeachable. They seem to have this disregard for the constitution and have been trying to undermine it since 9/11, at least.\n\nI think they came into office with a predetermined plan to go to war, and the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his dad's administration. He might have been hoping to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nWhile I think it's time to get out of Iraq, I'm aware that withdrawing now could lead to chaos and more deaths as the country teeters on the brink of civil war. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, might not be the best idea either, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create more problems in the long run.\n\nThe Iraqi government seems ineffective, and from what I've seen, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, especially with parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's holding sway. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.",
            "You know, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq, and I'm not sure where I stand on it. To be honest, it's all kind of confusing, but I guess my main feeling is that it's pointless, or at least it doesn't feel like it's going anywhere. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, so it's hard to really understand what's going on.\n\nI think it was kind of like a response to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being involved. But now, it feels like we're just stuck there trying to build democracy, which is a long-term goal, and it's hard to see how it's actually making things better. Plus, we're also interested in getting oil from them, which doesn't seem like a good reason to be there.\n\nThe thing is, if we leave, Iraq will be upset, but if we stay, it's going to take forever to build a stable democracy, and it's going to be hard to leave without messing things up even more. And if we keep trying to impose our values on them, it's going to create more problems, like more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida.\n\nIt's all really complicated, and I don't know what the best solution is. I guess I'm just worried that it's going to drag on for years and years, and it's not going to end well. That's pretty much my take on it.\n\nAs for calling it a war, I don't think that's even accurate. I mean, it wasn't declared by Congress, so it doesn't feel like a real war to me. And it's hard to justify staying there when it's causing so much suffering and destruction.\n\nBut at the same time, I know there are families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I feel for them. It's hard to know what to do, because I don't want to see anyone get hurt, but I also don't want us to be stuck in a situation that's not making things better.\n\nI guess that's my take on it. It's all just really complicated, and I don't know what the answer is.",
            "Honestly, I think it's unfair for a government to make laws based on religious beliefs. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle in the constitution, and it's clearly stated that the government should not interfere with church matters. I believe that trying to enforce laws based on one church's views would be a direct contradiction to this principle.\n\nIt seems to me that those pushing for a ban on a certain issue are essentially favoring one church over others. For example, most Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, but there are some exceptions. However, I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't allow.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for religious tolerance and freedom. Given that an amendment is being proposed, I think it's misguided and contradictory to the existing laws. It would be one of the few amendments intended to restrict individuals rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs, and it's unfair to impose his views on others. Every religion should have the freedom to make its own decisions, and it's up to the churches to decide what's right for them, not the government.\n\nI don't see any solid reason for the amendment, other than personal opinions. It's not clear how it would impact the economy or society in a positive way. In fact, it might even have a beneficial effect by promoting a more open and accepting society. I think I've said all I need to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq has left me with many unanswered questions. I think the US government may not have been entirely honest with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. They attempted to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks, which didn't necessarily have a direct connection. This emotional manipulation of the public's sentiment may have contributed to the invasion in 2003. As someone who's generally against going to war, especially preemptive strikes, I think the parallels between the Iraq war and the Vietnam War are striking. The US government seemed to disregard the lessons learned from past mistakes, resulting in a tremendous loss of American lives.\n\nThe invasion and removal of the Iraqi government were poorly planned, and the US didn't anticipate the chaos and power vacuum that would follow. They're now trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their attempts in Vietnam to oust Communists and install democracy. However, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process, not a quick, clear victory.\n\nIt's almost impossible to win against an entire nation's population when fighting insurgents, as opposed to a conventional army. I think the government underestimated the difficulty of this task and didn't prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. It's been almost a decade since the invasion, and we're still there, struggling to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to secure their own country. I believe the government has been naive in thinking this would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and arduous process, with many struggles and civil wars along the way. The US government made it seem like establishing democracy in Iraq would be relatively easy, which was a misleading message. It's a difficult decision to make, especially considering the long-term commitment required to establish a stable government.\n\nThe idea of abandoning Iraq now, after removing their government and disrupting their way of life, is a moral dilemma. We should try to see this through, but on the other hand, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify the risks involved. It seems to me that the real reason for invading Iraq was to control its oil resources, rather than to spread democracy. The lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a key factor in the decision to invade, yet countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, weren't targeted.\n\nI just hope the war in Iraq ends soon and that there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, it's unlikely to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and state my opinion on gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. To be honest, I always have been. I think it comes down to personal preference, and it's been proven that it's not just a matter of environment, but also biology. So, it's unfair to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI believe it's inhumane to do so, and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. In my opinion, the government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal decision that affects individuals and their families, not the state.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family would. They walk their dogs, interact with their neighbors, and go about their daily lives just like everyone else. It's not right that President Bush thinks he can interpret what marriage means and dictate it to everyone else.\n\nI think it's ridiculous when you consider that research has shown that there may be a biological component to being gay, rather than it being a product of environment or upbringing. It's not just about the number of siblings you have or the presence of a father figure - there are actual chemical factors at play.\n\nIf a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately without anyone's knowledge, but if a same-sex couple wants to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "I mean, seriously, when you post something online, it's a public platform. It's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. You put something out there, and it's going to influence how people perceive you. Talking about violent or disturbing topics can spark people's reactions, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, they'll see that bulletin. It's not the school that receives the bulletin; someone else shares it, and they have to take action. They can't just ignore it, or who knows, something bad might happen, and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's tough to know what's serious and what's just a joke. Take the incident we had on campus, for instance. It might have been a sociology experiment gone wrong or a genuine threat. Either way, when people heard about it, they were worried. When you share stuff online, there's no invasion of privacy; if you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. It's not like you can dictate how others perceive you.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media platforms or snoop through their profiles. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously. It's not the same as monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IMs. If a teacher creates a fake account to befriend students, that's crossing a line. I wouldn't do that as an R.A. because I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially if they're posting pictures of themselves having fun. That's not my concern, and I shouldn't have to deal with it.",
            "I feel that the war has been dragging on for too long. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble goal. However, it seems that we've lost sight of this purpose and are now just going through the motions to prove our strength as a superpower. I also wonder if the original motivation was tainted by George Bush's personal vendetta with Saddam Hussein, given his father's previous conflicts with him. If the war was meant to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that personal agendas were involved.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the first few months of the war, and that was a significant statement in itself. But continuing to fight for over a year or multiple years is just too prolonged. If our goal was to free a country from tyranny, that's a noble purpose, but I think our reasoning has been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting.\n\nI believe it's time for us to bring this war to an end. Our government officials should be able to fend for themselves by now. We're wasting billions of dollars on a war that's been dragging on for too long, while we have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare. It's time to redirect that money towards our own problems, rather than continuing to hemorrhage it in a foreign conflict that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe money being spent on war could be better used to fund essential public services, like education, healthcare, and public transportation. The fact that our citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost its way is unacceptable. I think that's the main issue here.",
            "I was wondering if you could clarify something for me. I was thinking about this situation where someone actually prevented a potentially bad situation from happening because they found out about it online. Apparently, it was because someone had discovered the information on a social media website like Myspace.\n\nOkay, so, I was thinking, if you post something online, it's pretty much public information, right? On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends with them, you're basically giving them permission to see your stuff. It's kind of like that when you put anything online, you're kind of open to everyone seeing it.\n\nI have to admit, I think it's actually good that someone was able to see that information and prevent something bad from happening. But, on the other hand, it's a tough situation because you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent bad things from happening. That would be like some kind of profiling, which isn't fair. But, at the same time, if someone is looking for information and they happen to stumble upon something that indicates someone is planning something bad, it's a different story.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's kind of weird to think about how much information is out there about you online, and how easily someone can access it. I've heard stories about people being able to find out all sorts of personal information about people online, which is pretty scary. For example, I saw a TV show about someone who was able to find out a girl's screen name and start talking to her on instant messenger, and she ended up meeting with him. It's crazy to think about how easily that can happen.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because, on the one hand, you want to be able to connect with your friends online, but on the other hand, you don't want to put yourself out there for everyone to see. I've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, that's kind of the point of having social media, right? It's a delicate balance.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she mentioned that her high school actually banned Myspace, which seemed weird to me. I'm not sure how they had the right to do that, and it's not really a privacy issue, but it's still kind of strange.\n\nThat's my take on it, I guess.",
            "I don't know how to start this but I guess I should mention the Iraq War one more time. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up, but I was against it from the start, and I'm not sure why it's not that important anymore. Everyone's just kind of accepted that it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who won't admit they were wrong. It's clear when you look at the polls - in the US, Iraq, and globally, around 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops think it was a dumb idea and we should leave within a year. I just think it's been a disaster from the start, and now it's hard to see how we can get out without causing another mess. \n\nIt's all about the huge cultural gap between the US and the Middle East. I don't think we can impose democracy on a place where it's not wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but we have to weigh the pros and cons before invading. It was clear that we'd just create a disaster, like quicksand. I don't really see a reason for us to stay anymore - I haven't heard any legitimate reasons from the administration that make sense to me. If they want to leave gradually, I'm okay with that, but I just don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, it's worth listening to their opinions. At least if we ask and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. It would be better if we were seen as trying to help, rather than just being there for our own reasons.",
            "You know, I really think there's still a lot of gender bias in the United States. I mean, it's not just a women's issue, but it's more prevalent in certain industries, like the ones we work in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where people have a hard time accepting that women can be in charge or have authority. It's just how society has been conditioned for so long. In the workplace, women often have the qualifications and skills, but they're not always promoted to the top positions because people are used to seeing men in those roles.\n\nIt's not just women, though, because men can face prejudice too, especially when it comes to things like stay-at-home parenting. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and raise their kids, like it's not what men are supposed to do. They should be the breadwinners, right? But sometimes that's not what works best for the family, and it can be really tough on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's a bit different, but there's still a problem. People might not take guys who are into fashion seriously, especially if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's like, if you're a guy who likes fashion, people might think you're not really understanding what women go through. They might not take your opinions seriously because you're not part of the \"typical\" male style.\n\nAnyway, I feel like gender bias is a big issue, and it's hard to change because people have a set way of thinking. We've come a long way, but it's still slow going. I think if we keep working at the pace we are now, with women getting more into leadership positions and being accepted in business, it'll happen eventually. People will start to realize that men can be stay-at-home dads too, and that guys can be into fashion and still be taken seriously.\n\nI guess the key is to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped, but not be pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now where people are starting to get it. We've made progress, and change takes time, so I'm not sure what more we can do at this point.\n\nOh, and it's not just men and women – people can be biased against each other depending on their background, education, and even where they're from. Like, if someone's not from a city, they might get looked down on because of their grammar or accent. It's a complex issue, but I think it's worth talking about.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. That means it got bumped down from a serious offense to more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested. I think this can be a good thing, as it reduces the harsh consequences people face from a marijuana charge, especially for jobs and other important stuff. However, it's worth noting that even if it's decriminalized, there are still potential long-term effects to worry about. On the other hand, some argue that it's costly to arrest and process people for marijuana possession, and that the money saved could be better spent on other important things. \n\nIn places with a more open-minded attitude, like Denver, it seems like decriminalization has worked out well, allowing them to free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. Of course, there are still valid concerns about marijuana being available everywhere, and some people worry about the impact on society and individual behavior. I'm not sure how I feel about full legalization, but I do think it's an issue with complex pros and cons. For example, if it were fully legalized, it might lead to more people smoking and driving, which would be a problem. Plus, some people are still uncomfortable with the idea of marijuana being out in the open. In my opinion, alcohol has more significant effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more profound impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, it's hard to make generalizations about substances because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. So, it's a tough issue to tackle.",
            "To be honest, I agree \nBecause \nQuite frankly, many things they do are steeped in tradition \nThings that have been done in a very specific way for a long time \nAnd \nIt's great to have roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe in regular church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel that the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the rules precisely \nAnd \nThey often don't accept people who aren't perfectly devout Catholics, nor those from other faiths \nFor instance \nMy parents were a Catholic and an Episcopalian, and they weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith \n\nWhich \nIsn't really \nAbout being tolerant of other beliefs \nWe've always been taught to \nLove others, a fundamental Catholic principle \nHowever, it seems hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while excluding others \nThat's a major issue with some Catholic doctrine and practice \nIt's outdated, but they continue to follow it anyway \n\nHonestly, I don't think that would necessarily make a difference \nPersonally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to marry \nBut \nI don't think that would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior \nIt's a different issue altogether \nSo, I'm not sure if that would be an issue \n\nTo be honest, people who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status \nChildren are different from spouses, so \nIf someone is inclined to harm children, they probably would do it regardless of whether they're married \nAllowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents, as they would likely happen anyway \n\nNo, I don't think so",
            "Alright, I don't know what I think about this one... I'm still trying to make up my mind. It's a really tricky topic, and I'm not sure if either side is entirely right or wrong. The thing is, separating church and state can be tough, and defining marriage is even harder. It's a whole can of worms, and it's hard to resolve it without offending anyone.\n\nThe thing is, what is marriage? Is it a sacrament, or is it just a civil union? If it's a sacrament, then the government shouldn't really care about it. I mean, people who are baptized get tax breaks and other benefits, so why not married people too? And if you're married, it's just a civil union, right? Two people coming together, living together, and sharing their lives.\n\nBut then there's gay marriage. It's just two people, right? They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else. If all the states can agree on this, then it should be a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Come on, that's just not necessary. It's not a big enough deal to warrant amending the constitution.\n\nIt's just a matter of defining what marriage is and letting people live their lives. It's not worth messing with the constitution over. So, to answer your question, I don't have a clear stance on this one yet. I need some more time to think about it.",
            "Alright, I'll be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and when it comes to homosexuality, it's a bit of a complicated issue for me. On one hand, I have many gay friends and I care about them deeply, but on the other hand, I'm not entirely in agreement with the lifestyle. However, I strongly believe that it should be legalized and not made a national issue. Instead, I think it should be up to each individual state to decide for themselves. \n\nI mean, we have democratic and republican states, and it's only natural that democratic states would be more open to gay marriage. If you live in a state that leans one way or the other, I think you should respect the decision of that state. After all, you chose to live there, so it's only fair that you accept the values and laws that come with it. I believe that everyone, regardless of orientation, deserves equal opportunities, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage. \n\nAs for the current president's stance on the issue, I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't have the power to dictate how each one runs itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, and this is one of them. Plus, his term is limited, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's the states that'll have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I think this is a matter that should be left to the states, not the federal government.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor what students post online. I mean, Myspace is a public platform, after all. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that others, including school officials, might see it. Even if you're not posting under the school's name, there's nothing stopping them from accessing it from their own homes. With school safety being a top priority, I think it's reasonable for officials to keep an eye out for content that might indicate students are engaging in risky behavior, like underage drinking or smoking. \n\nNow, I'm not saying it's cool for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students and get them in trouble. But if they're using online monitoring as a tool to prevent harm and keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's kind of like when parents drop off their kids at school and expect it to be a safe environment - they want to know that the school is taking steps to prevent problems like bullying or violence. I've discussed this with a teacher before, and they told me that schools have to take proactive measures to ensure student safety, like lockdown drills and emergency preparedness. It's all about making the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nI know some people might see this as an invasion of privacy, but I don't think it's unreasonable for schools to be vigilant about student safety. After all, everything you post online can come back to haunt you, and I'd rather err on the side of caution. I mean, think about it - if you do something questionable as a college student, it can come back to bite you years later when you're a successful person. \n\nSo yeah, I think it's a public thing, and if school officials are using online monitoring to keep students safe, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Of course, it's not about going on the internet just to catch students - it's about using any available tools to prevent harm and make the school a better place. That's basically my take on it.",
            "Honestly, I've had a change of heart about the war. At first, I supported it because I was deeply affected by the events of 9/11 and wanted to see the perpetrators brought to justice. I was so caught up in my emotions that I didn't think through the long-term consequences. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, and I think that was a huge mistake. It's clear that our actions backfired, and I'm now strongly against the war.\n\nIn my opinion, the people we're fighting don't care about us as long as they're fighting among themselves. It's pointless for us to be over there, trying to impose our will on them when they can't even get along with each other. Our presence in their country has only caused more problems, and I've come to realize that I just don't care what happens over there.\n\nI sometimes wonder if they're even capable of being human, given their brutal approach to war. It seems like they're more interested in driving us out than in improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them sort out their own issues.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war in a state of emotional frenzy, driven by a desire for revenge. We weren't thinking clearly about the potential consequences or how the Iraqis would react to our presence. We were more focused on seeking payback than on creating a better future for them.\n\nIn retrospect, I think President Bush should have had a clearer plan and a more rational approach. We couldn't just ignore the threat posed by Iraq and expect everything to go back to normal. However, I believe we could have achieved more if we had a better strategy and a stronger understanding of what we were trying to accomplish.\n\nThe lack of unity and clear goals on our part only made things worse, and I think that's a crucial lesson we should learn from this experience. We can't change the Iraqi people; they're going to be who they are, and it's time for us to accept that.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're making enough progress, and I believe it's time for us to leave. Once we do, the country will likely collapse, and we'll be no better off than we are now. We can't stay in Iraq forever, and I think we're causing more harm to ourselves than good by staying."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few areas. Their views on certain issues are not really in tune with the times, and that's one reason why they're losing followers. For instance, they have strong opinions on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, but these views seem a bit outdated. If the Church adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these issues, and that's causing them to lose faith. If you're pro-choice on abortion or support gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable following a Church that views these things as wrong. It's the same with other issues where the Church's views clash with your own. \n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's not like having a family life would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church. I mean, just because priests are married to God doesn't mean they can't have a life outside of their vocation. Everyone else has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?\n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to devote their entire lives to their work, with no personal life. I think it would be more realistic and healthy for them to have both a career and a family. It's not like they're asking for the world; they just want a bit of balance in their lives.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for who they are. It doesn't make sense to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a matter of choice; they're just born with their orientation. I'm not sure I've thought it through, but it does seem wrong to me that some people are denied the right to marry because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems that being gay isn't something people choose; it's just how they are. I was born straight, and people are born with different orientations, so it's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue; it's not a legal or moral issue, but rather a personal one. I don't think it's fair to judge or punish people for who they are.\n\nIt's hard for me to put into words, but I think the federal government should stay out of it. This isn't a matter of national security or morality; it's just a personal aspect of people's lives. They shouldn't have the right to interfere or judge people based on their sexual orientation. It's who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but that's just not the case. It's apples and oranges; they're two different things with different aspects.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin - heads and tails are never going to be the same, but they're still part of the same coin. Same-sex couples have the same basic rights as straight couples, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick, and they can't visit because they're not technically considered family. It's a pretty silly reason to deny someone's partner the right to be with them in a time of need.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as straight couples. At the end of the day, it's just a relationship - the same thing. Where people get hung up is on the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they're asking for a marriage certificate from the government. If you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as straight couples, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. The real issue is that some people are uncomfortable with the idea of same-sex relationships, and that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights.\n\nPeople worry about the impact on children, but that's a complex issue. Some people think that children of same-sex couples will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, but that's just not true. Children are influenced by their parents' values and parenting skills, not their orientation. And just like straight couples, gay couples can be good parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment against it should be repealed. President Bush has his own views on gay marriage, which are based on his religious beliefs, but that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights. The government should be more inclusive and not impose its own moral views on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not supported by research, and people should listen to experts, not just their opinions or cultural norms. If we listened to institutions that have actually studied these issues, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have some beneficial properties. I mean, as far as making it available to the public, I'm absolutely against it. I don't think that's a good idea. But, for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. If we dismiss something just because it's not allowed, that's not fair. There are plenty of controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, that we use all the time in the pharmacy because they're beneficial, even though they're not exactly legal. We shouldn't be denying the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it. I think we should be embracing its potential benefits.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol. I mean, if you overuse marijuana, it can have negative consequences, just like with alcohol. It's a tough issue. I think the key is to integrate it gradually, rather than making it legal all at once. If we did that, it might get abused, but if we can first remove the negative image associated with marijuana, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nYou see, people have this really bad perception of marijuana because it's an illicit substance. But, it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. I think if we can change the way people view marijuana, they might be more likely to use it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I've noticed this firsthand, especially when I attend church services. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday and dress up in matching outfits, including cute dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal, and I felt like it was a special occasion. However, as I've grown older, the church has started to adapt to the changing times. They've even introduced a 30-minute mass for teenagers, which has become more casual. People now wear jeans and khakis, even during morning masses, which was previously a time for more formal attire.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift in the overall atmosphere. The church I'm familiar with has become more relaxed, and it's not as formal as it used to be. I'm not aware of the church's politics, but I think this is a good thing.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who become pedophiles regardless of their marital status, and their attraction to young children is not something that can be altered by marriage or other external factors. I think it's a personal choice to become a priest, and if someone wants to be married while practicing their faith, they might consider a different denomination that allows it, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church. I don't think the church's stance on marriage or celibacy is the root cause of the problem.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is largely determined by genetics. People are born with certain inclinations, and it's not something that can be changed through upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some instances may be influenced by environmental factors, I believe that genetics play a significant role. Trying to hide or suppress these tendencies through marriage or other means is unlikely to be effective in the long run. If the church was aware of these situations and chose to cover them up, that's unacceptable, but I don't think they could have prevented the problem in the first place.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point, but I appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective on this sensitive issue.",
            "Honestly, I initially agreed with the premise, but I have to admit that the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was a really volatile time, and I think we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext to address some other issues that were already on the table. The Bush administration was quick to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false. That really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war has always been a sensitive topic for me.\n\nTo me, it seems like the Bush administration has been flagrantly lying to the American people, and they've yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented that infamous UN speech, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. It's like they're trying to get away with malfeasance in office, which I think is a serious offense that should be impeachable. They seem to have this disregard for the constitution and have been trying to undermine it since 9/11, at least.\n\nI think they came into office with a predetermined plan to go to war, and the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his dad's administration. He might have been hoping to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nWhile I think it's time to get out of Iraq, I'm aware that withdrawing now could lead to chaos and more deaths as the country teeters on the brink of civil war. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, might not be the best idea either, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create more problems in the long run.\n\nThe Iraqi government seems ineffective, and from what I've seen, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, especially with parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's holding sway. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.",
            "You know, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq, and I'm not sure where I stand on it. To be honest, it's all kind of confusing, but I guess my main feeling is that it's pointless, or at least it doesn't feel like it's going anywhere. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, so it's hard to really understand what's going on.\n\nI think it was kind of like a response to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being involved. But now, it feels like we're just stuck there trying to build democracy, which is a long-term goal, and it's hard to see how it's actually making things better. Plus, we're also interested in getting oil from them, which doesn't seem like a good reason to be there.\n\nThe thing is, if we leave, Iraq will be upset, but if we stay, it's going to take forever to build a stable democracy, and it's going to be hard to leave without messing things up even more. And if we keep trying to impose our values on them, it's going to create more problems, like more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida.\n\nIt's all really complicated, and I don't know what the best solution is. I guess I'm just worried that it's going to drag on for years and years, and it's not going to end well. That's pretty much my take on it.\n\nAs for calling it a war, I don't think that's even accurate. I mean, it wasn't declared by Congress, so it doesn't feel like a real war to me. And it's hard to justify staying there when it's causing so much suffering and destruction.\n\nBut at the same time, I know there are families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I feel for them. It's hard to know what to do, because I don't want to see anyone get hurt, but I also don't want us to be stuck in a situation that's not making things better.\n\nI guess that's my take on it. It's all just really complicated, and I don't know what the answer is.",
            "Honestly, I think it's unfair for a government to make laws based on religious beliefs. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle in the constitution, and it's clearly stated that the government should not interfere with church matters. I believe that trying to enforce laws based on one church's views would be a direct contradiction to this principle.\n\nIt seems to me that those pushing for a ban on a certain issue are essentially favoring one church over others. For example, most Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, but there are some exceptions. However, I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't allow.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for religious tolerance and freedom. Given that an amendment is being proposed, I think it's misguided and contradictory to the existing laws. It would be one of the few amendments intended to restrict individuals rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs, and it's unfair to impose his views on others. Every religion should have the freedom to make its own decisions, and it's up to the churches to decide what's right for them, not the government.\n\nI don't see any solid reason for the amendment, other than personal opinions. It's not clear how it would impact the economy or society in a positive way. In fact, it might even have a beneficial effect by promoting a more open and accepting society. I think I've said all I need to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq has left me with many unanswered questions. I think the US government may not have been entirely honest with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. They attempted to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks, which didn't necessarily have a direct connection. This emotional manipulation of the public's sentiment may have contributed to the invasion in 2003. As someone who's generally against going to war, especially preemptive strikes, I think the parallels between the Iraq war and the Vietnam War are striking. The US government seemed to disregard the lessons learned from past mistakes, resulting in a tremendous loss of American lives.\n\nThe invasion and removal of the Iraqi government were poorly planned, and the US didn't anticipate the chaos and power vacuum that would follow. They're now trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their attempts in Vietnam to oust Communists and install democracy. However, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process, not a quick, clear victory.\n\nIt's almost impossible to win against an entire nation's population when fighting insurgents, as opposed to a conventional army. I think the government underestimated the difficulty of this task and didn't prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. It's been almost a decade since the invasion, and we're still there, struggling to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to secure their own country. I believe the government has been naive in thinking this would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and arduous process, with many struggles and civil wars along the way. The US government made it seem like establishing democracy in Iraq would be relatively easy, which was a misleading message. It's a difficult decision to make, especially considering the long-term commitment required to establish a stable government.\n\nThe idea of abandoning Iraq now, after removing their government and disrupting their way of life, is a moral dilemma. We should try to see this through, but on the other hand, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify the risks involved. It seems to me that the real reason for invading Iraq was to control its oil resources, rather than to spread democracy. The lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a key factor in the decision to invade, yet countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, weren't targeted.\n\nI just hope the war in Iraq ends soon and that there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, it's unlikely to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and state my opinion on gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. To be honest, I always have been. I think it comes down to personal preference, and it's been proven that it's not just a matter of environment, but also biology. So, it's unfair to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI believe it's inhumane to do so, and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. In my opinion, the government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal decision that affects individuals and their families, not the state.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family would. They walk their dogs, interact with their neighbors, and go about their daily lives just like everyone else. It's not right that President Bush thinks he can interpret what marriage means and dictate it to everyone else.\n\nI think it's ridiculous when you consider that research has shown that there may be a biological component to being gay, rather than it being a product of environment or upbringing. It's not just about the number of siblings you have or the presence of a father figure - there are actual chemical factors at play.\n\nIf a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately without anyone's knowledge, but if a same-sex couple wants to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "I mean, seriously, when you post something online, it's a public platform. It's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. You put something out there, and it's going to influence how people perceive you. Talking about violent or disturbing topics can spark people's reactions, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, they'll see that bulletin. It's not the school that receives the bulletin; someone else shares it, and they have to take action. They can't just ignore it, or who knows, something bad might happen, and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's tough to know what's serious and what's just a joke. Take the incident we had on campus, for instance. It might have been a sociology experiment gone wrong or a genuine threat. Either way, when people heard about it, they were worried. When you share stuff online, there's no invasion of privacy; if you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. It's not like you can dictate how others perceive you.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media platforms or snoop through their profiles. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously. It's not the same as monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IMs. If a teacher creates a fake account to befriend students, that's crossing a line. I wouldn't do that as an R.A. because I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially if they're posting pictures of themselves having fun. That's not my concern, and I shouldn't have to deal with it.",
            "I feel that the war has been dragging on for too long. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble goal. However, it seems that we've lost sight of this purpose and are now just going through the motions to prove our strength as a superpower. I also wonder if the original motivation was tainted by George Bush's personal vendetta with Saddam Hussein, given his father's previous conflicts with him. If the war was meant to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that personal agendas were involved.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the first few months of the war, and that was a significant statement in itself. But continuing to fight for over a year or multiple years is just too prolonged. If our goal was to free a country from tyranny, that's a noble purpose, but I think our reasoning has been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting.\n\nI believe it's time for us to bring this war to an end. Our government officials should be able to fend for themselves by now. We're wasting billions of dollars on a war that's been dragging on for too long, while we have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare. It's time to redirect that money towards our own problems, rather than continuing to hemorrhage it in a foreign conflict that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe money being spent on war could be better used to fund essential public services, like education, healthcare, and public transportation. The fact that our citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost its way is unacceptable. I think that's the main issue here.",
            "I was wondering if you could clarify something for me. I was thinking about this situation where someone actually prevented a potentially bad situation from happening because they found out about it online. Apparently, it was because someone had discovered the information on a social media website like Myspace.\n\nOkay, so, I was thinking, if you post something online, it's pretty much public information, right? On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends with them, you're basically giving them permission to see your stuff. It's kind of like that when you put anything online, you're kind of open to everyone seeing it.\n\nI have to admit, I think it's actually good that someone was able to see that information and prevent something bad from happening. But, on the other hand, it's a tough situation because you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent bad things from happening. That would be like some kind of profiling, which isn't fair. But, at the same time, if someone is looking for information and they happen to stumble upon something that indicates someone is planning something bad, it's a different story.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's kind of weird to think about how much information is out there about you online, and how easily someone can access it. I've heard stories about people being able to find out all sorts of personal information about people online, which is pretty scary. For example, I saw a TV show about someone who was able to find out a girl's screen name and start talking to her on instant messenger, and she ended up meeting with him. It's crazy to think about how easily that can happen.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because, on the one hand, you want to be able to connect with your friends online, but on the other hand, you don't want to put yourself out there for everyone to see. I've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, that's kind of the point of having social media, right? It's a delicate balance.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she mentioned that her high school actually banned Myspace, which seemed weird to me. I'm not sure how they had the right to do that, and it's not really a privacy issue, but it's still kind of strange.\n\nThat's my take on it, I guess.",
            "I don't know how to start this but I guess I should mention the Iraq War one more time. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up, but I was against it from the start, and I'm not sure why it's not that important anymore. Everyone's just kind of accepted that it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who won't admit they were wrong. It's clear when you look at the polls - in the US, Iraq, and globally, around 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops think it was a dumb idea and we should leave within a year. I just think it's been a disaster from the start, and now it's hard to see how we can get out without causing another mess. \n\nIt's all about the huge cultural gap between the US and the Middle East. I don't think we can impose democracy on a place where it's not wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but we have to weigh the pros and cons before invading. It was clear that we'd just create a disaster, like quicksand. I don't really see a reason for us to stay anymore - I haven't heard any legitimate reasons from the administration that make sense to me. If they want to leave gradually, I'm okay with that, but I just don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, it's worth listening to their opinions. At least if we ask and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. It would be better if we were seen as trying to help, rather than just being there for our own reasons.",
            "You know, I really think there's still a lot of gender bias in the United States. I mean, it's not just a women's issue, but it's more prevalent in certain industries, like the ones we work in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where people have a hard time accepting that women can be in charge or have authority. It's just how society has been conditioned for so long. In the workplace, women often have the qualifications and skills, but they're not always promoted to the top positions because people are used to seeing men in those roles.\n\nIt's not just women, though, because men can face prejudice too, especially when it comes to things like stay-at-home parenting. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and raise their kids, like it's not what men are supposed to do. They should be the breadwinners, right? But sometimes that's not what works best for the family, and it can be really tough on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's a bit different, but there's still a problem. People might not take guys who are into fashion seriously, especially if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's like, if you're a guy who likes fashion, people might think you're not really understanding what women go through. They might not take your opinions seriously because you're not part of the \"typical\" male style.\n\nAnyway, I feel like gender bias is a big issue, and it's hard to change because people have a set way of thinking. We've come a long way, but it's still slow going. I think if we keep working at the pace we are now, with women getting more into leadership positions and being accepted in business, it'll happen eventually. People will start to realize that men can be stay-at-home dads too, and that guys can be into fashion and still be taken seriously.\n\nI guess the key is to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped, but not be pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now where people are starting to get it. We've made progress, and change takes time, so I'm not sure what more we can do at this point.\n\nOh, and it's not just men and women – people can be biased against each other depending on their background, education, and even where they're from. Like, if someone's not from a city, they might get looked down on because of their grammar or accent. It's a complex issue, but I think it's worth talking about.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. That means it got bumped down from a serious offense to more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested. I think this can be a good thing, as it reduces the harsh consequences people face from a marijuana charge, especially for jobs and other important stuff. However, it's worth noting that even if it's decriminalized, there are still potential long-term effects to worry about. On the other hand, some argue that it's costly to arrest and process people for marijuana possession, and that the money saved could be better spent on other important things. \n\nIn places with a more open-minded attitude, like Denver, it seems like decriminalization has worked out well, allowing them to free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. Of course, there are still valid concerns about marijuana being available everywhere, and some people worry about the impact on society and individual behavior. I'm not sure how I feel about full legalization, but I do think it's an issue with complex pros and cons. For example, if it were fully legalized, it might lead to more people smoking and driving, which would be a problem. Plus, some people are still uncomfortable with the idea of marijuana being out in the open. In my opinion, alcohol has more significant effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more profound impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, it's hard to make generalizations about substances because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. So, it's a tough issue to tackle.",
            "To be honest, I agree \nBecause \nQuite frankly, many things they do are steeped in tradition \nThings that have been done in a very specific way for a long time \nAnd \nIt's great to have roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe in regular church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel that the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the rules precisely \nAnd \nThey often don't accept people who aren't perfectly devout Catholics, nor those from other faiths \nFor instance \nMy parents were a Catholic and an Episcopalian, and they weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith \n\nWhich \nIsn't really \nAbout being tolerant of other beliefs \nWe've always been taught to \nLove others, a fundamental Catholic principle \nHowever, it seems hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while excluding others \nThat's a major issue with some Catholic doctrine and practice \nIt's outdated, but they continue to follow it anyway \n\nHonestly, I don't think that would necessarily make a difference \nPersonally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to marry \nBut \nI don't think that would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior \nIt's a different issue altogether \nSo, I'm not sure if that would be an issue \n\nTo be honest, people who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status \nChildren are different from spouses, so \nIf someone is inclined to harm children, they probably would do it regardless of whether they're married \nAllowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents, as they would likely happen anyway \n\nNo, I don't think so",
            "Alright, I don't know what I think about this one... I'm still trying to make up my mind. It's a really tricky topic, and I'm not sure if either side is entirely right or wrong. The thing is, separating church and state can be tough, and defining marriage is even harder. It's a whole can of worms, and it's hard to resolve it without offending anyone.\n\nThe thing is, what is marriage? Is it a sacrament, or is it just a civil union? If it's a sacrament, then the government shouldn't really care about it. I mean, people who are baptized get tax breaks and other benefits, so why not married people too? And if you're married, it's just a civil union, right? Two people coming together, living together, and sharing their lives.\n\nBut then there's gay marriage. It's just two people, right? They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else. If all the states can agree on this, then it should be a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Come on, that's just not necessary. It's not a big enough deal to warrant amending the constitution.\n\nIt's just a matter of defining what marriage is and letting people live their lives. It's not worth messing with the constitution over. So, to answer your question, I don't have a clear stance on this one yet. I need some more time to think about it.",
            "Alright, I'll be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and when it comes to homosexuality, it's a bit of a complicated issue for me. On one hand, I have many gay friends and I care about them deeply, but on the other hand, I'm not entirely in agreement with the lifestyle. However, I strongly believe that it should be legalized and not made a national issue. Instead, I think it should be up to each individual state to decide for themselves. \n\nI mean, we have democratic and republican states, and it's only natural that democratic states would be more open to gay marriage. If you live in a state that leans one way or the other, I think you should respect the decision of that state. After all, you chose to live there, so it's only fair that you accept the values and laws that come with it. I believe that everyone, regardless of orientation, deserves equal opportunities, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage. \n\nAs for the current president's stance on the issue, I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't have the power to dictate how each one runs itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, and this is one of them. Plus, his term is limited, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's the states that'll have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I think this is a matter that should be left to the states, not the federal government.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor what students post online. I mean, Myspace is a public platform, after all. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that others, including school officials, might see it. Even if you're not posting under the school's name, there's nothing stopping them from accessing it from their own homes. With school safety being a top priority, I think it's reasonable for officials to keep an eye out for content that might indicate students are engaging in risky behavior, like underage drinking or smoking. \n\nNow, I'm not saying it's cool for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students and get them in trouble. But if they're using online monitoring as a tool to prevent harm and keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's kind of like when parents drop off their kids at school and expect it to be a safe environment - they want to know that the school is taking steps to prevent problems like bullying or violence. I've discussed this with a teacher before, and they told me that schools have to take proactive measures to ensure student safety, like lockdown drills and emergency preparedness. It's all about making the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nI know some people might see this as an invasion of privacy, but I don't think it's unreasonable for schools to be vigilant about student safety. After all, everything you post online can come back to haunt you, and I'd rather err on the side of caution. I mean, think about it - if you do something questionable as a college student, it can come back to bite you years later when you're a successful person. \n\nSo yeah, I think it's a public thing, and if school officials are using online monitoring to keep students safe, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Of course, it's not about going on the internet just to catch students - it's about using any available tools to prevent harm and make the school a better place. That's basically my take on it.",
            "Honestly, I've had a change of heart about the war. At first, I supported it because I was deeply affected by the events of 9/11 and wanted to see the perpetrators brought to justice. I was so caught up in my emotions that I didn't think through the long-term consequences. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, and I think that was a huge mistake. It's clear that our actions backfired, and I'm now strongly against the war.\n\nIn my opinion, the people we're fighting don't care about us as long as they're fighting among themselves. It's pointless for us to be over there, trying to impose our will on them when they can't even get along with each other. Our presence in their country has only caused more problems, and I've come to realize that I just don't care what happens over there.\n\nI sometimes wonder if they're even capable of being human, given their brutal approach to war. It seems like they're more interested in driving us out than in improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them sort out their own issues.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war in a state of emotional frenzy, driven by a desire for revenge. We weren't thinking clearly about the potential consequences or how the Iraqis would react to our presence. We were more focused on seeking payback than on creating a better future for them.\n\nIn retrospect, I think President Bush should have had a clearer plan and a more rational approach. We couldn't just ignore the threat posed by Iraq and expect everything to go back to normal. However, I believe we could have achieved more if we had a better strategy and a stronger understanding of what we were trying to accomplish.\n\nThe lack of unity and clear goals on our part only made things worse, and I think that's a crucial lesson we should learn from this experience. We can't change the Iraqi people; they're going to be who they are, and it's time for us to accept that.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're making enough progress, and I believe it's time for us to leave. Once we do, the country will likely collapse, and we'll be no better off than we are now. We can't stay in Iraq forever, and I think we're causing more harm to ourselves than good by staying."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few areas. Their views on certain issues are not really in tune with the times, and that's one reason why they're losing followers. For instance, they have strong opinions on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, but these views seem a bit outdated. If the Church adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church's stance on these issues, and that's causing them to lose faith. If you're pro-choice on abortion or support gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable following a Church that views these things as wrong. It's the same with other issues where the Church's views clash with your own. \n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. It's not like having a family life would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church. I mean, just because priests are married to God doesn't mean they can't have a life outside of their vocation. Everyone else has a job and a family life, so why can't priests?\n\nIt seems unfair that priests are expected to devote their entire lives to their work, with no personal life. I think it would be more realistic and healthy for them to have both a career and a family. It's not like they're asking for the world; they just want a bit of balance in their lives.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them responsible for who they are. It doesn't make sense to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It's not a matter of choice; they're just born with their orientation. I'm not sure I've thought it through, but it does seem wrong to me that some people are denied the right to marry because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIt seems that being gay isn't something people choose; it's just how they are. I was born straight, and people are born with different orientations, so it's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue; it's not a legal or moral issue, but rather a personal one. I don't think it's fair to judge or punish people for who they are.\n\nIt's hard for me to put into words, but I think the federal government should stay out of it. This isn't a matter of national security or morality; it's just a personal aspect of people's lives. They shouldn't have the right to interfere or judge people based on their sexual orientation. It's who people are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.\n\nThat's my two cents on the issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legalized because, honestly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but that's just not the case. It's apples and oranges; they're two different things with different aspects.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin - heads and tails are never going to be the same, but they're still part of the same coin. Same-sex couples have the same basic rights as straight couples, like property taxes and healthcare. If you're in a same-sex relationship, your partner can't be with you in the hospital if you're sick, and they can't visit because they're not technically considered family. It's a pretty silly reason to deny someone's partner the right to be with them in a time of need.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as straight couples. At the end of the day, it's just a relationship - the same thing. Where people get hung up is on the fact that same-sex couples aren't asking for a church wedding, they're asking for a marriage certificate from the government. If you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as straight couples, and people worry about adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. The real issue is that some people are uncomfortable with the idea of same-sex relationships, and that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights.\n\nPeople worry about the impact on children, but that's a complex issue. Some people think that children of same-sex couples will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation, but that's just not true. Children are influenced by their parents' values and parenting skills, not their orientation. And just like straight couples, gay couples can be good parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state, and the amendment against it should be repealed. President Bush has his own views on gay marriage, which are based on his religious beliefs, but that's not a good enough reason to deny someone's rights. The government should be more inclusive and not impose its own moral views on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged, but that's just not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not supported by research, and people should listen to experts, not just their opinions or cultural norms. If we listened to institutions that have actually studied these issues, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have some beneficial properties. I mean, as far as making it available to the public, I'm absolutely against it. I don't think that's a good idea. But, for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. If we dismiss something just because it's not allowed, that's not fair. There are plenty of controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, that we use all the time in the pharmacy because they're beneficial, even though they're not exactly legal. We shouldn't be denying the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it. I think we should be embracing its potential benefits.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol. I mean, if you overuse marijuana, it can have negative consequences, just like with alcohol. It's a tough issue. I think the key is to integrate it gradually, rather than making it legal all at once. If we did that, it might get abused, but if we can first remove the negative image associated with marijuana, people might be more likely to use it responsibly.\n\nYou see, people have this really bad perception of marijuana because it's an illicit substance. But, it's not as bad as, say, heroin or cocaine. I think if we can change the way people view marijuana, they might be more likely to use it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, and I've noticed this firsthand, especially when I attend church services. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday and dress up in matching outfits, including cute dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal, and I felt like it was a special occasion. However, as I've grown older, the church has started to adapt to the changing times. They've even introduced a 30-minute mass for teenagers, which has become more casual. People now wear jeans and khakis, even during morning masses, which was previously a time for more formal attire.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift in the overall atmosphere. The church I'm familiar with has become more relaxed, and it's not as formal as it used to be. I'm not aware of the church's politics, but I think this is a good thing.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are men who become pedophiles regardless of their marital status, and their attraction to young children is not something that can be altered by marriage or other external factors. I think it's a personal choice to become a priest, and if someone wants to be married while practicing their faith, they might consider a different denomination that allows it, like the Seventh-day Adventist Church. I don't think the church's stance on marriage or celibacy is the root cause of the problem.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is largely determined by genetics. People are born with certain inclinations, and it's not something that can be changed through upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some instances may be influenced by environmental factors, I believe that genetics play a significant role. Trying to hide or suppress these tendencies through marriage or other means is unlikely to be effective in the long run. If the church was aware of these situations and chose to cover them up, that's unacceptable, but I don't think they could have prevented the problem in the first place.\n\nI don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point, but I appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective on this sensitive issue.",
            "Honestly, I initially agreed with the premise, but I have to admit that the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was a really volatile time, and I think we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext to address some other issues that were already on the table. The Bush administration was quick to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false. That really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war has always been a sensitive topic for me.\n\nTo me, it seems like the Bush administration has been flagrantly lying to the American people, and they've yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented that infamous UN speech, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. It's like they're trying to get away with malfeasance in office, which I think is a serious offense that should be impeachable. They seem to have this disregard for the constitution and have been trying to undermine it since 9/11, at least.\n\nI think they came into office with a predetermined plan to go to war, and the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his dad's administration. He might have been hoping to expand the US energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nWhile I think it's time to get out of Iraq, I'm aware that withdrawing now could lead to chaos and more deaths as the country teeters on the brink of civil war. The current alternative, a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, might not be the best idea either, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create more problems in the long run.\n\nThe Iraqi government seems ineffective, and from what I've seen, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, especially with parties like Mugtada al-Sadr's holding sway. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the best solution is.",
            "You know, I've been thinking about the War in Iraq, and I'm not sure where I stand on it. To be honest, it's all kind of confusing, but I guess my main feeling is that it's pointless, or at least it doesn't feel like it's going anywhere. I mean, it's not even officially declared as a war, so it's hard to really understand what's going on.\n\nI think it was kind of like a response to the 9/11 attacks, since Iraq was suspected of being involved. But now, it feels like we're just stuck there trying to build democracy, which is a long-term goal, and it's hard to see how it's actually making things better. Plus, we're also interested in getting oil from them, which doesn't seem like a good reason to be there.\n\nThe thing is, if we leave, Iraq will be upset, but if we stay, it's going to take forever to build a stable democracy, and it's going to be hard to leave without messing things up even more. And if we keep trying to impose our values on them, it's going to create more problems, like more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida.\n\nIt's all really complicated, and I don't know what the best solution is. I guess I'm just worried that it's going to drag on for years and years, and it's not going to end well. That's pretty much my take on it.\n\nAs for calling it a war, I don't think that's even accurate. I mean, it wasn't declared by Congress, so it doesn't feel like a real war to me. And it's hard to justify staying there when it's causing so much suffering and destruction.\n\nBut at the same time, I know there are families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I feel for them. It's hard to know what to do, because I don't want to see anyone get hurt, but I also don't want us to be stuck in a situation that's not making things better.\n\nI guess that's my take on it. It's all just really complicated, and I don't know what the answer is.",
            "Honestly, I think it's unfair for a government to make laws based on religious beliefs. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle in the constitution, and it's clearly stated that the government should not interfere with church matters. I believe that trying to enforce laws based on one church's views would be a direct contradiction to this principle.\n\nIt seems to me that those pushing for a ban on a certain issue are essentially favoring one church over others. For example, most Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, but there are some exceptions. However, I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't allow.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for religious tolerance and freedom. Given that an amendment is being proposed, I think it's misguided and contradictory to the existing laws. It would be one of the few amendments intended to restrict individuals rather than the government.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs, and it's unfair to impose his views on others. Every religion should have the freedom to make its own decisions, and it's up to the churches to decide what's right for them, not the government.\n\nI don't see any solid reason for the amendment, other than personal opinions. It's not clear how it would impact the economy or society in a positive way. In fact, it might even have a beneficial effect by promoting a more open and accepting society. I think I've said all I need to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq has left me with many unanswered questions. I think the US government may not have been entirely honest with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. They attempted to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks, which didn't necessarily have a direct connection. This emotional manipulation of the public's sentiment may have contributed to the invasion in 2003. As someone who's generally against going to war, especially preemptive strikes, I think the parallels between the Iraq war and the Vietnam War are striking. The US government seemed to disregard the lessons learned from past mistakes, resulting in a tremendous loss of American lives.\n\nThe invasion and removal of the Iraqi government were poorly planned, and the US didn't anticipate the chaos and power vacuum that would follow. They're now trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their attempts in Vietnam to oust Communists and install democracy. However, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process, not a quick, clear victory.\n\nIt's almost impossible to win against an entire nation's population when fighting insurgents, as opposed to a conventional army. I think the government underestimated the difficulty of this task and didn't prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. It's been almost a decade since the invasion, and we're still there, struggling to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to secure their own country. I believe the government has been naive in thinking this would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long and arduous process, with many struggles and civil wars along the way. The US government made it seem like establishing democracy in Iraq would be relatively easy, which was a misleading message. It's a difficult decision to make, especially considering the long-term commitment required to establish a stable government.\n\nThe idea of abandoning Iraq now, after removing their government and disrupting their way of life, is a moral dilemma. We should try to see this through, but on the other hand, the number of American casualties is staggering, and it's hard to justify the risks involved. It seems to me that the real reason for invading Iraq was to control its oil resources, rather than to spread democracy. The lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a key factor in the decision to invade, yet countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, weren't targeted.\n\nI just hope the war in Iraq ends soon and that there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, it's unlikely to happen anytime soon.",
            "Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and state my opinion on gay marriage - I'm in favor of it. To be honest, I always have been. I think it comes down to personal preference, and it's been proven that it's not just a matter of environment, but also biology. So, it's unfair to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI believe it's inhumane to do so, and I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. In my opinion, the government and politics shouldn't have a say in this matter - it's a personal decision that affects individuals and their families, not the state.\n\nTake my neighborhood back home, for example. There are a few openly gay couples living there who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family would. They walk their dogs, interact with their neighbors, and go about their daily lives just like everyone else. It's not right that President Bush thinks he can interpret what marriage means and dictate it to everyone else.\n\nI think it's ridiculous when you consider that research has shown that there may be a biological component to being gay, rather than it being a product of environment or upbringing. It's not just about the number of siblings you have or the presence of a father figure - there are actual chemical factors at play.\n\nIf a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately without anyone's knowledge, but if a same-sex couple wants to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public scrutiny and national attention.",
            "I mean, seriously, when you post something online, it's a public platform. It's out there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. You put something out there, and it's going to influence how people perceive you. Talking about violent or disturbing topics can spark people's reactions, and if you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, they'll see that bulletin. It's not the school that receives the bulletin; someone else shares it, and they have to take action. They can't just ignore it, or who knows, something bad might happen, and they could have prevented it.\n\nIt's tough to know what's serious and what's just a joke. Take the incident we had on campus, for instance. It might have been a sociology experiment gone wrong or a genuine threat. Either way, when people heard about it, they were worried. When you share stuff online, there's no invasion of privacy; if you don't want it out there, don't post it. You can't control what people think or take seriously. It's not like you can dictate how others perceive you.\n\nI don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media platforms or snoop through their profiles. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously. It's not the same as monitoring phone conversations, texts, or IMs. If a teacher creates a fake account to befriend students, that's crossing a line. I wouldn't do that as an R.A. because I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially if they're posting pictures of themselves having fun. That's not my concern, and I shouldn't have to deal with it.",
            "I feel that the war has been dragging on for too long. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in another country, which was a noble goal. However, it seems that we've lost sight of this purpose and are now just going through the motions to prove our strength as a superpower. I also wonder if the original motivation was tainted by George Bush's personal vendetta with Saddam Hussein, given his father's previous conflicts with him. If the war was meant to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason, but I'm not convinced that personal agendas were involved.\n\nI think we made our point clear in the first few months of the war, and that was a significant statement in itself. But continuing to fight for over a year or multiple years is just too prolonged. If our goal was to free a country from tyranny, that's a noble purpose, but I think our reasoning has been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting.\n\nI believe it's time for us to bring this war to an end. Our government officials should be able to fend for themselves by now. We're wasting billions of dollars on a war that's been dragging on for too long, while we have our own domestic issues to address, like poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare. It's time to redirect that money towards our own problems, rather than continuing to hemorrhage it in a foreign conflict that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe money being spent on war could be better used to fund essential public services, like education, healthcare, and public transportation. The fact that our citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost its way is unacceptable. I think that's the main issue here.",
            "I was wondering if you could clarify something for me. I was thinking about this situation where someone actually prevented a potentially bad situation from happening because they found out about it online. Apparently, it was because someone had discovered the information on a social media website like Myspace.\n\nOkay, so, I was thinking, if you post something online, it's pretty much public information, right? On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile, but if you're friends with them, you're basically giving them permission to see your stuff. It's kind of like that when you put anything online, you're kind of open to everyone seeing it.\n\nI have to admit, I think it's actually good that someone was able to see that information and prevent something bad from happening. But, on the other hand, it's a tough situation because you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's online activity to prevent bad things from happening. That would be like some kind of profiling, which isn't fair. But, at the same time, if someone is looking for information and they happen to stumble upon something that indicates someone is planning something bad, it's a different story.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's kind of weird to think about how much information is out there about you online, and how easily someone can access it. I've heard stories about people being able to find out all sorts of personal information about people online, which is pretty scary. For example, I saw a TV show about someone who was able to find out a girl's screen name and start talking to her on instant messenger, and she ended up meeting with him. It's crazy to think about how easily that can happen.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because, on the one hand, you want to be able to connect with your friends online, but on the other hand, you don't want to put yourself out there for everyone to see. I've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, that's kind of the point of having social media, right? It's a delicate balance.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she mentioned that her high school actually banned Myspace, which seemed weird to me. I'm not sure how they had the right to do that, and it's not really a privacy issue, but it's still kind of strange.\n\nThat's my take on it, I guess.",
            "I don't know how to start this but I guess I should mention the Iraq War one more time. Honestly, I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up, but I was against it from the start, and I'm not sure why it's not that important anymore. Everyone's just kind of accepted that it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who won't admit they were wrong. It's clear when you look at the polls - in the US, Iraq, and globally, around 75-80% of people think it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqi people and 70% of US troops think it was a dumb idea and we should leave within a year. I just think it's been a disaster from the start, and now it's hard to see how we can get out without causing another mess. \n\nIt's all about the huge cultural gap between the US and the Middle East. I don't think we can impose democracy on a place where it's not wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but we have to weigh the pros and cons before invading. It was clear that we'd just create a disaster, like quicksand. I don't really see a reason for us to stay anymore - I haven't heard any legitimate reasons from the administration that make sense to me. If they want to leave gradually, I'm okay with that, but I just don't see why we can't leave now. It's interesting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter think we should leave immediately. If we're trying to help them, it's worth listening to their opinions. At least if we ask and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. It would be better if we were seen as trying to help, rather than just being there for our own reasons.",
            "You know, I really think there's still a lot of gender bias in the United States. I mean, it's not just a women's issue, but it's more prevalent in certain industries, like the ones we work in. For me, I feel like women have it tougher because there's this whole \"glass ceiling\" thing, where people have a hard time accepting that women can be in charge or have authority. It's just how society has been conditioned for so long. In the workplace, women often have the qualifications and skills, but they're not always promoted to the top positions because people are used to seeing men in those roles.\n\nIt's not just women, though, because men can face prejudice too, especially when it comes to things like stay-at-home parenting. People often look down on men who choose to stay home and raise their kids, like it's not what men are supposed to do. They should be the breadwinners, right? But sometimes that's not what works best for the family, and it can be really tough on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's a bit different, but there's still a problem. People might not take guys who are into fashion seriously, especially if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's like, if you're a guy who likes fashion, people might think you're not really understanding what women go through. They might not take your opinions seriously because you're not part of the \"typical\" male style.\n\nAnyway, I feel like gender bias is a big issue, and it's hard to change because people have a set way of thinking. We've come a long way, but it's still slow going. I think if we keep working at the pace we are now, with women getting more into leadership positions and being accepted in business, it'll happen eventually. People will start to realize that men can be stay-at-home dads too, and that guys can be into fashion and still be taken seriously.\n\nI guess the key is to promote the qualities of people who are often stereotyped, but not be pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now where people are starting to get it. We've made progress, and change takes time, so I'm not sure what more we can do at this point.\n\nOh, and it's not just men and women – people can be biased against each other depending on their background, education, and even where they're from. Like, if someone's not from a city, they might get looked down on because of their grammar or accent. It's a complex issue, but I think it's worth talking about.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it fully legal, but rather decriminalized it. That means it got bumped down from a serious offense to more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested. I think this can be a good thing, as it reduces the harsh consequences people face from a marijuana charge, especially for jobs and other important stuff. However, it's worth noting that even if it's decriminalized, there are still potential long-term effects to worry about. On the other hand, some argue that it's costly to arrest and process people for marijuana possession, and that the money saved could be better spent on other important things. \n\nIn places with a more open-minded attitude, like Denver, it seems like decriminalization has worked out well, allowing them to free up funds for more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. Of course, there are still valid concerns about marijuana being available everywhere, and some people worry about the impact on society and individual behavior. I'm not sure how I feel about full legalization, but I do think it's an issue with complex pros and cons. For example, if it were fully legalized, it might lead to more people smoking and driving, which would be a problem. Plus, some people are still uncomfortable with the idea of marijuana being out in the open. In my opinion, alcohol has more significant effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more profound impact on people's lifestyles. Ultimately, it's hard to make generalizations about substances because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. So, it's a tough issue to tackle.",
            "To be honest, I agree \nBecause \nQuite frankly, many things they do are steeped in tradition \nThings that have been done in a very specific way for a long time \nAnd \nIt's great to have roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be adaptable to change \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe in regular church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel that the Catholic Church looks down on those who don't follow the rules precisely \nAnd \nThey often don't accept people who aren't perfectly devout Catholics, nor those from other faiths \nFor instance \nMy parents were a Catholic and an Episcopalian, and they weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's faith \n\nWhich \nIsn't really \nAbout being tolerant of other beliefs \nWe've always been taught to \nLove others, a fundamental Catholic principle \nHowever, it seems hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while excluding others \nThat's a major issue with some Catholic doctrine and practice \nIt's outdated, but they continue to follow it anyway \n\nHonestly, I don't think that would necessarily make a difference \nPersonally, I think it would be a good idea for priests to be allowed to marry \nBut \nI don't think that would necessarily stop pedophilic behavior \nIt's a different issue altogether \nSo, I'm not sure if that would be an issue \n\nTo be honest, people who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status \nChildren are different from spouses, so \nIf someone is inclined to harm children, they probably would do it regardless of whether they're married \nAllowing priests to be married might not prevent these incidents, as they would likely happen anyway \n\nNo, I don't think so",
            "Alright, I don't know what I think about this one... I'm still trying to make up my mind. It's a really tricky topic, and I'm not sure if either side is entirely right or wrong. The thing is, separating church and state can be tough, and defining marriage is even harder. It's a whole can of worms, and it's hard to resolve it without offending anyone.\n\nThe thing is, what is marriage? Is it a sacrament, or is it just a civil union? If it's a sacrament, then the government shouldn't really care about it. I mean, people who are baptized get tax breaks and other benefits, so why not married people too? And if you're married, it's just a civil union, right? Two people coming together, living together, and sharing their lives.\n\nBut then there's gay marriage. It's just two people, right? They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else. If all the states can agree on this, then it should be a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? Come on, that's just not necessary. It's not a big enough deal to warrant amending the constitution.\n\nIt's just a matter of defining what marriage is and letting people live their lives. It's not worth messing with the constitution over. So, to answer your question, I don't have a clear stance on this one yet. I need some more time to think about it.",
            "Alright, I'll be honest, I was raised in a Christian household, and when it comes to homosexuality, it's a bit of a complicated issue for me. On one hand, I have many gay friends and I care about them deeply, but on the other hand, I'm not entirely in agreement with the lifestyle. However, I strongly believe that it should be legalized and not made a national issue. Instead, I think it should be up to each individual state to decide for themselves. \n\nI mean, we have democratic and republican states, and it's only natural that democratic states would be more open to gay marriage. If you live in a state that leans one way or the other, I think you should respect the decision of that state. After all, you chose to live there, so it's only fair that you accept the values and laws that come with it. I believe that everyone, regardless of orientation, deserves equal opportunities, so I think it should be up to each state to decide whether or not to legalize gay marriage. \n\nAs for the current president's stance on the issue, I don't think it's right for him to impose his views on the entire country. He doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't have the power to dictate how each one runs itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, and this is one of them. Plus, his term is limited, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's the states that'll have to live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I think this is a matter that should be left to the states, not the federal government.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor what students post online. I mean, Myspace is a public platform, after all. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that others, including school officials, might see it. Even if you're not posting under the school's name, there's nothing stopping them from accessing it from their own homes. With school safety being a top priority, I think it's reasonable for officials to keep an eye out for content that might indicate students are engaging in risky behavior, like underage drinking or smoking. \n\nNow, I'm not saying it's cool for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students and get them in trouble. But if they're using online monitoring as a tool to prevent harm and keep students safe, I don't see it as an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's kind of like when parents drop off their kids at school and expect it to be a safe environment - they want to know that the school is taking steps to prevent problems like bullying or violence. I've discussed this with a teacher before, and they told me that schools have to take proactive measures to ensure student safety, like lockdown drills and emergency preparedness. It's all about making the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nI know some people might see this as an invasion of privacy, but I don't think it's unreasonable for schools to be vigilant about student safety. After all, everything you post online can come back to haunt you, and I'd rather err on the side of caution. I mean, think about it - if you do something questionable as a college student, it can come back to bite you years later when you're a successful person. \n\nSo yeah, I think it's a public thing, and if school officials are using online monitoring to keep students safe, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Of course, it's not about going on the internet just to catch students - it's about using any available tools to prevent harm and make the school a better place. That's basically my take on it.",
            "Honestly, I've had a change of heart about the war. At first, I supported it because I was deeply affected by the events of 9/11 and wanted to see the perpetrators brought to justice. I was so caught up in my emotions that I didn't think through the long-term consequences. We rushed into the war without a clear plan, and I think that was a huge mistake. It's clear that our actions backfired, and I'm now strongly against the war.\n\nIn my opinion, the people we're fighting don't care about us as long as they're fighting among themselves. It's pointless for us to be over there, trying to impose our will on them when they can't even get along with each other. Our presence in their country has only caused more problems, and I've come to realize that I just don't care what happens over there.\n\nI sometimes wonder if they're even capable of being human, given their brutal approach to war. It seems like they're more interested in driving us out than in improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them sort out their own issues.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war in a state of emotional frenzy, driven by a desire for revenge. We weren't thinking clearly about the potential consequences or how the Iraqis would react to our presence. We were more focused on seeking payback than on creating a better future for them.\n\nIn retrospect, I think President Bush should have had a clearer plan and a more rational approach. We couldn't just ignore the threat posed by Iraq and expect everything to go back to normal. However, I believe we could have achieved more if we had a better strategy and a stronger understanding of what we were trying to accomplish.\n\nThe lack of unity and clear goals on our part only made things worse, and I think that's a crucial lesson we should learn from this experience. We can't change the Iraqi people; they're going to be who they are, and it's time for us to accept that.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're making enough progress, and I believe it's time for us to leave. Once we do, the country will likely collapse, and we'll be no better off than we are now. We can't stay in Iraq forever, and I think we're causing more harm to ourselves than good by staying."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to evolve and adapt to the changing times. One reason for the decline in its following might be its rather restrictive and outdated views on various subjects. Take, for instance, the Church's stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control – these are issues where the Church's views seem to be stuck in the past. If they could update their perspective and become more accepting of modern ideas, they might not be losing followers.\n\nI've noticed that many people are increasingly alienated from the Church due to its rigid stance on these matters. Those who don't agree with the Church's views on, say, abortion, might find it challenging to be part of a community that actively discourages it. Similarly, individuals who support gay marriage or have similar views might feel unwelcome in a Church that doesn't condone it.\n\nI also think it's time for the Church to reconsider its stance on female priests and married priests. I don't see why priests can't be married or why women can't serve as priests. After all, the Church sees priests as being devoted to a higher authority, but I believe that's no reason to deny them a personal life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family, so why should priests be any different? It's time for the Church to modernize and become more inclusive.",
            "Honestly, I never thought I'd take a strong stance on gay marriage, but I have to admit that I'm not opposed to it. To me, people are either born gay or it's just part of who they are, and it's not something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them accountable for their sexual orientation. In my opinion, it's wrong to say that a man and woman can get married, but a same-sex couple can't. I mean, why should people be judged for who they are? It's not a topic I've given a lot of thought to, but it's clear to me that it's not right to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's worth considering that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can control. Like, I was born straight, and I'm pretty sure people are born gay too. It's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the government should be involved in something like this, as it's not really a legal or moral issue – it's just a matter of people being who they are. I don't think they should be judged or stigmatized for it. The government should just leave people alone and let them live their lives.\n\nIt's hard to understand why the government feels it's necessary to interfere in people's personal lives like this. It's not like it affects national security or anything. They just seem to be overstepping their bounds and imposing their opinions on people who don't really need it. To me, it's about accepting people for who they are and not trying to change them or punish them for being different. That's just not right.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm of the opinion that gay marriage should be legalized. There's not really a solid reason why it shouldn't be. Some people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's a misconception. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're two different things.\n\nThere are many aspects to consider, and it's hard to draw parallels between the two. It's like two sides of the same coin – you can't have one without the other. Civil rights come into play, such as property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit your partner in the hospital. It seems unfair that these rights aren't extended to same-sex couples.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples. It's all about the relationship itself, not the orientation of the individuals involved. The problem lies in the fact that people are getting hung up on the idea of church and state. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nIf we separate church and state, then it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation – separate but unequal. In a legal sense, if you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage? The main points of contention seem to be adoption issues, community concerns, and the potential impact on children raised by gay parents.\n\nSome people worry about how children will adjust to societal norms and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. However, it's hard to say for certain, especially when it comes to adoption. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In places like New York City, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and exclusion in public schools.\n\nUltimately, parenting skills are the same regardless of orientation. It comes down to individual personality choices, not the couple's makeup. I think the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal across the board. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage seem to be rooted in his personal moral code, which is influenced by his religion. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its moral views on the rest of the country, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and the separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has debunked this notion. Instead of listening to popular opinion or personal biases, we should rely on research and studies to inform our views on this issue.",
            "You know, I work at the hospital pharmacy and I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. I mean, it's pretty clear that if it's available for the public, I don't think it's a good idea. No way, not at all. But if we're talking about using it for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, even if something is illegal, it doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's a pretty simple idea, but some people just don't get it.\n\nFor example, there are loads of controlled substances that we use in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're basically off-limits to the public, but we use them all the time because they're actually pretty useful. And if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it, that doesn't make any sense to me. I think we should just accept its potential benefits and not be so judgmental.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think marijuana is that similar to alcohol, even though abusing either one can have negative consequences. But if we're talking about making it legal, I'd say it's better to do it gradually, not all at once. If we just remove the taboo around marijuana and people start to use it responsibly, that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really negative image of marijuana because it's seen as an illicit substance. But the truth is, it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. And if we can change that perception, maybe people will start to use it more sensibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern era. They're no longer as strict as they used to be. I can compare this to my own experiences growing up - I used to attend church every Sunday and get dressed up in matching outfits, but now they've introduced a more casual teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress down, even at the morning masses, and it's not uncommon to see families rushing in late or wearing beachwear. I think this shift towards casualness is a big change.\n\nTo be honest, that's the most noticeable thing to me about the church I'm familiar with. I'm not sure about the church's internal politics, but that's pretty much it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind lately is the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think these issues would have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Some men who are married still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not necessarily about their marital status. It's about the individual's character. I also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone wants to practice their faith while being married, they might consider a different religion. For example, some denominations allow their clergy to be married.\n\nIn my opinion, it's the individual's genetics that determine their sexuality, not their upbringing. I don't think people just develop these tendencies; they're born with them. You can't hide that through a marriage, and it's likely to come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done much to prevent these issues from happening. If they did know about it and tried to cover it up, that's a different story altogether, but I don't think that was always the case.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have anything to add.",
            "I mean, I was initially okay with the idea of the war, but I strongly felt that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and that we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext, with a bunch of pretexts leading us there. \n\nI think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which we later found out was all a lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. \n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who made that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. It's clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. \n\nIt's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he was also hoping to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nI think the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now would probably lead to chaos and more deaths, as the country could slide into civil war. The alternative being considered now is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either, as it would raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and could lead to more problems in the long run. \n\nThe interim government is failing, and the Parliament isn't effective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the political process. Even the anti-American cleric, Muktada al-Sadr, has a significant presence in the Parliament now, and there are still radical elements vying for control of the government, causing a lot of friction in the political process. \n\nHonestly, I don't have a solution that I can articulate without offending anyone.",
            "I'm thinking about the War in Iraq, and it's not easy to form a clear opinion. I mean, it's not even considered a declared war. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, kind of like in the US, and also to gain access to their oil resources. But the problem is, it's causing a lot of tension and upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to try to build democracy, which is a long-term process that can't be rushed. And if we leave, the Iraqis might be angry that we messed things up and they'll have to start from scratch. This whole situation is really complicated.\n\nI think the war is hard to wrap my head around, and I'm not sure what to say. I don't really know much about it. Do you have any other topics we can discuss?\n\nBut, if I'm being honest, I think the war should continue, but only because people are being forced to fight. I don't think we should call it a war anymore, though. I think it's more about showing off our military strength and power. It never should have been called a war in the first place, since it was never officially declared by Congress. You have to declare a war through Congress to make it official.\n\nI think we should be helping Iraq, but it's also a waste of our resources. And especially now, with Bush being president, it's making him look really bad. He's getting a bad reputation because of the war's impact and the way it's affecting people. Remember the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless conflict. I don't want Bush to be known as the president who started another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to be safe, but at the same time, I don't think we should be trying to mold them into a second US, which would only make things worse. The culture is so different, and I'm worried that our attempts to change them will only fuel more hatred towards the US. The Al-Qaeda situation will probably get worse, and we'll be stuck in a never-ending conflict.\n\nI think this whole situation will drag on for years to come. That's my take on it, I guess.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with making it a law or even letting the government decide it's legal. I think it's something that should be up to the churches, considering what the constitution says about separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that this is something that's already been stated and established. Trying to exert any kind of control over it would be a pretty big defiance of the constitution's principles.\n\nI think the people pushing to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what's allowed or not for the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, and it's what allows for religious tolerance in the US. I think trying to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government, which I don't think is right at all.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, and it's basically showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the government, and there's no real reason to back it up other than personal views.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see how it would have a major impact on the economy or anything else. If anything, it might even have a positive impact on society. I'm not sure how, but I think it could be a good thing.\n\nI've pretty much said it all, so I'm not sure I have much more to add.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely truthful about the reasons for going to war before invading the country. I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it wasn't as directly related as they made it out to be. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using the outrage from the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war.\n\nI personally oppose war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would occur.\n\nThey're trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted to do in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult process, and not a clear-cut victory. It's hard to fight an insurgency when you're fighting against the citizens of the country, not a traditional army.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes and been more prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. They weren't, and now we're still in Iraq, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. We're still training the Iraqi troops and police to take control of their own country, which is a long process.\n\nI believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn't be so naive about the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful. Democracy was a long struggle in our own country, and it's not an easy thing to achieve.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you consider the number of American casualties and the cost of continuing the war. I think we should try to see it through, but it's also important to consider the human cost and the question of whether it's worth it.\n\nOne of my concerns is that the war in Iraq is partly about oil and controlling resources. We invaded Iraq supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but we're not doing the same thing in other countries with similar issues. I think the US government isn't being entirely truthful about their motives and decisions.\n\nLet's hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon.",
            "I mean, I'm for gay marriage, and I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been shown to be biological rather than a result of societal influences. I think it's unfair to deprive people of rights due to something they can't control, which is their sexual orientation. It's almost inhumane, and I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this, it's a personal, household-level issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily business, and it's no different from any other family.\n\nI think it's ridiculous that Bush is trying to impose his interpretation of marriage on everyone else. It's clear that there's a biological component to being gay, and it's not something people choose. Research suggests that there's a chemical aspect to it, something people are predisposed to, rather than a result of their upbringing or environment.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's publicly scrutinized. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without drawing attention to themselves, but if a same-sex couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a major news event. It's just not right.",
            "Uh, I mean, when you post something online, it becomes public knowledge. It's completely out there, and you can't take it back. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. Once you share something online, it can shape people's perceptions of you, and that's a fact.\n\nIf you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably respond, and it can get out of hand. The internet is a public forum, and if you're connected to that person on social media, you'll likely see their messages. It's not the school that receives the message; it's someone who's seen it and decides to report it.\n\nSchool administrators have to act on it because they can't just ignore it, or they might miss an opportunity to prevent something serious from happening. It's a tough call, because you don't always know what to take seriously – it could be a joke or a serious threat.\n\nIn a recent situation, someone overheard a friend talking about something, and when we looked into it, we found some concerning posts on their social media account. It's a bit of a double-edged sword: you can't control what people think, and you can't dictate what they take seriously. If you don't want something shared, don't put it online.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media or snoop through their accounts. If something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously, but that's different from monitoring personal conversations or messages. It's a fine line to walk.\n\nI think it's a good idea for teachers to avoid creating fake social media accounts to friend their students – it's not a good idea for them to know that kind of information about their residents, and it's not their place to intervene. It's a delicate situation, and I'm not sure what the best approach is.",
            "I think the war has dragged out for far too long. Initially, the intention was good - to restore democracy in another country. However, we seem to have lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It's as if we're just doing it to prove our power, rather than to achieve a genuine purpose. I'm also concerned that the original motives were questionable, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn all honesty, I believe that if the goal was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. But I do think the war has gone on for far too long. I think we made our point in the initial stages of the conflict, with the invasion itself serving as a powerful statement. However, the fact that it's dragged on for years has made it seem like we're fighting just for the sake of fighting.\n\nIf our original intention was to free a country from tyranny, that would be a noble cause. But over time, our reasons for being there seem to have become distorted and misguided. It feels like we're still at war because we don't want to admit defeat or back down. I genuinely believe that the war has gone on long enough and it's time to bring it to an end.\n\nWe've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's not even benefiting us in the long run. We have our own problems to address, such as poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare, which could be better funded with that money. It's frustrating to think that our own citizens are being put in harm's way in a war that we're no longer fighting for a clear purpose.",
            "I have a question that I want to clarify. I was wondering if it's okay to ask, it was prevented because someone went online and found a particular issue. To be honest, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nWhen you post information on the internet, you have to accept that it's available for everyone to see. For example, on social media sites like Myspace, if you want to view someone's profile, you usually have to be their friend or join the site, which means you've given permission for them to see your profile. It's like you're giving them access to your online space.\n\nI think it's a good thing that someone was able to see this information and prevent a serious situation from happening. However, it also raises some concerns about overreach and potential discrimination. If someone is constantly monitoring students' online profiles, it could be seen as unfair.\n\nI'm not sure how this situation would work in practice. Would they be monitoring everyone's profiles, or just looking for specific information? It's a tricky issue because it's hard to balance the need for safety with the need for personal freedom. I've had my own experiences with online safety, having a Facebook account and being aware of the potential risks. I've seen cases where people have been able to gather a lot of information about someone just by looking at their online profiles.\n\nIt's a bit unsettling, to be honest. I've tried to limit the information I share online, but I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a delicate balance between being open and being safe.\n\nI heard about a case where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed a bit extreme to me. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure what the right approach is.",
            "I guess I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, but I'm going to go ahead and share my thoughts on it. I mean, I was against the war from the start, but it's not really a big deal now since everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who don't want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nLooking at recent polls, it's clear that the majority of people worldwide think the war was a bad idea. In fact, over 75 to 80% of the global population agrees with this. This includes the Iraqi people, who are the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and an astonishing 70 to 80% of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it was a dumb idea and that we should leave within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the very beginning, and now that we're trying to pull out, it's going to be a disaster as well. I think the problem lies in the cultural gap between the US and the Middle East, and the US administration's idea of imposing democracy on a region that wouldn't choose it for itself. I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, but it's not that simple. Before invading, we should have weighed the pros and cons, considering the potential consequences of turning Iraq into a disaster zone.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for staying, and concerns about what might happen if we leave, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't leave now.\n\nIt's worth noting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight. If we ask them if we should stay and they say no, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We could at least say we were trying to help, but they made the decision to leave.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, and I don't think we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least if we leave, it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "You know, I really think that gender discrimination is still a big issue in the US. I mean, it's not just about women, it's about the specific job or field you're in. For instance, women often face it more because of the \"glass ceiling\" - even when equality is supposed to exist, it can be tough for them to break through and get ahead. This is because society has been conditioned to think a certain way for so long, and it's hard to change.\n\nTake workplaces for example. Women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because it's not the norm for women to be in top positions. It's the same with men in industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. Society looks down on men who choose to be stay-at-home dads, thinking they should be the breadwinner. It's hard on them because they might have always wanted to spend time with their kids and be a part of their lives.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are straight can often be stereotyped and looked down upon. People might think, \"If you're a man in fashion, you must be doing it for women.\" It's like, how do we know what your style is like just because you're a guy? Depending on the job or field, there's definitely gender discrimination going on.\n\nIt's tough to change this mindset because society has a set way of thinking, and it's only moving slowly. But we're making progress, and women are getting more accepted in the business world and becoming CEOs. Men who are stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted. It's a slow process, but it's happening.\n\nI think the key is to promote the qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, where it's starting to become more accepted. I'm not sure what more we can do that isn't already being done, because if we move too fast, people will resist. Change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, though - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their background. If someone has a strong accent or hasn't had the best education, but is still super intelligent, they might be discriminated against by others who think they can't be taken seriously. It's not just a one-way street, and it's not just about gender.",
            "To be honest, I think the laws surrounding it are a bit confusing. My understanding is that they didn't fully legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means it's more like a traffic ticket, something you get cited for rather than being arrested and charged with a crime. \n\nI think one of the major concerns people have is the long-term consequences of getting caught with a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized. These consequences can still affect job interviews and other areas of life. However, on the other hand, not arresting people and going through the whole process can be quite costly for municipalities, which might be a reason some places don't want to make the change. \n\nIn places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I think decriminalization is a good idea. It's freed up money that can be spent on more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. \n\nIt's not a simple issue, though. While marijuana might not be as bad as some people think, there are still concerns about its widespread availability and how it might affect people's behavior. Some people might be worried about the potential for it to be smoked in public, which could be awkward for those who don't approve. \n\nIt's also worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to substances. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. \n\nOverall, I think it's a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "I agree that the Catholic Church has many traditional practices, which are good to hold onto, but also essential to adapt to change. Many Catholics attend Church every week and follow the doctrine strictly, yet sometimes it seems like the Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. It's hypocritical to teach love and acceptance while not accepting others who don't adhere to the same beliefs, especially when it comes to other religions. For instance, my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their different faiths. This lack of acceptance makes me question the Church's tolerance.\n\nIt's not just the doctrine that's a problem; the Church's practice often contradicts its teachings. The Church sticks to outdated traditions even when they no longer serve a purpose. I believe it's essential to reevaluate and update these practices to be more inclusive and accepting. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I don't think it would necessarily prevent pedophilia. Molesting children is a separate issue from marriage, and people who engage in such behavior will likely do so regardless of their marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not address the root problem, and I believe it's not a solution to the issue at hand.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this issue, to be honest.  I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong, but I do think this is a really tough topic to tackle. The line between church and state is already pretty blurry, and defining marriage is a minefield in itself. It's hard to navigate without stepping on anyone's toes. To be frank, I'm not sure what I think, but I'm starting to lean towards the idea that civil unions should be the focus. I mean, why should the government care about the specifics of a marriage, as long as it's a union between two consenting adults? It's not about the sacrament or the church; it's about two people coming together. And if we're being strict about it, civil unions would be a more accurate label, as it's the government that recognizes the union, not the church. Now, when it comes to gay marriage, I think it's just a matter of two people being in a civil union, no matter what their orientation. If all the states could come to a logical conclusion, I'd think it would be great to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure. I mean, the constitution shouldn't be amended for every little thing that gets people riled up. It's just not important enough to warrant such a big change.",
            "Honestly, I grew up in a Christian household, and as a result, I've always had a bit of a mixed perspective on homosexuality. On one hand, I have several gay friends, which has broadened my understanding and acceptance. However, I still have some reservations about that lifestyle. Despite my reservations, I think it's essential to let states decide for themselves whether to legalize gay marriage, rather than having the president impose a national policy.\n\nIt's only fair that states take the lead on this issue, given that they have different political leanings, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you live in a state that's predominantly liberal, it's likely that the majority will support gay marriage. I believe it's essential to respect the decision of the state you choose to live in, rather than trying to impose your own views.\n\nMy stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. In my opinion, it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage, based on their own values and priorities.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's unfair for the president to dictate how every state should handle this issue. Since President Bush doesn't live in every state, he shouldn't have the authority to decide how each state should govern itself. Let's face it; he'll be out of office in a few years, and a new president might reverse his policies. I believe that some decisions should be left to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of those decisions.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to have a national ban on gay marriage, as it's an issue that should be decided by each state, taking into account their unique circumstances and values.",
            "I'm not really sure about this, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're essentially sharing it with the world. If school officials are monitoring it, I think it's fair to say they have a right to do so. Even if they're not searching for students under the school's name, they could still access it from their own homes. In the end, it's all about keeping students safe, and if officials can use Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think that's a good thing. \n\nIt's kind of like what I've noticed - if administrators go on Myspace to catch students doing things they shouldn't be, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to make the school a better and safer place. Of course, this raises questions about the balance between monitoring and respecting students' privacy.\n\nThe thing is, when you post something online, it's out there forever. Even if you try to delete it, there's still a risk it could be accessed by the wrong people. I've been there myself - I've been hesitant to post something negative about someone online because I'm afraid it could come back to haunt me later on.\n\nIt's hard to express yourself when you're talking about this kind of thing, but essentially, I think that Myspace is a public space, and if officials can use it to prevent harm, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to keep students safe. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and respecting students' rights.\n\nI don't think officials should just go on Myspace to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, I think that's okay. It's kind of like what my old teacher told me - schools have to take certain measures to ensure student safety, like having lockdown drills in case of an emergency. That's basically what the school officials were doing in this case - they were trying to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.\n\nThat's pretty much it, I think.",
            "Honestly, the Iraq war is a topic that's been on my mind for a while. At first, I was all for it because my personal experience with 9/11 left a strong impression on me. I thought we should go in there and make an impact, but in hindsight, I think we were completely unprepared. We didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions, and we just rushed into it without a solid plan.\n\nLooking back, I believe we made a lot of mistakes. We overlooked the complexities of the situation and the people we were dealing with. It's like we were just reacting on emotions, rather than taking a step back and thinking things through. And now, I'm not sure if we've achieved anything. In fact, I think we might have made things worse.\n\nThe thing is, as long as the Iraqi people are fighting among themselves, they're not going to be a threat to us. So, I don't see how our presence there is making a difference. It's like we're just trying to impose our will on them, but they're not receptive to it. Sometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they're waging war and causing destruction. I don't know, maybe that's just my perception, but it's hard for me to care about what's happening over there right now.\n\nI think we should have just left them alone and let them figure things out for themselves. War is a different beast for them than it is for us. We just can't compare the two. Our goal should have been to get out of there as soon as possible and not try to impose our values on them. We were just looking for revenge, and that's not a solid reason to go to war.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a clear plan. We didn't think about the long-term consequences of our actions, and now we're stuck in a situation that's not going to get better anytime soon. I think we should just cut our losses and get out of there. It's time for us to move on and let the Iraqis deal with their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to evolve and adapt to the changing times. One reason for the decline in its following might be its rather restrictive and outdated views on various subjects. Take, for instance, the Church's stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control – these are issues where the Church's views seem to be stuck in the past. If they could update their perspective and become more accepting of modern ideas, they might not be losing followers.\n\nI've noticed that many people are increasingly alienated from the Church due to its rigid stance on these matters. Those who don't agree with the Church's views on, say, abortion, might find it challenging to be part of a community that actively discourages it. Similarly, individuals who support gay marriage or have similar views might feel unwelcome in a Church that doesn't condone it.\n\nI also think it's time for the Church to reconsider its stance on female priests and married priests. I don't see why priests can't be married or why women can't serve as priests. After all, the Church sees priests as being devoted to a higher authority, but I believe that's no reason to deny them a personal life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family, so why should priests be any different? It's time for the Church to modernize and become more inclusive.",
            "Honestly, I never thought I'd take a strong stance on gay marriage, but I have to admit that I'm not opposed to it. To me, people are either born gay or it's just part of who they are, and it's not something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them accountable for their sexual orientation. In my opinion, it's wrong to say that a man and woman can get married, but a same-sex couple can't. I mean, why should people be judged for who they are? It's not a topic I've given a lot of thought to, but it's clear to me that it's not right to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's worth considering that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can control. Like, I was born straight, and I'm pretty sure people are born gay too. It's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the government should be involved in something like this, as it's not really a legal or moral issue – it's just a matter of people being who they are. I don't think they should be judged or stigmatized for it. The government should just leave people alone and let them live their lives.\n\nIt's hard to understand why the government feels it's necessary to interfere in people's personal lives like this. It's not like it affects national security or anything. They just seem to be overstepping their bounds and imposing their opinions on people who don't really need it. To me, it's about accepting people for who they are and not trying to change them or punish them for being different. That's just not right.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm of the opinion that gay marriage should be legalized. There's not really a solid reason why it shouldn't be. Some people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's a misconception. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're two different things.\n\nThere are many aspects to consider, and it's hard to draw parallels between the two. It's like two sides of the same coin – you can't have one without the other. Civil rights come into play, such as property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit your partner in the hospital. It seems unfair that these rights aren't extended to same-sex couples.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples. It's all about the relationship itself, not the orientation of the individuals involved. The problem lies in the fact that people are getting hung up on the idea of church and state. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nIf we separate church and state, then it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation – separate but unequal. In a legal sense, if you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage? The main points of contention seem to be adoption issues, community concerns, and the potential impact on children raised by gay parents.\n\nSome people worry about how children will adjust to societal norms and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. However, it's hard to say for certain, especially when it comes to adoption. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In places like New York City, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and exclusion in public schools.\n\nUltimately, parenting skills are the same regardless of orientation. It comes down to individual personality choices, not the couple's makeup. I think the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal across the board. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage seem to be rooted in his personal moral code, which is influenced by his religion. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its moral views on the rest of the country, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and the separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has debunked this notion. Instead of listening to popular opinion or personal biases, we should rely on research and studies to inform our views on this issue.",
            "You know, I work at the hospital pharmacy and I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. I mean, it's pretty clear that if it's available for the public, I don't think it's a good idea. No way, not at all. But if we're talking about using it for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, even if something is illegal, it doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's a pretty simple idea, but some people just don't get it.\n\nFor example, there are loads of controlled substances that we use in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're basically off-limits to the public, but we use them all the time because they're actually pretty useful. And if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it, that doesn't make any sense to me. I think we should just accept its potential benefits and not be so judgmental.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think marijuana is that similar to alcohol, even though abusing either one can have negative consequences. But if we're talking about making it legal, I'd say it's better to do it gradually, not all at once. If we just remove the taboo around marijuana and people start to use it responsibly, that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really negative image of marijuana because it's seen as an illicit substance. But the truth is, it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. And if we can change that perception, maybe people will start to use it more sensibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern era. They're no longer as strict as they used to be. I can compare this to my own experiences growing up - I used to attend church every Sunday and get dressed up in matching outfits, but now they've introduced a more casual teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress down, even at the morning masses, and it's not uncommon to see families rushing in late or wearing beachwear. I think this shift towards casualness is a big change.\n\nTo be honest, that's the most noticeable thing to me about the church I'm familiar with. I'm not sure about the church's internal politics, but that's pretty much it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind lately is the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think these issues would have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Some men who are married still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not necessarily about their marital status. It's about the individual's character. I also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone wants to practice their faith while being married, they might consider a different religion. For example, some denominations allow their clergy to be married.\n\nIn my opinion, it's the individual's genetics that determine their sexuality, not their upbringing. I don't think people just develop these tendencies; they're born with them. You can't hide that through a marriage, and it's likely to come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done much to prevent these issues from happening. If they did know about it and tried to cover it up, that's a different story altogether, but I don't think that was always the case.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have anything to add.",
            "I mean, I was initially okay with the idea of the war, but I strongly felt that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and that we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext, with a bunch of pretexts leading us there. \n\nI think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which we later found out was all a lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. \n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who made that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. It's clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. \n\nIt's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he was also hoping to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nI think the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now would probably lead to chaos and more deaths, as the country could slide into civil war. The alternative being considered now is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either, as it would raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and could lead to more problems in the long run. \n\nThe interim government is failing, and the Parliament isn't effective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the political process. Even the anti-American cleric, Muktada al-Sadr, has a significant presence in the Parliament now, and there are still radical elements vying for control of the government, causing a lot of friction in the political process. \n\nHonestly, I don't have a solution that I can articulate without offending anyone.",
            "I'm thinking about the War in Iraq, and it's not easy to form a clear opinion. I mean, it's not even considered a declared war. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, kind of like in the US, and also to gain access to their oil resources. But the problem is, it's causing a lot of tension and upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to try to build democracy, which is a long-term process that can't be rushed. And if we leave, the Iraqis might be angry that we messed things up and they'll have to start from scratch. This whole situation is really complicated.\n\nI think the war is hard to wrap my head around, and I'm not sure what to say. I don't really know much about it. Do you have any other topics we can discuss?\n\nBut, if I'm being honest, I think the war should continue, but only because people are being forced to fight. I don't think we should call it a war anymore, though. I think it's more about showing off our military strength and power. It never should have been called a war in the first place, since it was never officially declared by Congress. You have to declare a war through Congress to make it official.\n\nI think we should be helping Iraq, but it's also a waste of our resources. And especially now, with Bush being president, it's making him look really bad. He's getting a bad reputation because of the war's impact and the way it's affecting people. Remember the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless conflict. I don't want Bush to be known as the president who started another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to be safe, but at the same time, I don't think we should be trying to mold them into a second US, which would only make things worse. The culture is so different, and I'm worried that our attempts to change them will only fuel more hatred towards the US. The Al-Qaeda situation will probably get worse, and we'll be stuck in a never-ending conflict.\n\nI think this whole situation will drag on for years to come. That's my take on it, I guess.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with making it a law or even letting the government decide it's legal. I think it's something that should be up to the churches, considering what the constitution says about separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that this is something that's already been stated and established. Trying to exert any kind of control over it would be a pretty big defiance of the constitution's principles.\n\nI think the people pushing to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what's allowed or not for the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, and it's what allows for religious tolerance in the US. I think trying to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government, which I don't think is right at all.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, and it's basically showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the government, and there's no real reason to back it up other than personal views.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see how it would have a major impact on the economy or anything else. If anything, it might even have a positive impact on society. I'm not sure how, but I think it could be a good thing.\n\nI've pretty much said it all, so I'm not sure I have much more to add.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely truthful about the reasons for going to war before invading the country. I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it wasn't as directly related as they made it out to be. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using the outrage from the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war.\n\nI personally oppose war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would occur.\n\nThey're trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted to do in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult process, and not a clear-cut victory. It's hard to fight an insurgency when you're fighting against the citizens of the country, not a traditional army.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes and been more prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. They weren't, and now we're still in Iraq, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. We're still training the Iraqi troops and police to take control of their own country, which is a long process.\n\nI believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn't be so naive about the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful. Democracy was a long struggle in our own country, and it's not an easy thing to achieve.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you consider the number of American casualties and the cost of continuing the war. I think we should try to see it through, but it's also important to consider the human cost and the question of whether it's worth it.\n\nOne of my concerns is that the war in Iraq is partly about oil and controlling resources. We invaded Iraq supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but we're not doing the same thing in other countries with similar issues. I think the US government isn't being entirely truthful about their motives and decisions.\n\nLet's hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon.",
            "I mean, I'm for gay marriage, and I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been shown to be biological rather than a result of societal influences. I think it's unfair to deprive people of rights due to something they can't control, which is their sexual orientation. It's almost inhumane, and I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this, it's a personal, household-level issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily business, and it's no different from any other family.\n\nI think it's ridiculous that Bush is trying to impose his interpretation of marriage on everyone else. It's clear that there's a biological component to being gay, and it's not something people choose. Research suggests that there's a chemical aspect to it, something people are predisposed to, rather than a result of their upbringing or environment.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's publicly scrutinized. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without drawing attention to themselves, but if a same-sex couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a major news event. It's just not right.",
            "Uh, I mean, when you post something online, it becomes public knowledge. It's completely out there, and you can't take it back. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. Once you share something online, it can shape people's perceptions of you, and that's a fact.\n\nIf you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably respond, and it can get out of hand. The internet is a public forum, and if you're connected to that person on social media, you'll likely see their messages. It's not the school that receives the message; it's someone who's seen it and decides to report it.\n\nSchool administrators have to act on it because they can't just ignore it, or they might miss an opportunity to prevent something serious from happening. It's a tough call, because you don't always know what to take seriously – it could be a joke or a serious threat.\n\nIn a recent situation, someone overheard a friend talking about something, and when we looked into it, we found some concerning posts on their social media account. It's a bit of a double-edged sword: you can't control what people think, and you can't dictate what they take seriously. If you don't want something shared, don't put it online.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media or snoop through their accounts. If something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously, but that's different from monitoring personal conversations or messages. It's a fine line to walk.\n\nI think it's a good idea for teachers to avoid creating fake social media accounts to friend their students – it's not a good idea for them to know that kind of information about their residents, and it's not their place to intervene. It's a delicate situation, and I'm not sure what the best approach is.",
            "I think the war has dragged out for far too long. Initially, the intention was good - to restore democracy in another country. However, we seem to have lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It's as if we're just doing it to prove our power, rather than to achieve a genuine purpose. I'm also concerned that the original motives were questionable, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn all honesty, I believe that if the goal was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. But I do think the war has gone on for far too long. I think we made our point in the initial stages of the conflict, with the invasion itself serving as a powerful statement. However, the fact that it's dragged on for years has made it seem like we're fighting just for the sake of fighting.\n\nIf our original intention was to free a country from tyranny, that would be a noble cause. But over time, our reasons for being there seem to have become distorted and misguided. It feels like we're still at war because we don't want to admit defeat or back down. I genuinely believe that the war has gone on long enough and it's time to bring it to an end.\n\nWe've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's not even benefiting us in the long run. We have our own problems to address, such as poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare, which could be better funded with that money. It's frustrating to think that our own citizens are being put in harm's way in a war that we're no longer fighting for a clear purpose.",
            "I have a question that I want to clarify. I was wondering if it's okay to ask, it was prevented because someone went online and found a particular issue. To be honest, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nWhen you post information on the internet, you have to accept that it's available for everyone to see. For example, on social media sites like Myspace, if you want to view someone's profile, you usually have to be their friend or join the site, which means you've given permission for them to see your profile. It's like you're giving them access to your online space.\n\nI think it's a good thing that someone was able to see this information and prevent a serious situation from happening. However, it also raises some concerns about overreach and potential discrimination. If someone is constantly monitoring students' online profiles, it could be seen as unfair.\n\nI'm not sure how this situation would work in practice. Would they be monitoring everyone's profiles, or just looking for specific information? It's a tricky issue because it's hard to balance the need for safety with the need for personal freedom. I've had my own experiences with online safety, having a Facebook account and being aware of the potential risks. I've seen cases where people have been able to gather a lot of information about someone just by looking at their online profiles.\n\nIt's a bit unsettling, to be honest. I've tried to limit the information I share online, but I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a delicate balance between being open and being safe.\n\nI heard about a case where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed a bit extreme to me. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure what the right approach is.",
            "I guess I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, but I'm going to go ahead and share my thoughts on it. I mean, I was against the war from the start, but it's not really a big deal now since everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who don't want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nLooking at recent polls, it's clear that the majority of people worldwide think the war was a bad idea. In fact, over 75 to 80% of the global population agrees with this. This includes the Iraqi people, who are the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and an astonishing 70 to 80% of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it was a dumb idea and that we should leave within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the very beginning, and now that we're trying to pull out, it's going to be a disaster as well. I think the problem lies in the cultural gap between the US and the Middle East, and the US administration's idea of imposing democracy on a region that wouldn't choose it for itself. I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, but it's not that simple. Before invading, we should have weighed the pros and cons, considering the potential consequences of turning Iraq into a disaster zone.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for staying, and concerns about what might happen if we leave, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't leave now.\n\nIt's worth noting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight. If we ask them if we should stay and they say no, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We could at least say we were trying to help, but they made the decision to leave.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, and I don't think we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least if we leave, it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "You know, I really think that gender discrimination is still a big issue in the US. I mean, it's not just about women, it's about the specific job or field you're in. For instance, women often face it more because of the \"glass ceiling\" - even when equality is supposed to exist, it can be tough for them to break through and get ahead. This is because society has been conditioned to think a certain way for so long, and it's hard to change.\n\nTake workplaces for example. Women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because it's not the norm for women to be in top positions. It's the same with men in industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. Society looks down on men who choose to be stay-at-home dads, thinking they should be the breadwinner. It's hard on them because they might have always wanted to spend time with their kids and be a part of their lives.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are straight can often be stereotyped and looked down upon. People might think, \"If you're a man in fashion, you must be doing it for women.\" It's like, how do we know what your style is like just because you're a guy? Depending on the job or field, there's definitely gender discrimination going on.\n\nIt's tough to change this mindset because society has a set way of thinking, and it's only moving slowly. But we're making progress, and women are getting more accepted in the business world and becoming CEOs. Men who are stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted. It's a slow process, but it's happening.\n\nI think the key is to promote the qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, where it's starting to become more accepted. I'm not sure what more we can do that isn't already being done, because if we move too fast, people will resist. Change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, though - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their background. If someone has a strong accent or hasn't had the best education, but is still super intelligent, they might be discriminated against by others who think they can't be taken seriously. It's not just a one-way street, and it's not just about gender.",
            "To be honest, I think the laws surrounding it are a bit confusing. My understanding is that they didn't fully legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means it's more like a traffic ticket, something you get cited for rather than being arrested and charged with a crime. \n\nI think one of the major concerns people have is the long-term consequences of getting caught with a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized. These consequences can still affect job interviews and other areas of life. However, on the other hand, not arresting people and going through the whole process can be quite costly for municipalities, which might be a reason some places don't want to make the change. \n\nIn places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I think decriminalization is a good idea. It's freed up money that can be spent on more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. \n\nIt's not a simple issue, though. While marijuana might not be as bad as some people think, there are still concerns about its widespread availability and how it might affect people's behavior. Some people might be worried about the potential for it to be smoked in public, which could be awkward for those who don't approve. \n\nIt's also worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to substances. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. \n\nOverall, I think it's a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "I agree that the Catholic Church has many traditional practices, which are good to hold onto, but also essential to adapt to change. Many Catholics attend Church every week and follow the doctrine strictly, yet sometimes it seems like the Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. It's hypocritical to teach love and acceptance while not accepting others who don't adhere to the same beliefs, especially when it comes to other religions. For instance, my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their different faiths. This lack of acceptance makes me question the Church's tolerance.\n\nIt's not just the doctrine that's a problem; the Church's practice often contradicts its teachings. The Church sticks to outdated traditions even when they no longer serve a purpose. I believe it's essential to reevaluate and update these practices to be more inclusive and accepting. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I don't think it would necessarily prevent pedophilia. Molesting children is a separate issue from marriage, and people who engage in such behavior will likely do so regardless of their marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not address the root problem, and I believe it's not a solution to the issue at hand.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this issue, to be honest.  I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong, but I do think this is a really tough topic to tackle. The line between church and state is already pretty blurry, and defining marriage is a minefield in itself. It's hard to navigate without stepping on anyone's toes. To be frank, I'm not sure what I think, but I'm starting to lean towards the idea that civil unions should be the focus. I mean, why should the government care about the specifics of a marriage, as long as it's a union between two consenting adults? It's not about the sacrament or the church; it's about two people coming together. And if we're being strict about it, civil unions would be a more accurate label, as it's the government that recognizes the union, not the church. Now, when it comes to gay marriage, I think it's just a matter of two people being in a civil union, no matter what their orientation. If all the states could come to a logical conclusion, I'd think it would be great to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure. I mean, the constitution shouldn't be amended for every little thing that gets people riled up. It's just not important enough to warrant such a big change.",
            "Honestly, I grew up in a Christian household, and as a result, I've always had a bit of a mixed perspective on homosexuality. On one hand, I have several gay friends, which has broadened my understanding and acceptance. However, I still have some reservations about that lifestyle. Despite my reservations, I think it's essential to let states decide for themselves whether to legalize gay marriage, rather than having the president impose a national policy.\n\nIt's only fair that states take the lead on this issue, given that they have different political leanings, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you live in a state that's predominantly liberal, it's likely that the majority will support gay marriage. I believe it's essential to respect the decision of the state you choose to live in, rather than trying to impose your own views.\n\nMy stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. In my opinion, it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage, based on their own values and priorities.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's unfair for the president to dictate how every state should handle this issue. Since President Bush doesn't live in every state, he shouldn't have the authority to decide how each state should govern itself. Let's face it; he'll be out of office in a few years, and a new president might reverse his policies. I believe that some decisions should be left to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of those decisions.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to have a national ban on gay marriage, as it's an issue that should be decided by each state, taking into account their unique circumstances and values.",
            "I'm not really sure about this, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're essentially sharing it with the world. If school officials are monitoring it, I think it's fair to say they have a right to do so. Even if they're not searching for students under the school's name, they could still access it from their own homes. In the end, it's all about keeping students safe, and if officials can use Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think that's a good thing. \n\nIt's kind of like what I've noticed - if administrators go on Myspace to catch students doing things they shouldn't be, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to make the school a better and safer place. Of course, this raises questions about the balance between monitoring and respecting students' privacy.\n\nThe thing is, when you post something online, it's out there forever. Even if you try to delete it, there's still a risk it could be accessed by the wrong people. I've been there myself - I've been hesitant to post something negative about someone online because I'm afraid it could come back to haunt me later on.\n\nIt's hard to express yourself when you're talking about this kind of thing, but essentially, I think that Myspace is a public space, and if officials can use it to prevent harm, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to keep students safe. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and respecting students' rights.\n\nI don't think officials should just go on Myspace to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, I think that's okay. It's kind of like what my old teacher told me - schools have to take certain measures to ensure student safety, like having lockdown drills in case of an emergency. That's basically what the school officials were doing in this case - they were trying to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.\n\nThat's pretty much it, I think.",
            "Honestly, the Iraq war is a topic that's been on my mind for a while. At first, I was all for it because my personal experience with 9/11 left a strong impression on me. I thought we should go in there and make an impact, but in hindsight, I think we were completely unprepared. We didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions, and we just rushed into it without a solid plan.\n\nLooking back, I believe we made a lot of mistakes. We overlooked the complexities of the situation and the people we were dealing with. It's like we were just reacting on emotions, rather than taking a step back and thinking things through. And now, I'm not sure if we've achieved anything. In fact, I think we might have made things worse.\n\nThe thing is, as long as the Iraqi people are fighting among themselves, they're not going to be a threat to us. So, I don't see how our presence there is making a difference. It's like we're just trying to impose our will on them, but they're not receptive to it. Sometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they're waging war and causing destruction. I don't know, maybe that's just my perception, but it's hard for me to care about what's happening over there right now.\n\nI think we should have just left them alone and let them figure things out for themselves. War is a different beast for them than it is for us. We just can't compare the two. Our goal should have been to get out of there as soon as possible and not try to impose our values on them. We were just looking for revenge, and that's not a solid reason to go to war.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a clear plan. We didn't think about the long-term consequences of our actions, and now we're stuck in a situation that's not going to get better anytime soon. I think we should just cut our losses and get out of there. It's time for us to move on and let the Iraqis deal with their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to evolve and adapt to the changing times. One reason for the decline in its following might be its rather restrictive and outdated views on various subjects. Take, for instance, the Church's stance on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control – these are issues where the Church's views seem to be stuck in the past. If they could update their perspective and become more accepting of modern ideas, they might not be losing followers.\n\nI've noticed that many people are increasingly alienated from the Church due to its rigid stance on these matters. Those who don't agree with the Church's views on, say, abortion, might find it challenging to be part of a community that actively discourages it. Similarly, individuals who support gay marriage or have similar views might feel unwelcome in a Church that doesn't condone it.\n\nI also think it's time for the Church to reconsider its stance on female priests and married priests. I don't see why priests can't be married or why women can't serve as priests. After all, the Church sees priests as being devoted to a higher authority, but I believe that's no reason to deny them a personal life. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family, so why should priests be any different? It's time for the Church to modernize and become more inclusive.",
            "Honestly, I never thought I'd take a strong stance on gay marriage, but I have to admit that I'm not opposed to it. To me, people are either born gay or it's just part of who they are, and it's not something they consciously choose. I think it's unfair to hold them accountable for their sexual orientation. In my opinion, it's wrong to say that a man and woman can get married, but a same-sex couple can't. I mean, why should people be judged for who they are? It's not a topic I've given a lot of thought to, but it's clear to me that it's not right to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's worth considering that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can control. Like, I was born straight, and I'm pretty sure people are born gay too. It's not like they have a choice in the matter. I don't think the government should be involved in something like this, as it's not really a legal or moral issue – it's just a matter of people being who they are. I don't think they should be judged or stigmatized for it. The government should just leave people alone and let them live their lives.\n\nIt's hard to understand why the government feels it's necessary to interfere in people's personal lives like this. It's not like it affects national security or anything. They just seem to be overstepping their bounds and imposing their opinions on people who don't really need it. To me, it's about accepting people for who they are and not trying to change them or punish them for being different. That's just not right.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm of the opinion that gay marriage should be legalized. There's not really a solid reason why it shouldn't be. Some people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's a misconception. It's like comparing apples and oranges – they're two different things.\n\nThere are many aspects to consider, and it's hard to draw parallels between the two. It's like two sides of the same coin – you can't have one without the other. Civil rights come into play, such as property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit your partner in the hospital. It seems unfair that these rights aren't extended to same-sex couples.\n\nScientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as heterosexual couples. It's all about the relationship itself, not the orientation of the individuals involved. The problem lies in the fact that people are getting hung up on the idea of church and state. Gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nIf we separate church and state, then it shouldn't be an issue. It's like segregation – separate but unequal. In a legal sense, if you're allowing a civil union, why not a marriage? The main points of contention seem to be adoption issues, community concerns, and the potential impact on children raised by gay parents.\n\nSome people worry about how children will adjust to societal norms and whether they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. However, it's hard to say for certain, especially when it comes to adoption. The main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In places like New York City, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and exclusion in public schools.\n\nUltimately, parenting skills are the same regardless of orientation. It comes down to individual personality choices, not the couple's makeup. I think the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal across the board. The amendment should be the opposite of what it is now.\n\nPresident Bush's views on gay marriage seem to be rooted in his personal moral code, which is influenced by his religion. However, morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its moral views on the rest of the country, especially when it comes to issues like the Pledge of Allegiance and the separation of church and state.\n\nSome people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has debunked this notion. Instead of listening to popular opinion or personal biases, we should rely on research and studies to inform our views on this issue.",
            "You know, I work at the hospital pharmacy and I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. I mean, it's pretty clear that if it's available for the public, I don't think it's a good idea. No way, not at all. But if we're talking about using it for medical purposes, I think it's a different story. I mean, even if something is illegal, it doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's a pretty simple idea, but some people just don't get it.\n\nFor example, there are loads of controlled substances that we use in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're basically off-limits to the public, but we use them all the time because they're actually pretty useful. And if we deny the benefits of marijuana just because there's a stigma around it, that doesn't make any sense to me. I think we should just accept its potential benefits and not be so judgmental.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think marijuana is that similar to alcohol, even though abusing either one can have negative consequences. But if we're talking about making it legal, I'd say it's better to do it gradually, not all at once. If we just remove the taboo around marijuana and people start to use it responsibly, that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nThe thing is, people have this really negative image of marijuana because it's seen as an illicit substance. But the truth is, it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. And if we can change that perception, maybe people will start to use it more sensibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern era. They're no longer as strict as they used to be. I can compare this to my own experiences growing up - I used to attend church every Sunday and get dressed up in matching outfits, but now they've introduced a more casual teenager mass that's only 30 minutes long. People dress down, even at the morning masses, and it's not uncommon to see families rushing in late or wearing beachwear. I think this shift towards casualness is a big change.\n\nTo be honest, that's the most noticeable thing to me about the church I'm familiar with. I'm not sure about the church's internal politics, but that's pretty much it.\n\nOne thing that's been on my mind lately is the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia. I don't think these issues would have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. Some men who are married still develop an attraction to young kids, so it's not necessarily about their marital status. It's about the individual's character. I also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone wants to practice their faith while being married, they might consider a different religion. For example, some denominations allow their clergy to be married.\n\nIn my opinion, it's the individual's genetics that determine their sexuality, not their upbringing. I don't think people just develop these tendencies; they're born with them. You can't hide that through a marriage, and it's likely to come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done much to prevent these issues from happening. If they did know about it and tried to cover it up, that's a different story altogether, but I don't think that was always the case.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic church, I don't really have anything to add.",
            "I mean, I was initially okay with the idea of the war, but I strongly felt that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and that we kind of jumped into Iraq as a pretext, with a bunch of pretexts leading us there. \n\nI think the Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which we later found out was all a lie. That really rubbed me the wrong way and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. \n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who made that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time he presented it. To me, that's a serious breach of trust and an impeachable offense. It's clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since 9/11. \n\nIt's my opinion that they came into office with the intention of going to war. I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and he was also hoping to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things. \n\nI think the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now would probably lead to chaos and more deaths, as the country could slide into civil war. The alternative being considered now is a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia trying to restore order, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either, as it would raise issues about Iraq's sovereignty and could lead to more problems in the long run. \n\nThe interim government is failing, and the Parliament isn't effective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the political process. Even the anti-American cleric, Muktada al-Sadr, has a significant presence in the Parliament now, and there are still radical elements vying for control of the government, causing a lot of friction in the political process. \n\nHonestly, I don't have a solution that I can articulate without offending anyone.",
            "I'm thinking about the War in Iraq, and it's not easy to form a clear opinion. I mean, it's not even considered a declared war. It feels like we're just trying to get back at Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like we're over there trying to establish democracy, kind of like in the US, and also to gain access to their oil resources. But the problem is, it's causing a lot of tension and upset.\n\nIf we stay, we'll have to try to build democracy, which is a long-term process that can't be rushed. And if we leave, the Iraqis might be angry that we messed things up and they'll have to start from scratch. This whole situation is really complicated.\n\nI think the war is hard to wrap my head around, and I'm not sure what to say. I don't really know much about it. Do you have any other topics we can discuss?\n\nBut, if I'm being honest, I think the war should continue, but only because people are being forced to fight. I don't think we should call it a war anymore, though. I think it's more about showing off our military strength and power. It never should have been called a war in the first place, since it was never officially declared by Congress. You have to declare a war through Congress to make it official.\n\nI think we should be helping Iraq, but it's also a waste of our resources. And especially now, with Bush being president, it's making him look really bad. He's getting a bad reputation because of the war's impact and the way it's affecting people. Remember the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now considered a meaningless conflict. I don't want Bush to be known as the president who started another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard to say I want the war to end, though, because there are so many families with loved ones in Iraq. I want them to be safe, but at the same time, I don't think we should be trying to mold them into a second US, which would only make things worse. The culture is so different, and I'm worried that our attempts to change them will only fuel more hatred towards the US. The Al-Qaeda situation will probably get worse, and we'll be stuck in a never-ending conflict.\n\nI think this whole situation will drag on for years to come. That's my take on it, I guess.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure I agree with making it a law or even letting the government decide it's legal. I think it's something that should be up to the churches, considering what the constitution says about separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that this is something that's already been stated and established. Trying to exert any kind of control over it would be a pretty big defiance of the constitution's principles.\n\nI think the people pushing to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what's allowed or not for the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, and it's what allows for religious tolerance in the US. I think trying to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government, which I don't think is right at all.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, and it's basically showing a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the government, and there's no real reason to back it up other than personal views.\n\nTo be honest, I don't see how it would have a major impact on the economy or anything else. If anything, it might even have a positive impact on society. I'm not sure how, but I think it could be a good thing.\n\nI've pretty much said it all, so I'm not sure I have much more to add.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. To be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely truthful about the reasons for going to war before invading the country. I believe they tried to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but it wasn't as directly related as they made it out to be. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using the outrage from the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war.\n\nI personally oppose war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died in the war, which is absolutely heartbreaking. The US government removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would occur.\n\nThey're trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted to do in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult process, and not a clear-cut victory. It's hard to fight an insurgency when you're fighting against the citizens of the country, not a traditional army.\n\nI think the government should have planned for all possible outcomes and been more prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. They weren't, and now we're still in Iraq, almost at the end of 2006, and many American troops are still dying. We're still training the Iraqi troops and police to take control of their own country, which is a long process.\n\nI believe the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn't be so naive about the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful. Democracy was a long struggle in our own country, and it's not an easy thing to achieve.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you consider the number of American casualties and the cost of continuing the war. I think we should try to see it through, but it's also important to consider the human cost and the question of whether it's worth it.\n\nOne of my concerns is that the war in Iraq is partly about oil and controlling resources. We invaded Iraq supposedly to make it a democratic nation, but we're not doing the same thing in other countries with similar issues. I think the US government isn't being entirely truthful about their motives and decisions.\n\nLet's hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there's peace in the region. Unfortunately, I don't think that's likely to happen anytime soon.",
            "I mean, I'm for gay marriage, and I've always been. It's a personal preference, and it's something that's been shown to be biological rather than a result of societal influences. I think it's unfair to deprive people of rights due to something they can't control, which is their sexual orientation. It's almost inhumane, and I've always been a supporter of gay marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or government should have a say in this, it's a personal, household-level issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to, but they live their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily business, and it's no different from any other family.\n\nI think it's ridiculous that Bush is trying to impose his interpretation of marriage on everyone else. It's clear that there's a biological component to being gay, and it's not something people choose. Research suggests that there's a chemical aspect to it, something people are predisposed to, rather than a result of their upbringing or environment.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private, personal matter, not something that's publicly scrutinized. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do it privately, without drawing attention to themselves, but if a same-sex couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a major news event. It's just not right.",
            "Uh, I mean, when you post something online, it becomes public knowledge. It's completely out there, and you can't take it back. As an R.A., I've already dealt with this issue. Once you share something online, it can shape people's perceptions of you, and that's a fact.\n\nIf you're talking about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably respond, and it can get out of hand. The internet is a public forum, and if you're connected to that person on social media, you'll likely see their messages. It's not the school that receives the message; it's someone who's seen it and decides to report it.\n\nSchool administrators have to act on it because they can't just ignore it, or they might miss an opportunity to prevent something serious from happening. It's a tough call, because you don't always know what to take seriously – it could be a joke or a serious threat.\n\nIn a recent situation, someone overheard a friend talking about something, and when we looked into it, we found some concerning posts on their social media account. It's a bit of a double-edged sword: you can't control what people think, and you can't dictate what they take seriously. If you don't want something shared, don't put it online.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media or snoop through their accounts. If something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously, but that's different from monitoring personal conversations or messages. It's a fine line to walk.\n\nI think it's a good idea for teachers to avoid creating fake social media accounts to friend their students – it's not a good idea for them to know that kind of information about their residents, and it's not their place to intervene. It's a delicate situation, and I'm not sure what the best approach is.",
            "I think the war has dragged out for far too long. Initially, the intention was good - to restore democracy in another country. However, we seem to have lost sight of that goal and are now fighting for reasons that aren't entirely clear. It's as if we're just doing it to prove our power, rather than to achieve a genuine purpose. I'm also concerned that the original motives were questionable, considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn all honesty, I believe that if the goal was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. But I do think the war has gone on for far too long. I think we made our point in the initial stages of the conflict, with the invasion itself serving as a powerful statement. However, the fact that it's dragged on for years has made it seem like we're fighting just for the sake of fighting.\n\nIf our original intention was to free a country from tyranny, that would be a noble cause. But over time, our reasons for being there seem to have become distorted and misguided. It feels like we're still at war because we don't want to admit defeat or back down. I genuinely believe that the war has gone on long enough and it's time to bring it to an end.\n\nWe've been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on a war that's not even benefiting us in the long run. We have our own problems to address, such as poverty, public infrastructure, and healthcare, which could be better funded with that money. It's frustrating to think that our own citizens are being put in harm's way in a war that we're no longer fighting for a clear purpose.",
            "I have a question that I want to clarify. I was wondering if it's okay to ask, it was prevented because someone went online and found a particular issue. To be honest, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\n\nWhen you post information on the internet, you have to accept that it's available for everyone to see. For example, on social media sites like Myspace, if you want to view someone's profile, you usually have to be their friend or join the site, which means you've given permission for them to see your profile. It's like you're giving them access to your online space.\n\nI think it's a good thing that someone was able to see this information and prevent a serious situation from happening. However, it also raises some concerns about overreach and potential discrimination. If someone is constantly monitoring students' online profiles, it could be seen as unfair.\n\nI'm not sure how this situation would work in practice. Would they be monitoring everyone's profiles, or just looking for specific information? It's a tricky issue because it's hard to balance the need for safety with the need for personal freedom. I've had my own experiences with online safety, having a Facebook account and being aware of the potential risks. I've seen cases where people have been able to gather a lot of information about someone just by looking at their online profiles.\n\nIt's a bit unsettling, to be honest. I've tried to limit the information I share online, but I also want to be able to connect with my friends. It's a delicate balance between being open and being safe.\n\nI heard about a case where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed a bit extreme to me. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure what the right approach is.",
            "I guess I feel a bit hypocritical talking about the Iraq War, but I'm going to go ahead and share my thoughts on it. I mean, I was against the war from the start, but it's not really a big deal now since everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who don't want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nLooking at recent polls, it's clear that the majority of people worldwide think the war was a bad idea. In fact, over 75 to 80% of the global population agrees with this. This includes the Iraqi people, who are the ones we're supposedly trying to help, and an astonishing 70 to 80% of US troops stationed in Iraq, who think it was a dumb idea and that we should leave within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the very beginning, and now that we're trying to pull out, it's going to be a disaster as well. I think the problem lies in the cultural gap between the US and the Middle East, and the US administration's idea of imposing democracy on a region that wouldn't choose it for itself. I mean, Saddam was a bad guy, but it's not that simple. Before invading, we should have weighed the pros and cons, considering the potential consequences of turning Iraq into a disaster zone.\n\nI don't see any reason to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary. The administration might have some hopeful ideas for staying, and concerns about what might happen if we leave, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our continued presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't leave now.\n\nIt's worth noting that over 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinions should carry some weight. If we ask them if we should stay and they say no, then it's not our fault if things go wrong. We could at least say we were trying to help, but they made the decision to leave.\n\nIt's a complicated situation, and I don't think we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but at least if we leave, it'll be better than where we stand now.",
            "You know, I really think that gender discrimination is still a big issue in the US. I mean, it's not just about women, it's about the specific job or field you're in. For instance, women often face it more because of the \"glass ceiling\" - even when equality is supposed to exist, it can be tough for them to break through and get ahead. This is because society has been conditioned to think a certain way for so long, and it's hard to change.\n\nTake workplaces for example. Women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because it's not the norm for women to be in top positions. It's the same with men in industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. Society looks down on men who choose to be stay-at-home dads, thinking they should be the breadwinner. It's hard on them because they might have always wanted to spend time with their kids and be a part of their lives.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are straight can often be stereotyped and looked down upon. People might think, \"If you're a man in fashion, you must be doing it for women.\" It's like, how do we know what your style is like just because you're a guy? Depending on the job or field, there's definitely gender discrimination going on.\n\nIt's tough to change this mindset because society has a set way of thinking, and it's only moving slowly. But we're making progress, and women are getting more accepted in the business world and becoming CEOs. Men who are stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted. It's a slow process, but it's happening.\n\nI think the key is to promote the qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, where it's starting to become more accepted. I'm not sure what more we can do that isn't already being done, because if we move too fast, people will resist. Change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, though - people can be discriminated against based on where they're from or their background. If someone has a strong accent or hasn't had the best education, but is still super intelligent, they might be discriminated against by others who think they can't be taken seriously. It's not just a one-way street, and it's not just about gender.",
            "To be honest, I think the laws surrounding it are a bit confusing. My understanding is that they didn't fully legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. This means it's more like a traffic ticket, something you get cited for rather than being arrested and charged with a crime. \n\nI think one of the major concerns people have is the long-term consequences of getting caught with a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized. These consequences can still affect job interviews and other areas of life. However, on the other hand, not arresting people and going through the whole process can be quite costly for municipalities, which might be a reason some places don't want to make the change. \n\nIn places like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, I think decriminalization is a good idea. It's freed up money that can be spent on more important things like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. \n\nIt's not a simple issue, though. While marijuana might not be as bad as some people think, there are still concerns about its widespread availability and how it might affect people's behavior. Some people might be worried about the potential for it to be smoked in public, which could be awkward for those who don't approve. \n\nIt's also worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have their own negative effects, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to substances. Some people can handle things well, while others can't. \n\nOverall, I think it's a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "I agree that the Catholic Church has many traditional practices, which are good to hold onto, but also essential to adapt to change. Many Catholics attend Church every week and follow the doctrine strictly, yet sometimes it seems like the Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. It's hypocritical to teach love and acceptance while not accepting others who don't adhere to the same beliefs, especially when it comes to other religions. For instance, my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their different faiths. This lack of acceptance makes me question the Church's tolerance.\n\nIt's not just the doctrine that's a problem; the Church's practice often contradicts its teachings. The Church sticks to outdated traditions even when they no longer serve a purpose. I believe it's essential to reevaluate and update these practices to be more inclusive and accepting. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I don't think it would necessarily prevent pedophilia. Molesting children is a separate issue from marriage, and people who engage in such behavior will likely do so regardless of their marital status. Allowing priests to marry might not address the root problem, and I believe it's not a solution to the issue at hand.",
            "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this issue, to be honest.  I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong, but I do think this is a really tough topic to tackle. The line between church and state is already pretty blurry, and defining marriage is a minefield in itself. It's hard to navigate without stepping on anyone's toes. To be frank, I'm not sure what I think, but I'm starting to lean towards the idea that civil unions should be the focus. I mean, why should the government care about the specifics of a marriage, as long as it's a union between two consenting adults? It's not about the sacrament or the church; it's about two people coming together. And if we're being strict about it, civil unions would be a more accurate label, as it's the government that recognizes the union, not the church. Now, when it comes to gay marriage, I think it's just a matter of two people being in a civil union, no matter what their orientation. If all the states could come to a logical conclusion, I'd think it would be great to make it a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure. I mean, the constitution shouldn't be amended for every little thing that gets people riled up. It's just not important enough to warrant such a big change.",
            "Honestly, I grew up in a Christian household, and as a result, I've always had a bit of a mixed perspective on homosexuality. On one hand, I have several gay friends, which has broadened my understanding and acceptance. However, I still have some reservations about that lifestyle. Despite my reservations, I think it's essential to let states decide for themselves whether to legalize gay marriage, rather than having the president impose a national policy.\n\nIt's only fair that states take the lead on this issue, given that they have different political leanings, with some being more liberal and others more conservative. If you live in a state that's predominantly liberal, it's likely that the majority will support gay marriage. I believe it's essential to respect the decision of the state you choose to live in, rather than trying to impose your own views.\n\nMy stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. In my opinion, it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage, based on their own values and priorities.\n\nTo be honest, I think it's unfair for the president to dictate how every state should handle this issue. Since President Bush doesn't live in every state, he shouldn't have the authority to decide how each state should govern itself. Let's face it; he'll be out of office in a few years, and a new president might reverse his policies. I believe that some decisions should be left to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the consequences of those decisions.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to have a national ban on gay marriage, as it's an issue that should be decided by each state, taking into account their unique circumstances and values.",
            "I'm not really sure about this, but let me try to break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and by posting something there, you're essentially sharing it with the world. If school officials are monitoring it, I think it's fair to say they have a right to do so. Even if they're not searching for students under the school's name, they could still access it from their own homes. In the end, it's all about keeping students safe, and if officials can use Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think that's a good thing. \n\nIt's kind of like what I've noticed - if administrators go on Myspace to catch students doing things they shouldn't be, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to make the school a better and safer place. Of course, this raises questions about the balance between monitoring and respecting students' privacy.\n\nThe thing is, when you post something online, it's out there forever. Even if you try to delete it, there's still a risk it could be accessed by the wrong people. I've been there myself - I've been hesitant to post something negative about someone online because I'm afraid it could come back to haunt me later on.\n\nIt's hard to express yourself when you're talking about this kind of thing, but essentially, I think that Myspace is a public space, and if officials can use it to prevent harm, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. It's more like they're doing their job to keep students safe. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and respecting students' rights.\n\nI don't think officials should just go on Myspace to catch students, but if they have a legitimate reason to do so, I think that's okay. It's kind of like what my old teacher told me - schools have to take certain measures to ensure student safety, like having lockdown drills in case of an emergency. That's basically what the school officials were doing in this case - they were trying to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.\n\nThat's pretty much it, I think.",
            "Honestly, the Iraq war is a topic that's been on my mind for a while. At first, I was all for it because my personal experience with 9/11 left a strong impression on me. I thought we should go in there and make an impact, but in hindsight, I think we were completely unprepared. We didn't think through the long-term consequences of our actions, and we just rushed into it without a solid plan.\n\nLooking back, I believe we made a lot of mistakes. We overlooked the complexities of the situation and the people we were dealing with. It's like we were just reacting on emotions, rather than taking a step back and thinking things through. And now, I'm not sure if we've achieved anything. In fact, I think we might have made things worse.\n\nThe thing is, as long as the Iraqi people are fighting among themselves, they're not going to be a threat to us. So, I don't see how our presence there is making a difference. It's like we're just trying to impose our will on them, but they're not receptive to it. Sometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they're waging war and causing destruction. I don't know, maybe that's just my perception, but it's hard for me to care about what's happening over there right now.\n\nI think we should have just left them alone and let them figure things out for themselves. War is a different beast for them than it is for us. We just can't compare the two. Our goal should have been to get out of there as soon as possible and not try to impose our values on them. We were just looking for revenge, and that's not a solid reason to go to war.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a clear plan. We didn't think about the long-term consequences of our actions, and now we're stuck in a situation that's not going to get better anytime soon. I think we should just cut our losses and get out of there. It's time for us to move on and let the Iraqis deal with their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church does need to adapt to some changes. They're losing followers, and I believe it's partly because they're not very open-minded about certain things. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which I think might be the problem. If they were to modernize their views a bit, I think they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard that people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of its stance on these issues. Some individuals are beginning to disagree with the Church's views, which is making them feel like the Church has the wrong perspective. The Church's stance on abortion, for example, might make it difficult for those who support it to feel comfortable following the Church's teachings.\n\nIt's also hard to understand why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think this would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing, but it's hard to say for sure. Perhaps if priests were allowed to be married, they might have made different choices, but it's hard to know for certain.\n\nOne thing that does make sense to me is that priests shouldn't be prevented from having a family life. Everyone else has a job and other loved ones, so why can't priests have both a career and a personal life? After all, the Church says priests are married to God, but that doesn't mean they can't have a personal life or devoted relationships with others.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it's wrong to hold them accountable for something they can't control.\n\nTo me, it doesn't seem like a choice, like someone could just decide to be straight or gay. People are either born straight or gay, and they shouldn't be judged for it. I mean, I was born straight, and I'm assuming other people are born the way they are too.\n\nI think it's unfair to make people feel like they've made a wrong choice just because of who they are. I don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue because it's not a matter of security or morality, it's just about people's personal lives. They shouldn't be telling people who they can or can't love.\n\nIt's not the government's place to interfere with people's relationships, especially when it comes to something as personal as their sexual orientation. I think it's just a matter of accepting people for who they are and not judging them.\n\nI'm not sure how to put it, but I think the government should stay out of it. It's not a security issue, it's not a moral issue, it's just about people living their lives. And I don't think they should be punished for being who they are.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but this is a misconception. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin - they're not the same, and it's unfair to treat them as such.\n\nOne of the main issues is that gay couples often don't have the same rights as straight couples. For example, if you're in a gay relationship and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you because they're not technically considered family. This seems pretty silly, especially if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nStudies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples, and they face the same challenges in their relationships. The main difference is that they're in love with someone of the same sex, but that doesn't make their relationship any less valid.\n\nThe thing is, gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church - they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. It's not about the church and state issue, it's about equal rights. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but equal is not the same thing. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships.\n\nPeople often worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are valid concerns. However, it's hard to say for sure how children of gay couples will adjust to society, especially in terms of their parents' sexual orientation. But this is a new area of study, and it's hard to make blanket statements.\n\nThe main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools. It's not about the parents' abilities, but about societal attitudes.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what's currently proposed. President Bush's views on gay marriage are likely influenced by his religious beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the country.\n\nLastly, it's ironic that some people are opposed to the idea of gay marriage while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of the country. It's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on the entire country, especially when it's not universally accepted. \n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and if people listened to research and studies instead of popular opinion, things might be different.",
            "Honestly, my job at the hospital pharmacy during the summer really opened my eyes to the benefits of certain substances. Just because something is considered taboo doesn't mean it's not helpful. I'm saying that if we're talking about making it available to the public, I'm definitely not in favor of that. But for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. The fact that a substance is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's not beneficial – it's all about perspective. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that we use all the time in pharmacies, like oxycontin and vicodin. They're controlled, but we still use them because they're helpful. So, why can't we do the same with marijuana, just because there's a stigma around it? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than dwelling on the negative. \n\nOne thing that bothers me is that people compare marijuana to alcohol, but it's not exactly the same. While abusing marijuana can have its downsides, so can abusing alcohol. It's a complex issue, and I don't think we should just outright ban it. Instead, I think we should take a step back and try to educate people about its benefits, and maybe even gradually introduce it in a controlled environment. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana, I think people will be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.\n\nIt's crazy how people's perception of marijuana is skewed because of its illegal status. They view it as this terrible substance, but it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's minds about marijuana, I think we'd see a more responsible approach to using it. And who knows, it could even be a game-changer for people in need of medical treatment.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, especially when it comes to its traditions and expectations. As someone who grew up attending church every Sunday, I can attest to this shift. I remember dressing up in cute outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse, every Sunday. It was a big part of my routine, especially since I attended a private school where I'd see my friends on weekends. The church even introduced a \"teenager mass\" that was significantly shorter, lasting only 30 minutes, and people started dressing more casually, even during summer when they'd come in straight from the beach. It's become a much more casual atmosphere, even during morning masses where I used to dress up. People now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from the more formal attire of my youth. This is probably the biggest thing I've noticed about the church.\n\nI don't think the church's stance on female priests or priests being allowed to marry would have prevented the allegations of pedophilia. There are still men who become pedophiles, even if they're married or part of other faiths that allow them to marry. It's not about the rules or restrictions, but about the individual's choices and desires. Plus, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and there are other religions that allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue to the Catholic Church. If someone wants to be a priest and be married, they might consider a different faith.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is more related to genetics than environmental factors. I don't think people just become pedophiles; they're born with these tendencies. While upbringing might play a small role, it's not the primary cause. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or other means. If the church knew about the allegations and tried to cover them up, that's a separate issue, but I don't think their stance on priests' marriages would have made a difference in preventing these cases.\n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any other thoughts to share on the matter.",
            "I was initially on board with the premise, but I think the world was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of events that led to the invasion, rather than a solid reason. The Bush administration linked the war in Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration just lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just a serious abuse of power in my opinion, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution since 9/11, and it seems like they always had plans to go to war.\n\nTo be honest, I think the younger Bush came into office with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and he was hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI do think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to problems since there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more deaths. The alternative of having the UN and the US work with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order doesn't seem like a good idea either. In the long run, it could create more problems because Iraq's sovereignty would be at issue, and it's clear that the interim government is faltering.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament isn't very effective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the government. Even the radical elements we were fighting last year, like Mugtada al-Sadr, now have a significant presence in the Parliament, causing more friction in the government.",
            "I'm not really sure about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's a pretty complex issue for me. I think a lot of people would agree that it's not really a declared war, but more of a retaliation against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and gain access to their oil resources. However, I'm not convinced this is a good reason to stay in Iraq, especially considering how it's causing so much tension and conflict. If we leave, Iraq will likely have to start from scratch, but if we stay, we'll be trying to impose our own democracy, which could take years and potentially make things worse. \n\nI'm not really sure what to think about this. I think it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families affected by it, but at the same time, I worry that our involvement is making things worse. It's a delicate balance between supporting the people of Iraq and respecting their culture, but also not trying to impose our own values on them. I fear that our interference could lead to more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida. I think this conflict will be ongoing for a long time, and it's hard to see a clear resolution.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as lawful. I believe it's up to the churches to decide this issue, given that the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This separation is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Making an amendment to restrict this would be contradictory to what's already been stated and written in the constitution.\n\nIn my opinion, even considering an amendment would be wrong, as it would be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't see why the government should be involved in this issue, except maybe because of the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. However, this is a clear example of the president showing preference for a particular religion over others.\n\nI think the churches should decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no real reason to support this amendment, other than personal views, and I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society. In any case, I've expressed my thoughts on this matter.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I think the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading Iraq, they linked the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government manipulated public emotions to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq war is a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways – the US government should've learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible. They removed the Iraqi government, but I don't think the US was prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The US was trying to establish a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they should've known it wouldn't be a smooth process.\n\nThe government should've planned for all possible outcomes, but it seems they weren't prepared for the long and difficult ordeal that ensued. Many American troops are still dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, which is a long and complex process. I think the US government made the American people believe it would be a short and successful engagement, but it's not that easy to establish a new form of government.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government made the decision to go to war in a way that was unrealistic and naive, considering the struggles we've faced in our own country to develop a democratic government. It's not something that can be done overnight, and it's not as easy as it seems. I think the government should've been more honest about the challenges they faced in Iraq.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you've been there for so long. We're the ones who removed their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them? But on the other hand, we can't keep risking American lives for an undetermined amount of time. The reason for invading Iraq was to establish a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? I think it's all about the oil issue and controlling resources. The fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, but we're not taking action against countries like North Korea, shows that the US government isn't being thorough or truthful in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, I don't think that's likely.",
            "Okay, so let's get this straight - I'm fully in support of gay marriage. I've always been, and I think it's essential that people are allowed to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives. With the growing amount of research showing that being gay could be determined by biology rather than social influences, it's hard to justify taking away people's rights based on something they can't control. \n\nTo me, it's inhumane to deny people the same rights as everyone else just because of their sexual orientation. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it's a personal matter that should be left out of politics. It's not about the state or the government; it's about individual freedom and the right to love who you want. \n\nTake my neighborhood back home for example - there are a few openly gay couples living there, but they're not married because they're not allowed to be. Despite that, they lead normal lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks and live their lives as they see fit. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush are trying to impose their own interpretation of marriage on everyone else. \n\nResearch has shown that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which can't be changed by upbringing or environment. It's not about how you're raised or your family dynamics; it's about who you are. \n\nOne of the main issues with gay marriage is that it's treated as a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it's front-page news. It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public debate and scrutiny. It's time for us to stop treating it like a national issue and let people make their own choices in peace.",
            "I don't know what to say, but when you put something online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've dealt with this issue before, and it's a big deal. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and if you're posting about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, people are going to take notice. Someone will inevitably say something or share it with someone who will act on it, and the school can't just ignore it because they might be able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough to know what to take seriously, though, because some people just joke around online. I've seen situations like the one at our school, where someone posted something that seemed like a joke but ended up being a serious issue. In this case, someone overheard someone making a comment at school, and it was reported. When we found out who the person was, their friends looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that could be misinterpreted. When you post things online, there's no private space; if you don't want people to see it, don't post it.\n\nYou can't control what people think, and you can't tell them what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media, but if something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's brought to their attention by someone you've given access to, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, I do think it's a bad idea for teachers to create fake social media accounts to monitor their students – that's not their place.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, so I wouldn't friend them on social media. If they post something online that I shouldn't see, I don't want to have to deal with it. That's not my responsibility, and it's not a connection I want to make.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, I believed that the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now just continuing the war for the sake of it, to prove our military strength. I'm not sure if the original motivations were even pure, considering George Bush's family history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn my opinion, if the goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason. But I think things have gotten off track. I believe we made our point in the first few months of the war, and starting it was a powerful statement in itself. However, continuing it for over a year or more just seems like a drawn-out ordeal.\n\nIf our purpose was to free a country from a tyrant's rule, I think that's a valid reason for war. But over time, it seems like our reasons have become distorted and misconceived. It's as if we're still fighting just to fight, and we want to avoid a decisive end or a victory. I genuinely think it's time to stop.\n\nWe've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be used to tackle our own issues like poverty and internal problems. Our economy is being drained for a cause that's no longer clear. War should not be a long-term part of our budget. We have pressing issues like public roads, schools, healthcare, and more that deserve funding.\n\nRight now, money is being spent on a war that's lost its purpose, and some of our citizens are sacrificing their lives. I think that's a tragic waste of resources.",
            "To clarify, I have a question. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, but I wanted to bring it up. Someone recently found out about a situation because they looked at someone's online profile on a site like Myspace. I think it's kind of a gray area, to be honest. If you post information online, it's pretty much available for anyone to see. On Myspace, for example, you have to add someone as a friend in order to see their profile, but by doing so, you're giving them permission to see your information. So, if someone looks at your profile, it's not really an invasion of privacy, per se.\n\nI mean, I think it's actually a good thing that they were able to see that information and potentially prevent a bad situation from happening. However, it raises some questions about whether it's right for someone to be constantly monitoring people's profiles to prevent something like that from happening. It's not feasible for one person to be watching everyone's profiles all the time, and it could lead to discrimination if they're only focusing on certain individuals.\n\nIt's a complicated issue, and I'm not really sure what the right answer is. I have a Facebook account, and it's a bit unsettling to know that there are people out there who can see information about me. I've heard stories about people getting information about others online and using it to contact them, which can be really creepy. It's hard to know who can see what, and it's a bit of a trade-off between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially after hearing about a guy on TV who was able to get a girl's screen name and contact information online and meet up with her in a short amount of time. It's a bit disturbing to think about how easy it is for people to get that kind of information. I've had people I don't know contact me on my Facebook and IM me, which can be a bit unnerving.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to stay in touch with my friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. My roommate was telling me about a situation at her high school where students were banned from having Myspace accounts, which I found a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or not, but it seems like the school shouldn't have had the authority to tell students what they can and can't do online.\n\nI'm not really sure what the solution is, but it's definitely something to think about.",
            "I'm a bit uncertain about what to say about the Iraq War, to be honest. I feel like I'm joining the bandwagon by criticizing it, and I don't want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start just to be vindicated later. However, it's not really a matter of being right or wrong anymore, but rather a general consensus that the war was a bad idea, apart from within the administration, which refuses to admit its mistakes. \n\nIf we look at polls conducted in the US, Iraq, and globally, we see that around 75-80% of the world's population believes the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view, and so do 70% of the US troops stationed there. It's clear that the war was a disaster from the start, and pulling out now won't be easy either. The situation is complex, and the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern states are too vast for administrations to understand.\n\nIt's ironic that the US thinks it can impose democracy on a region where it's not naturally accepted. The previous administration, and to some extent the current one, seems to think they can bring about change in a place that's not ready for it. I don't think anyone disputes Saddam's bad record, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. \n\nHonestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer. The administration might be coming up with hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons yet. If they want to withdraw gradually over several years, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't just leave now. According to statistics, 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do, and if we ask them, they'll make the decision for us. If things go wrong, we can say we were following their wishes.\n\nIn any case, if we decide to help after leaving, at least we'll be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the aggressors we are today.",
            "You know, I genuinely believe gender discrimination is still a widespread issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, but I think it's especially prevalent in certain professions. For instance, even though we're supposed to have equal opportunities, people often struggle to find a woman in a leadership position. This is largely due to the societal norms we've developed over time, where men are often expected to be in charge. As a result, women might have the qualifications for a particular job, but they may be overlooked for promotions simply because it's not customary for women to hold upper management positions. \n\nThe same issue applies to men in certain industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. It's still uncommon for men to stay at home and care for the kids, and society tends to view this as abnormal. People often assume that men should be the breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home may face criticism. It's hard for them because they might have always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives, and their partners might be the ones with better job prospects. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's also a problem with taking men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's because men who are into fashion often have different styles and preferences, and people might question their credibility in the field. They might think, \"If you're a man, how do I know you truly understand what women want in fashion?\" This can be a major obstacle for men in the industry.\n\nIt's tough to change these attitudes because societal norms are deeply ingrained, and we've made progress at a relatively slow pace. However, we're moving in the right direction. More women are taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs, which is helping to break down barriers. Similarly, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted as men realize that their partners might have better job prospects or a stronger work ethic.\n\nTo promote positive change, it's essential to showcase the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be too pushy or forceful, as this can lead to resistance. Instead, we should highlight their strengths and qualities, which can help shift people's perceptions. It's a delicate balance, but I think we're making progress, and change takes time.\n\nInterestingly, people from different backgrounds and with varying education levels can also face discrimination. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education might be overlooked for a CEO position because their grammar isn't perfect, even if they're extremely intelligent. Other men might look down on them, thinking, \"How can I trust you if you can't even put together a coherent sentence?\"\n\nSo, it's not just about gender; it's also about where you come from and how you communicate. It's a complex issue, and there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality.",
            "So, to clarify the current laws, they've decriminalized marijuana, which essentially downgrades the offense from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket. This means that you can get cited for it, but it won't lead to the same severe consequences as a full-blown drug charge. However, people still worry about the potential long-term effects on their future, as these won't necessarily disappear just because it's decriminalized.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that the costs associated with arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession can be quite high. It involves a lot of resources, including police time, court proceedings, and public defenders. In municipalities facing financial difficulties, some are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community needs.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal and open-minded place, seems to have found a balance that works for them. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've been able to allocate more resources towards public education, social programs, and other essential services. This approach seems to be a step in the right direction, as it acknowledges the financial and social aspects of the issue.\n\nOf course, there are valid concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use. If it were fully legalized, it could lead to increased usage, which might become a problem. However, it's also worth considering that marijuana's impact on people varies greatly, just like how individuals react to other substances. Some people can handle it responsibly, while others might struggle with its effects on their lifestyle.\n\nIn my opinion, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, but it's difficult to generalize how people will react. Ultimately, it's essential to acknowledge that individuals respond differently to substances, and we should focus on promoting responsible use and moderation.",
            "To be honest, I agree with the traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, as they have been doing things in the same way for a long time. On one hand, it's great to have roots in tradition, but on the other hand, it's essential to be open to change. I think a lot of Catholics believe they must attend church every week, and they're quite strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church judges those who don't strictly follow the doctrine and doesn't accept people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics.\n\nFor example, my parents, both of whom were Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their religions. This doesn't seem very tolerant, given the Catholic teaching of loving others. It's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. In my opinion, the Catholic Church's teachings tell people to do certain things, but their practices contradict these teachings because they're outdated. They stick with these outdated practices despite this contradiction.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily be a good idea, but I don't think it would prevent them from engaging in pedophilic behavior either. Pedophiles would likely still act on their impulses regardless of their marital status. It's a different situation altogether – they would likely still act on their desires, whether or not they're married.\n\nIn my view, those who abuse children will do so regardless of their marital status. It's not about being married or not; it's about the nature of the relationship. I don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these situations from happening. They would likely continue to occur despite any changes to the marriage policy.",
            "Honestly, I'm still on the fence about this topic... I haven't made up my mind yet, and I'm not sure if either side has a strong argument. What I do know is that this issue is super tricky - we're talking about the separation of church and state, and defining marriage in a way that won't offend anyone. That's tough to do. I think that all civil unions should be recognized, but I'm not convinced that marriage should be defined by the government, especially when it's a sacrament for some people. If it's just a matter of two people getting together, then it should be treated as a civil union, without the government getting involved in the specifics. And as for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people, a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push for it to become federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That just seems ridiculous. It's not a big enough issue to warrant amending the constitution. It's pretty simple, really - we shouldn't amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage. No way.",
            "Honestly, growing up in a Christian household made me look at homosexuality as a bit of a gray area. On one hand, I have many gay friends, which has given me a deeper understanding of the issue. However, I still don't entirely agree with the lifestyle. That being said, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter that the federal government should decide on its own. Instead, it should be up to individual states to make their own decisions.\n\nI think this is where democracy comes into play, as many states have different political leanings. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, so if you live in one, you're already aware of the local stance. I don't think it's right to disagree with the decision if a state chooses to legalize gay marriage, given that you chose to live there. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so I believe it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered that point. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I don't think President Bush should have the authority to dictate how the entire country feels about gay marriage. I believe it's the individual states that should decide whether to legalize it or not. I don't agree with his decision to ban it nationwide.\n\nIt just seems to me that Bush doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each state should run itself. In a couple of years, he'll be out of office, and if a Democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to leave it up to each individual state, as they'll be the ones living with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't agree.",
            "To be honest, I don't really get it, but let me break it down for you. Myspace is a public platform, right? It's like a bulletin board where you share your thoughts and experiences with others. If you post something on Myspace, you have to consider that others, including school officials, might see it. They might not even be looking for it under the school's name, but they could easily access it from their homes.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent school shootings or other potential threats, I think that's okay. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking online, I'm all for it. I mean, if they're just looking for students who are breaking the rules, like drinking or smoking, that's a different story. I think that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it to prevent harm, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nI know it's easy to express yourself more freely when you're writing, but when you're speaking, it's a different story. People often post things on Myspace without thinking about the consequences, and it can come back to haunt them. If you say something bad about someone in an email or post it online, it can be hard to take it back. It's like everything you do online is permanent, and you have to be careful what you say.\n\nIf a school shooting happens, it's not just about the students, it's about the entire school system. The officials are trying to ensure that the school is a safe place for everyone, and if that means monitoring online, I think that's okay. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done to keep people safe. I've had conversations with teachers about this, and they do regular lock-down drills and stuff to prepare for emergencies. It's not just about the school shooting, it's about being prepared for any situation.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online, I don't see a problem with it. They were just trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. That's all I've been trying to say.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation. At first, I was all for the decision to go to war, mainly because it was a personal issue for me following 9/11. I felt a strong desire to take action and make a difference, even if it meant causing some chaos in the process. However, looking back, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences. We just kind of rushed in without a clear plan, and it backfired on us.\n\nNow, I'm not just against the war; I think it actually did more harm than good. I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on working with us. It's like they're stuck in a never-ending cycle of conflict, and our presence isn't doing anything to change that. I've kind of lost interest in what's going on over there because of the way things have played out.\n\nSometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they conduct themselves in war. It's like they're more savage than civilized, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out. I think we should have left them to their own devices a long time ago.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war on a whim, driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, rather than a clear plan. The President might have thought he was doing the right thing, but looking back, I'm not so sure. We couldn't just let the situation go, but we could have handled it better. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and it showed. The lack of unity and a clear plan made things much harder for us.\n\nI don't think we're the right people to change those countries. They've been like that for a long time, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. In the end, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying; it's only a matter of time before things collapse once we leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church does need to adapt to some changes. They're losing followers, and I believe it's partly because they're not very open-minded about certain things. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which I think might be the problem. If they were to modernize their views a bit, I think they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard that people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of its stance on these issues. Some individuals are beginning to disagree with the Church's views, which is making them feel like the Church has the wrong perspective. The Church's stance on abortion, for example, might make it difficult for those who support it to feel comfortable following the Church's teachings.\n\nIt's also hard to understand why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think this would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing, but it's hard to say for sure. Perhaps if priests were allowed to be married, they might have made different choices, but it's hard to know for certain.\n\nOne thing that does make sense to me is that priests shouldn't be prevented from having a family life. Everyone else has a job and other loved ones, so why can't priests have both a career and a personal life? After all, the Church says priests are married to God, but that doesn't mean they can't have a personal life or devoted relationships with others.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it's wrong to hold them accountable for something they can't control.\n\nTo me, it doesn't seem like a choice, like someone could just decide to be straight or gay. People are either born straight or gay, and they shouldn't be judged for it. I mean, I was born straight, and I'm assuming other people are born the way they are too.\n\nI think it's unfair to make people feel like they've made a wrong choice just because of who they are. I don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue because it's not a matter of security or morality, it's just about people's personal lives. They shouldn't be telling people who they can or can't love.\n\nIt's not the government's place to interfere with people's relationships, especially when it comes to something as personal as their sexual orientation. I think it's just a matter of accepting people for who they are and not judging them.\n\nI'm not sure how to put it, but I think the government should stay out of it. It's not a security issue, it's not a moral issue, it's just about people living their lives. And I don't think they should be punished for being who they are.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but this is a misconception. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin - they're not the same, and it's unfair to treat them as such.\n\nOne of the main issues is that gay couples often don't have the same rights as straight couples. For example, if you're in a gay relationship and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you because they're not technically considered family. This seems pretty silly, especially if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nStudies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples, and they face the same challenges in their relationships. The main difference is that they're in love with someone of the same sex, but that doesn't make their relationship any less valid.\n\nThe thing is, gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church - they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. It's not about the church and state issue, it's about equal rights. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but equal is not the same thing. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships.\n\nPeople often worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are valid concerns. However, it's hard to say for sure how children of gay couples will adjust to society, especially in terms of their parents' sexual orientation. But this is a new area of study, and it's hard to make blanket statements.\n\nThe main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools. It's not about the parents' abilities, but about societal attitudes.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what's currently proposed. President Bush's views on gay marriage are likely influenced by his religious beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the country.\n\nLastly, it's ironic that some people are opposed to the idea of gay marriage while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of the country. It's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on the entire country, especially when it's not universally accepted. \n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and if people listened to research and studies instead of popular opinion, things might be different.",
            "Honestly, my job at the hospital pharmacy during the summer really opened my eyes to the benefits of certain substances. Just because something is considered taboo doesn't mean it's not helpful. I'm saying that if we're talking about making it available to the public, I'm definitely not in favor of that. But for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. The fact that a substance is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's not beneficial – it's all about perspective. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that we use all the time in pharmacies, like oxycontin and vicodin. They're controlled, but we still use them because they're helpful. So, why can't we do the same with marijuana, just because there's a stigma around it? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than dwelling on the negative. \n\nOne thing that bothers me is that people compare marijuana to alcohol, but it's not exactly the same. While abusing marijuana can have its downsides, so can abusing alcohol. It's a complex issue, and I don't think we should just outright ban it. Instead, I think we should take a step back and try to educate people about its benefits, and maybe even gradually introduce it in a controlled environment. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana, I think people will be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.\n\nIt's crazy how people's perception of marijuana is skewed because of its illegal status. They view it as this terrible substance, but it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's minds about marijuana, I think we'd see a more responsible approach to using it. And who knows, it could even be a game-changer for people in need of medical treatment.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, especially when it comes to its traditions and expectations. As someone who grew up attending church every Sunday, I can attest to this shift. I remember dressing up in cute outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse, every Sunday. It was a big part of my routine, especially since I attended a private school where I'd see my friends on weekends. The church even introduced a \"teenager mass\" that was significantly shorter, lasting only 30 minutes, and people started dressing more casually, even during summer when they'd come in straight from the beach. It's become a much more casual atmosphere, even during morning masses where I used to dress up. People now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from the more formal attire of my youth. This is probably the biggest thing I've noticed about the church.\n\nI don't think the church's stance on female priests or priests being allowed to marry would have prevented the allegations of pedophilia. There are still men who become pedophiles, even if they're married or part of other faiths that allow them to marry. It's not about the rules or restrictions, but about the individual's choices and desires. Plus, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and there are other religions that allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue to the Catholic Church. If someone wants to be a priest and be married, they might consider a different faith.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is more related to genetics than environmental factors. I don't think people just become pedophiles; they're born with these tendencies. While upbringing might play a small role, it's not the primary cause. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or other means. If the church knew about the allegations and tried to cover them up, that's a separate issue, but I don't think their stance on priests' marriages would have made a difference in preventing these cases.\n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any other thoughts to share on the matter.",
            "I was initially on board with the premise, but I think the world was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of events that led to the invasion, rather than a solid reason. The Bush administration linked the war in Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration just lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just a serious abuse of power in my opinion, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution since 9/11, and it seems like they always had plans to go to war.\n\nTo be honest, I think the younger Bush came into office with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and he was hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI do think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to problems since there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more deaths. The alternative of having the UN and the US work with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order doesn't seem like a good idea either. In the long run, it could create more problems because Iraq's sovereignty would be at issue, and it's clear that the interim government is faltering.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament isn't very effective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the government. Even the radical elements we were fighting last year, like Mugtada al-Sadr, now have a significant presence in the Parliament, causing more friction in the government.",
            "I'm not really sure about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's a pretty complex issue for me. I think a lot of people would agree that it's not really a declared war, but more of a retaliation against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and gain access to their oil resources. However, I'm not convinced this is a good reason to stay in Iraq, especially considering how it's causing so much tension and conflict. If we leave, Iraq will likely have to start from scratch, but if we stay, we'll be trying to impose our own democracy, which could take years and potentially make things worse. \n\nI'm not really sure what to think about this. I think it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families affected by it, but at the same time, I worry that our involvement is making things worse. It's a delicate balance between supporting the people of Iraq and respecting their culture, but also not trying to impose our own values on them. I fear that our interference could lead to more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida. I think this conflict will be ongoing for a long time, and it's hard to see a clear resolution.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as lawful. I believe it's up to the churches to decide this issue, given that the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This separation is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Making an amendment to restrict this would be contradictory to what's already been stated and written in the constitution.\n\nIn my opinion, even considering an amendment would be wrong, as it would be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't see why the government should be involved in this issue, except maybe because of the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. However, this is a clear example of the president showing preference for a particular religion over others.\n\nI think the churches should decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no real reason to support this amendment, other than personal views, and I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society. In any case, I've expressed my thoughts on this matter.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I think the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading Iraq, they linked the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government manipulated public emotions to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq war is a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways – the US government should've learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible. They removed the Iraqi government, but I don't think the US was prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The US was trying to establish a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they should've known it wouldn't be a smooth process.\n\nThe government should've planned for all possible outcomes, but it seems they weren't prepared for the long and difficult ordeal that ensued. Many American troops are still dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, which is a long and complex process. I think the US government made the American people believe it would be a short and successful engagement, but it's not that easy to establish a new form of government.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government made the decision to go to war in a way that was unrealistic and naive, considering the struggles we've faced in our own country to develop a democratic government. It's not something that can be done overnight, and it's not as easy as it seems. I think the government should've been more honest about the challenges they faced in Iraq.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you've been there for so long. We're the ones who removed their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them? But on the other hand, we can't keep risking American lives for an undetermined amount of time. The reason for invading Iraq was to establish a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? I think it's all about the oil issue and controlling resources. The fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, but we're not taking action against countries like North Korea, shows that the US government isn't being thorough or truthful in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, I don't think that's likely.",
            "Okay, so let's get this straight - I'm fully in support of gay marriage. I've always been, and I think it's essential that people are allowed to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives. With the growing amount of research showing that being gay could be determined by biology rather than social influences, it's hard to justify taking away people's rights based on something they can't control. \n\nTo me, it's inhumane to deny people the same rights as everyone else just because of their sexual orientation. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it's a personal matter that should be left out of politics. It's not about the state or the government; it's about individual freedom and the right to love who you want. \n\nTake my neighborhood back home for example - there are a few openly gay couples living there, but they're not married because they're not allowed to be. Despite that, they lead normal lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks and live their lives as they see fit. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush are trying to impose their own interpretation of marriage on everyone else. \n\nResearch has shown that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which can't be changed by upbringing or environment. It's not about how you're raised or your family dynamics; it's about who you are. \n\nOne of the main issues with gay marriage is that it's treated as a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it's front-page news. It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public debate and scrutiny. It's time for us to stop treating it like a national issue and let people make their own choices in peace.",
            "I don't know what to say, but when you put something online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've dealt with this issue before, and it's a big deal. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and if you're posting about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, people are going to take notice. Someone will inevitably say something or share it with someone who will act on it, and the school can't just ignore it because they might be able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough to know what to take seriously, though, because some people just joke around online. I've seen situations like the one at our school, where someone posted something that seemed like a joke but ended up being a serious issue. In this case, someone overheard someone making a comment at school, and it was reported. When we found out who the person was, their friends looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that could be misinterpreted. When you post things online, there's no private space; if you don't want people to see it, don't post it.\n\nYou can't control what people think, and you can't tell them what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media, but if something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's brought to their attention by someone you've given access to, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, I do think it's a bad idea for teachers to create fake social media accounts to monitor their students – that's not their place.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, so I wouldn't friend them on social media. If they post something online that I shouldn't see, I don't want to have to deal with it. That's not my responsibility, and it's not a connection I want to make.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, I believed that the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now just continuing the war for the sake of it, to prove our military strength. I'm not sure if the original motivations were even pure, considering George Bush's family history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn my opinion, if the goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason. But I think things have gotten off track. I believe we made our point in the first few months of the war, and starting it was a powerful statement in itself. However, continuing it for over a year or more just seems like a drawn-out ordeal.\n\nIf our purpose was to free a country from a tyrant's rule, I think that's a valid reason for war. But over time, it seems like our reasons have become distorted and misconceived. It's as if we're still fighting just to fight, and we want to avoid a decisive end or a victory. I genuinely think it's time to stop.\n\nWe've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be used to tackle our own issues like poverty and internal problems. Our economy is being drained for a cause that's no longer clear. War should not be a long-term part of our budget. We have pressing issues like public roads, schools, healthcare, and more that deserve funding.\n\nRight now, money is being spent on a war that's lost its purpose, and some of our citizens are sacrificing their lives. I think that's a tragic waste of resources.",
            "To clarify, I have a question. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, but I wanted to bring it up. Someone recently found out about a situation because they looked at someone's online profile on a site like Myspace. I think it's kind of a gray area, to be honest. If you post information online, it's pretty much available for anyone to see. On Myspace, for example, you have to add someone as a friend in order to see their profile, but by doing so, you're giving them permission to see your information. So, if someone looks at your profile, it's not really an invasion of privacy, per se.\n\nI mean, I think it's actually a good thing that they were able to see that information and potentially prevent a bad situation from happening. However, it raises some questions about whether it's right for someone to be constantly monitoring people's profiles to prevent something like that from happening. It's not feasible for one person to be watching everyone's profiles all the time, and it could lead to discrimination if they're only focusing on certain individuals.\n\nIt's a complicated issue, and I'm not really sure what the right answer is. I have a Facebook account, and it's a bit unsettling to know that there are people out there who can see information about me. I've heard stories about people getting information about others online and using it to contact them, which can be really creepy. It's hard to know who can see what, and it's a bit of a trade-off between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially after hearing about a guy on TV who was able to get a girl's screen name and contact information online and meet up with her in a short amount of time. It's a bit disturbing to think about how easy it is for people to get that kind of information. I've had people I don't know contact me on my Facebook and IM me, which can be a bit unnerving.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to stay in touch with my friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. My roommate was telling me about a situation at her high school where students were banned from having Myspace accounts, which I found a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or not, but it seems like the school shouldn't have had the authority to tell students what they can and can't do online.\n\nI'm not really sure what the solution is, but it's definitely something to think about.",
            "I'm a bit uncertain about what to say about the Iraq War, to be honest. I feel like I'm joining the bandwagon by criticizing it, and I don't want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start just to be vindicated later. However, it's not really a matter of being right or wrong anymore, but rather a general consensus that the war was a bad idea, apart from within the administration, which refuses to admit its mistakes. \n\nIf we look at polls conducted in the US, Iraq, and globally, we see that around 75-80% of the world's population believes the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view, and so do 70% of the US troops stationed there. It's clear that the war was a disaster from the start, and pulling out now won't be easy either. The situation is complex, and the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern states are too vast for administrations to understand.\n\nIt's ironic that the US thinks it can impose democracy on a region where it's not naturally accepted. The previous administration, and to some extent the current one, seems to think they can bring about change in a place that's not ready for it. I don't think anyone disputes Saddam's bad record, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. \n\nHonestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer. The administration might be coming up with hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons yet. If they want to withdraw gradually over several years, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't just leave now. According to statistics, 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do, and if we ask them, they'll make the decision for us. If things go wrong, we can say we were following their wishes.\n\nIn any case, if we decide to help after leaving, at least we'll be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the aggressors we are today.",
            "You know, I genuinely believe gender discrimination is still a widespread issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, but I think it's especially prevalent in certain professions. For instance, even though we're supposed to have equal opportunities, people often struggle to find a woman in a leadership position. This is largely due to the societal norms we've developed over time, where men are often expected to be in charge. As a result, women might have the qualifications for a particular job, but they may be overlooked for promotions simply because it's not customary for women to hold upper management positions. \n\nThe same issue applies to men in certain industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. It's still uncommon for men to stay at home and care for the kids, and society tends to view this as abnormal. People often assume that men should be the breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home may face criticism. It's hard for them because they might have always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives, and their partners might be the ones with better job prospects. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's also a problem with taking men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's because men who are into fashion often have different styles and preferences, and people might question their credibility in the field. They might think, \"If you're a man, how do I know you truly understand what women want in fashion?\" This can be a major obstacle for men in the industry.\n\nIt's tough to change these attitudes because societal norms are deeply ingrained, and we've made progress at a relatively slow pace. However, we're moving in the right direction. More women are taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs, which is helping to break down barriers. Similarly, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted as men realize that their partners might have better job prospects or a stronger work ethic.\n\nTo promote positive change, it's essential to showcase the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be too pushy or forceful, as this can lead to resistance. Instead, we should highlight their strengths and qualities, which can help shift people's perceptions. It's a delicate balance, but I think we're making progress, and change takes time.\n\nInterestingly, people from different backgrounds and with varying education levels can also face discrimination. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education might be overlooked for a CEO position because their grammar isn't perfect, even if they're extremely intelligent. Other men might look down on them, thinking, \"How can I trust you if you can't even put together a coherent sentence?\"\n\nSo, it's not just about gender; it's also about where you come from and how you communicate. It's a complex issue, and there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality.",
            "So, to clarify the current laws, they've decriminalized marijuana, which essentially downgrades the offense from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket. This means that you can get cited for it, but it won't lead to the same severe consequences as a full-blown drug charge. However, people still worry about the potential long-term effects on their future, as these won't necessarily disappear just because it's decriminalized.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that the costs associated with arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession can be quite high. It involves a lot of resources, including police time, court proceedings, and public defenders. In municipalities facing financial difficulties, some are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community needs.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal and open-minded place, seems to have found a balance that works for them. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've been able to allocate more resources towards public education, social programs, and other essential services. This approach seems to be a step in the right direction, as it acknowledges the financial and social aspects of the issue.\n\nOf course, there are valid concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use. If it were fully legalized, it could lead to increased usage, which might become a problem. However, it's also worth considering that marijuana's impact on people varies greatly, just like how individuals react to other substances. Some people can handle it responsibly, while others might struggle with its effects on their lifestyle.\n\nIn my opinion, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, but it's difficult to generalize how people will react. Ultimately, it's essential to acknowledge that individuals respond differently to substances, and we should focus on promoting responsible use and moderation.",
            "To be honest, I agree with the traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, as they have been doing things in the same way for a long time. On one hand, it's great to have roots in tradition, but on the other hand, it's essential to be open to change. I think a lot of Catholics believe they must attend church every week, and they're quite strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church judges those who don't strictly follow the doctrine and doesn't accept people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics.\n\nFor example, my parents, both of whom were Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their religions. This doesn't seem very tolerant, given the Catholic teaching of loving others. It's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. In my opinion, the Catholic Church's teachings tell people to do certain things, but their practices contradict these teachings because they're outdated. They stick with these outdated practices despite this contradiction.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily be a good idea, but I don't think it would prevent them from engaging in pedophilic behavior either. Pedophiles would likely still act on their impulses regardless of their marital status. It's a different situation altogether – they would likely still act on their desires, whether or not they're married.\n\nIn my view, those who abuse children will do so regardless of their marital status. It's not about being married or not; it's about the nature of the relationship. I don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these situations from happening. They would likely continue to occur despite any changes to the marriage policy.",
            "Honestly, I'm still on the fence about this topic... I haven't made up my mind yet, and I'm not sure if either side has a strong argument. What I do know is that this issue is super tricky - we're talking about the separation of church and state, and defining marriage in a way that won't offend anyone. That's tough to do. I think that all civil unions should be recognized, but I'm not convinced that marriage should be defined by the government, especially when it's a sacrament for some people. If it's just a matter of two people getting together, then it should be treated as a civil union, without the government getting involved in the specifics. And as for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people, a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push for it to become federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That just seems ridiculous. It's not a big enough issue to warrant amending the constitution. It's pretty simple, really - we shouldn't amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage. No way.",
            "Honestly, growing up in a Christian household made me look at homosexuality as a bit of a gray area. On one hand, I have many gay friends, which has given me a deeper understanding of the issue. However, I still don't entirely agree with the lifestyle. That being said, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter that the federal government should decide on its own. Instead, it should be up to individual states to make their own decisions.\n\nI think this is where democracy comes into play, as many states have different political leanings. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, so if you live in one, you're already aware of the local stance. I don't think it's right to disagree with the decision if a state chooses to legalize gay marriage, given that you chose to live there. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so I believe it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered that point. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I don't think President Bush should have the authority to dictate how the entire country feels about gay marriage. I believe it's the individual states that should decide whether to legalize it or not. I don't agree with his decision to ban it nationwide.\n\nIt just seems to me that Bush doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each state should run itself. In a couple of years, he'll be out of office, and if a Democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to leave it up to each individual state, as they'll be the ones living with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't agree.",
            "To be honest, I don't really get it, but let me break it down for you. Myspace is a public platform, right? It's like a bulletin board where you share your thoughts and experiences with others. If you post something on Myspace, you have to consider that others, including school officials, might see it. They might not even be looking for it under the school's name, but they could easily access it from their homes.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent school shootings or other potential threats, I think that's okay. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking online, I'm all for it. I mean, if they're just looking for students who are breaking the rules, like drinking or smoking, that's a different story. I think that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it to prevent harm, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nI know it's easy to express yourself more freely when you're writing, but when you're speaking, it's a different story. People often post things on Myspace without thinking about the consequences, and it can come back to haunt them. If you say something bad about someone in an email or post it online, it can be hard to take it back. It's like everything you do online is permanent, and you have to be careful what you say.\n\nIf a school shooting happens, it's not just about the students, it's about the entire school system. The officials are trying to ensure that the school is a safe place for everyone, and if that means monitoring online, I think that's okay. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done to keep people safe. I've had conversations with teachers about this, and they do regular lock-down drills and stuff to prepare for emergencies. It's not just about the school shooting, it's about being prepared for any situation.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online, I don't see a problem with it. They were just trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. That's all I've been trying to say.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation. At first, I was all for the decision to go to war, mainly because it was a personal issue for me following 9/11. I felt a strong desire to take action and make a difference, even if it meant causing some chaos in the process. However, looking back, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences. We just kind of rushed in without a clear plan, and it backfired on us.\n\nNow, I'm not just against the war; I think it actually did more harm than good. I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on working with us. It's like they're stuck in a never-ending cycle of conflict, and our presence isn't doing anything to change that. I've kind of lost interest in what's going on over there because of the way things have played out.\n\nSometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they conduct themselves in war. It's like they're more savage than civilized, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out. I think we should have left them to their own devices a long time ago.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war on a whim, driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, rather than a clear plan. The President might have thought he was doing the right thing, but looking back, I'm not so sure. We couldn't just let the situation go, but we could have handled it better. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and it showed. The lack of unity and a clear plan made things much harder for us.\n\nI don't think we're the right people to change those countries. They've been like that for a long time, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. In the end, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying; it's only a matter of time before things collapse once we leave."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church does need to adapt to some changes. They're losing followers, and I believe it's partly because they're not very open-minded about certain things. For instance, their views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite traditional, which I think might be the problem. If they were to modernize their views a bit, I think they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard that people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of its stance on these issues. Some individuals are beginning to disagree with the Church's views, which is making them feel like the Church has the wrong perspective. The Church's stance on abortion, for example, might make it difficult for those who support it to feel comfortable following the Church's teachings.\n\nIt's also hard to understand why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't think this would necessarily have prevented the issues they're facing, but it's hard to say for sure. Perhaps if priests were allowed to be married, they might have made different choices, but it's hard to know for certain.\n\nOne thing that does make sense to me is that priests shouldn't be prevented from having a family life. Everyone else has a job and other loved ones, so why can't priests have both a career and a personal life? After all, the Church says priests are married to God, but that doesn't mean they can't have a personal life or devoted relationships with others.",
            "Honestly, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, it's just who they are. I think it's wrong to hold them accountable for something they can't control.\n\nTo me, it doesn't seem like a choice, like someone could just decide to be straight or gay. People are either born straight or gay, and they shouldn't be judged for it. I mean, I was born straight, and I'm assuming other people are born the way they are too.\n\nI think it's unfair to make people feel like they've made a wrong choice just because of who they are. I don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue because it's not a matter of security or morality, it's just about people's personal lives. They shouldn't be telling people who they can or can't love.\n\nIt's not the government's place to interfere with people's relationships, especially when it comes to something as personal as their sexual orientation. I think it's just a matter of accepting people for who they are and not judging them.\n\nI'm not sure how to put it, but I think the government should stay out of it. It's not a security issue, it's not a moral issue, it's just about people living their lives. And I don't think they should be punished for being who they are.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no good reason not to. People often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but this is a misconception. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin - they're not the same, and it's unfair to treat them as such.\n\nOne of the main issues is that gay couples often don't have the same rights as straight couples. For example, if you're in a gay relationship and you're sick, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you because they're not technically considered family. This seems pretty silly, especially if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone.\n\nStudies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of success and satisfaction as straight couples, and they face the same challenges in their relationships. The main difference is that they're in love with someone of the same sex, but that doesn't make their relationship any less valid.\n\nThe thing is, gay couples aren't asking to get married in a church - they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. It's not about the church and state issue, it's about equal rights. If a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but equal is not the same thing. Gay couples are the same in many ways, with the same roles and responsibilities in their relationships.\n\nPeople often worry about adoption issues and community impact, but these are valid concerns. However, it's hard to say for sure how children of gay couples will adjust to society, especially in terms of their parents' sexual orientation. But this is a new area of study, and it's hard to make blanket statements.\n\nThe main issue is how children are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, there are even special schools for children of gay parents because they face bullying and harassment in public schools. It's not about the parents' abilities, but about societal attitudes.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment should be the opposite of what's currently proposed. President Bush's views on gay marriage are likely influenced by his religious beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the country.\n\nLastly, it's ironic that some people are opposed to the idea of gay marriage while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of the country. It's hypocritical to enforce religious standards on the entire country, especially when it's not universally accepted. \n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and if people listened to research and studies instead of popular opinion, things might be different.",
            "Honestly, my job at the hospital pharmacy during the summer really opened my eyes to the benefits of certain substances. Just because something is considered taboo doesn't mean it's not helpful. I'm saying that if we're talking about making it available to the public, I'm definitely not in favor of that. But for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story. The fact that a substance is illegal doesn't automatically mean it's not beneficial – it's all about perspective. \n\nThink about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that we use all the time in pharmacies, like oxycontin and vicodin. They're controlled, but we still use them because they're helpful. So, why can't we do the same with marijuana, just because there's a stigma around it? I think we should focus on its benefits rather than dwelling on the negative. \n\nOne thing that bothers me is that people compare marijuana to alcohol, but it's not exactly the same. While abusing marijuana can have its downsides, so can abusing alcohol. It's a complex issue, and I don't think we should just outright ban it. Instead, I think we should take a step back and try to educate people about its benefits, and maybe even gradually introduce it in a controlled environment. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana, I think people will be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.\n\nIt's crazy how people's perception of marijuana is skewed because of its illegal status. They view it as this terrible substance, but it's not as bad as some other things out there, like heroin or cocaine. If we could change people's minds about marijuana, I think we'd see a more responsible approach to using it. And who knows, it could even be a game-changer for people in need of medical treatment.",
            "I think the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be, especially when it comes to its traditions and expectations. As someone who grew up attending church every Sunday, I can attest to this shift. I remember dressing up in cute outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse, every Sunday. It was a big part of my routine, especially since I attended a private school where I'd see my friends on weekends. The church even introduced a \"teenager mass\" that was significantly shorter, lasting only 30 minutes, and people started dressing more casually, even during summer when they'd come in straight from the beach. It's become a much more casual atmosphere, even during morning masses where I used to dress up. People now wear jeans and khakis, which is a big change from the more formal attire of my youth. This is probably the biggest thing I've noticed about the church.\n\nI don't think the church's stance on female priests or priests being allowed to marry would have prevented the allegations of pedophilia. There are still men who become pedophiles, even if they're married or part of other faiths that allow them to marry. It's not about the rules or restrictions, but about the individual's choices and desires. Plus, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and there are other religions that allow their clergy to be married, so it's not like it's a unique issue to the Catholic Church. If someone wants to be a priest and be married, they might consider a different faith.\n\nTo be honest, I think pedophilia is more related to genetics than environmental factors. I don't think people just become pedophiles; they're born with these tendencies. While upbringing might play a small role, it's not the primary cause. You can't hide someone's true nature through marriage or other means. If the church knew about the allegations and tried to cover them up, that's a separate issue, but I don't think their stance on priests' marriages would have made a difference in preventing these cases.\n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any other thoughts to share on the matter.",
            "I was initially on board with the premise, but I think the world was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It seemed like we invaded Iraq as a result of a series of events that led to the invasion, rather than a solid reason. The Bush administration linked the war in Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really didn't sit well with me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration just lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's just a serious abuse of power in my opinion, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the people like that. The Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the constitution since 9/11, and it seems like they always had plans to go to war.\n\nTo be honest, I think the younger Bush came into office with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and he was hoping to expand our energy supply. That's a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI do think it's gone on long enough, but withdrawing now could lead to problems since there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war, resulting in even more deaths. The alternative of having the UN and the US work with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order doesn't seem like a good idea either. In the long run, it could create more problems because Iraq's sovereignty would be at issue, and it's clear that the interim government is faltering.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament isn't very effective, and the Prime Minister has little control over the government. Even the radical elements we were fighting last year, like Mugtada al-Sadr, now have a significant presence in the Parliament, causing more friction in the government.",
            "I'm not really sure about the War in Iraq. To be honest, it's a pretty complex issue for me. I think a lot of people would agree that it's not really a declared war, but more of a retaliation against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not really up-to-date on the details, but it seems like our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and gain access to their oil resources. However, I'm not convinced this is a good reason to stay in Iraq, especially considering how it's causing so much tension and conflict. If we leave, Iraq will likely have to start from scratch, but if we stay, we'll be trying to impose our own democracy, which could take years and potentially make things worse. \n\nI'm not really sure what to think about this. I think it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there are so many families affected by it, but at the same time, I worry that our involvement is making things worse. It's a delicate balance between supporting the people of Iraq and respecting their culture, but also not trying to impose our own values on them. I fear that our interference could lead to more hatred towards the US and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Kaida. I think this conflict will be ongoing for a long time, and it's hard to see a clear resolution.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for the government to make it legal or for a state to declare it as lawful. I believe it's up to the churches to decide this issue, given that the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. This separation is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Making an amendment to restrict this would be contradictory to what's already been stated and written in the constitution.\n\nIn my opinion, even considering an amendment would be wrong, as it would be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't see why the government should be involved in this issue, except maybe because of the president's personal beliefs as a Catholic. However, this is a clear example of the president showing preference for a particular religion over others.\n\nI think the churches should decide this matter, not the president or any government official. There's no real reason to support this amendment, other than personal views, and I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society. In any case, I've expressed my thoughts on this matter.",
            "Okay, so the war in Iraq... I think the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about why they wanted to go to war. Before invading Iraq, they linked the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government manipulated public emotions to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The Iraq war is a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways – the US government should've learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and it's just horrible. They removed the Iraqi government, but I don't think the US was prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed. The US was trying to establish a democratic government, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but they should've known it wouldn't be a smooth process.\n\nThe government should've planned for all possible outcomes, but it seems they weren't prepared for the long and difficult ordeal that ensued. Many American troops are still dying, and they're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces, which is a long and complex process. I think the US government made the American people believe it would be a short and successful engagement, but it's not that easy to establish a new form of government.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government made the decision to go to war in a way that was unrealistic and naive, considering the struggles we've faced in our own country to develop a democratic government. It's not something that can be done overnight, and it's not as easy as it seems. I think the government should've been more honest about the challenges they faced in Iraq.\n\nIt's a difficult decision to make, especially when you've been there for so long. We're the ones who removed their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them? But on the other hand, we can't keep risking American lives for an undetermined amount of time. The reason for invading Iraq was to establish a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? I think it's all about the oil issue and controlling resources. The fact that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, but we're not taking action against countries like North Korea, shows that the US government isn't being thorough or truthful in their decisions.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, I don't think that's likely.",

I've always been, and I think it's essential that people are allowed to make their own choices when it comes to their personal lives. With the growing amount of research showing that being gay could be determined by biology rather than social influences, it's hard to justify taking away people's rights based on something they can't control. \n\nTo me, it's inhumane to deny people the same rights as everyone else just because of their sexual orientation. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage, and I believe it's a personal matter that should be left out of politics. It's not about the state or the government; it's about individual freedom and the right to love who you want. \n\nTake my neighborhood back home for example - there are a few openly gay couples living there, but they're not married because they're not allowed to be. Despite that, they lead normal lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks and live their lives as they see fit. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush are trying to impose their own interpretation of marriage on everyone else. \n\nResearch has shown that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, which can't be changed by upbringing or environment. It's not about how you're raised or your family dynamics; it's about who you are. \n\nOne of the main issues with gay marriage is that it's treated as a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, but if two gay people want to tie the knot, it's front-page news. It should be a private, personal matter, not something that's subject to public debate and scrutiny. It's time for us to stop treating it like a national issue and let people make their own choices in peace.",
            "I don't know what to say, but when you put something online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. It's completely public, and you can't control who sees it. As an R.A., I've dealt with this issue before, and it's a big deal. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and if you're posting about sensitive topics like violence or shootings, people are going to take notice. Someone will inevitably say something or share it with someone who will act on it, and the school can't just ignore it because they might be able to prevent something bad from happening.\n\nIt's tough to know what to take seriously, though, because some people just joke around online. I've seen situations like the one at our school, where someone posted something that seemed like a joke but ended up being a serious issue. In this case, someone overheard someone making a comment at school, and it was reported. When we found out who the person was, their friends looked through their Facebook and found some stuff that could be misinterpreted. When you post things online, there's no private space; if you don't want people to see it, don't post it.\n\nYou can't control what people think, and you can't tell them what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media, but if something comes to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's brought to their attention by someone you've given access to, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, I do think it's a bad idea for teachers to create fake social media accounts to monitor their students – that's not their place.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I don't want to know about my residents' private lives, so I wouldn't friend them on social media. If they post something online that I shouldn't see, I don't want to have to deal with it. That's not my responsibility, and it's not a connection I want to make.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, I believed that the purpose was noble - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now just continuing the war for the sake of it, to prove our military strength. I'm not sure if the original motivations were even pure, considering George Bush's family history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn my opinion, if the goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a justifiable reason. But I think things have gotten off track. I believe we made our point in the first few months of the war, and starting it was a powerful statement in itself. However, continuing it for over a year or more just seems like a drawn-out ordeal.\n\nIf our purpose was to free a country from a tyrant's rule, I think that's a valid reason for war. But over time, it seems like our reasons have become distorted and misconceived. It's as if we're still fighting just to fight, and we want to avoid a decisive end or a victory. I genuinely think it's time to stop.\n\nWe've been pouring billions of dollars into this war, which could be used to tackle our own issues like poverty and internal problems. Our economy is being drained for a cause that's no longer clear. War should not be a long-term part of our budget. We have pressing issues like public roads, schools, healthcare, and more that deserve funding.\n\nRight now, money is being spent on a war that's lost its purpose, and some of our citizens are sacrificing their lives. I think that's a tragic waste of resources.",
            "To clarify, I have a question. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, but I wanted to bring it up. Someone recently found out about a situation because they looked at someone's online profile on a site like Myspace. I think it's kind of a gray area, to be honest. If you post information online, it's pretty much available for anyone to see. On Myspace, for example, you have to add someone as a friend in order to see their profile, but by doing so, you're giving them permission to see your information. So, if someone looks at your profile, it's not really an invasion of privacy, per se.\n\nI mean, I think it's actually a good thing that they were able to see that information and potentially prevent a bad situation from happening. However, it raises some questions about whether it's right for someone to be constantly monitoring people's profiles to prevent something like that from happening. It's not feasible for one person to be watching everyone's profiles all the time, and it could lead to discrimination if they're only focusing on certain individuals.\n\nIt's a complicated issue, and I'm not really sure what the right answer is. I have a Facebook account, and it's a bit unsettling to know that there are people out there who can see information about me. I've heard stories about people getting information about others online and using it to contact them, which can be really creepy. It's hard to know who can see what, and it's a bit of a trade-off between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially after hearing about a guy on TV who was able to get a girl's screen name and contact information online and meet up with her in a short amount of time. It's a bit disturbing to think about how easy it is for people to get that kind of information. I've had people I don't know contact me on my Facebook and IM me, which can be a bit unnerving.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to stay in touch with my friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. My roommate was telling me about a situation at her high school where students were banned from having Myspace accounts, which I found a bit strange. I'm not sure if that's a privacy issue or not, but it seems like the school shouldn't have had the authority to tell students what they can and can't do online.\n\nI'm not really sure what the solution is, but it's definitely something to think about.",
            "I'm a bit uncertain about what to say about the Iraq War, to be honest. I feel like I'm joining the bandwagon by criticizing it, and I don't want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start just to be vindicated later. However, it's not really a matter of being right or wrong anymore, but rather a general consensus that the war was a bad idea, apart from within the administration, which refuses to admit its mistakes. \n\nIf we look at polls conducted in the US, Iraq, and globally, we see that around 75-80% of the world's population believes the war was a bad idea. In Iraq, 80% of the population shares this view, and so do 70% of the US troops stationed there. It's clear that the war was a disaster from the start, and pulling out now won't be easy either. The situation is complex, and the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern states are too vast for administrations to understand.\n\nIt's ironic that the US thinks it can impose democracy on a region where it's not naturally accepted. The previous administration, and to some extent the current one, seems to think they can bring about change in a place that's not ready for it. I don't think anyone disputes Saddam's bad record, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. \n\nHonestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer. The administration might be coming up with hopeful ideas about why we should stay, but I haven't heard any legitimate reasons yet. If they want to withdraw gradually over several years, I wouldn't object, but I don't see why we can't just leave now. According to statistics, 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. It's ironic that we're trying to help them, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than we do, and if we ask them, they'll make the decision for us. If things go wrong, we can say we were following their wishes.\n\nIn any case, if we decide to help after leaving, at least we'll be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the aggressors we are today.",
            "You know, I genuinely believe gender discrimination is still a widespread issue in the United States. It's not just limited to women, but I think it's especially prevalent in certain professions. For instance, even though we're supposed to have equal opportunities, people often struggle to find a woman in a leadership position. This is largely due to the societal norms we've developed over time, where men are often expected to be in charge. As a result, women might have the qualifications for a particular job, but they may be overlooked for promotions simply because it's not customary for women to hold upper management positions. \n\nThe same issue applies to men in certain industries like fashion or stay-at-home parenting. It's still uncommon for men to stay at home and care for the kids, and society tends to view this as abnormal. People often assume that men should be the breadwinners, and those who choose to stay home may face criticism. It's hard for them because they might have always dreamed of being involved in their children's lives, and their partners might be the ones with better job prospects. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's also a problem with taking men seriously, especially if they're straight. It's because men who are into fashion often have different styles and preferences, and people might question their credibility in the field. They might think, \"If you're a man, how do I know you truly understand what women want in fashion?\" This can be a major obstacle for men in the industry.\n\nIt's tough to change these attitudes because societal norms are deeply ingrained, and we've made progress at a relatively slow pace. However, we're moving in the right direction. More women are taking on leadership roles and becoming CEOs, which is helping to break down barriers. Similarly, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted as men realize that their partners might have better job prospects or a stronger work ethic.\n\nTo promote positive change, it's essential to showcase the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be too pushy or forceful, as this can lead to resistance. Instead, we should highlight their strengths and qualities, which can help shift people's perceptions. It's a delicate balance, but I think we're making progress, and change takes time.\n\nInterestingly, people from different backgrounds and with varying education levels can also face discrimination. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education might be overlooked for a CEO position because their grammar isn't perfect, even if they're extremely intelligent. Other men might look down on them, thinking, \"How can I trust you if you can't even put together a coherent sentence?\"\n\nSo, it's not just about gender; it's also about where you come from and how you communicate. It's a complex issue, and there's still much work to be done to achieve true equality.",
            "So, to clarify the current laws, they've decriminalized marijuana, which essentially downgrades the offense from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket. This means that you can get cited for it, but it won't lead to the same severe consequences as a full-blown drug charge. However, people still worry about the potential long-term effects on their future, as these won't necessarily disappear just because it's decriminalized.\n\nOn the other hand, there's an argument that the costs associated with arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession can be quite high. It involves a lot of resources, including police time, court proceedings, and public defenders. In municipalities facing financial difficulties, some are hesitant to make this change, even if it could free up funds for more important community needs.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal and open-minded place, seems to have found a balance that works for them. By decriminalizing marijuana, they've been able to allocate more resources towards public education, social programs, and other essential services. This approach seems to be a step in the right direction, as it acknowledges the financial and social aspects of the issue.\n\nOf course, there are valid concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use. If it were fully legalized, it could lead to increased usage, which might become a problem. However, it's also worth considering that marijuana's impact on people varies greatly, just like how individuals react to other substances. Some people can handle it responsibly, while others might struggle with its effects on their lifestyle.\n\nIn my opinion, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, but it's difficult to generalize how people will react. Ultimately, it's essential to acknowledge that individuals respond differently to substances, and we should focus on promoting responsible use and moderation.",
            "To be honest, I agree with the traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, as they have been doing things in the same way for a long time. On one hand, it's great to have roots in tradition, but on the other hand, it's essential to be open to change. I think a lot of Catholics believe they must attend church every week, and they're quite strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church judges those who don't strictly follow the doctrine and doesn't accept people from other faiths or those who aren't perfect Catholics.\n\nFor example, my parents, both of whom were Episcopalian, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of their religions. This doesn't seem very tolerant, given the Catholic teaching of loving others. It's hypocritical to preach love and acceptance while not practicing it. In my opinion, the Catholic Church's teachings tell people to do certain things, but their practices contradict these teachings because they're outdated. They stick with these outdated practices despite this contradiction.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would necessarily be a good idea, but I don't think it would prevent them from engaging in pedophilic behavior either. Pedophiles would likely still act on their impulses regardless of their marital status. It's a different situation altogether – they would likely still act on their desires, whether or not they're married.\n\nIn my view, those who abuse children will do so regardless of their marital status. It's not about being married or not; it's about the nature of the relationship. I don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these situations from happening. They would likely continue to occur despite any changes to the marriage policy.",
            "Honestly, I'm still on the fence about this topic... I haven't made up my mind yet, and I'm not sure if either side has a strong argument. What I do know is that this issue is super tricky - we're talking about the separation of church and state, and defining marriage in a way that won't offend anyone. That's tough to do. I think that all civil unions should be recognized, but I'm not convinced that marriage should be defined by the government, especially when it's a sacrament for some people. If it's just a matter of two people getting together, then it should be treated as a civil union, without the government getting involved in the specifics. And as for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people, a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push for it to become federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That just seems ridiculous. It's not a big enough issue to warrant amending the constitution. It's pretty simple, really - we shouldn't amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage. No way.",
            "Honestly, growing up in a Christian household made me look at homosexuality as a bit of a gray area. On one hand, I have many gay friends, which has given me a deeper understanding of the issue. However, I still don't entirely agree with the lifestyle. That being said, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a matter that the federal government should decide on its own. Instead, it should be up to individual states to make their own decisions.\n\nI think this is where democracy comes into play, as many states have different political leanings. Democratic states are likely to support gay marriage, so if you live in one, you're already aware of the local stance. I don't think it's right to disagree with the decision if a state chooses to legalize gay marriage, given that you chose to live there. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so I believe it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered that point. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I don't think President Bush should have the authority to dictate how the entire country feels about gay marriage. I believe it's the individual states that should decide whether to legalize it or not. I don't agree with his decision to ban it nationwide.\n\nIt just seems to me that Bush doesn't live in every state, so he shouldn't get to decide how each state should run itself. In a couple of years, he'll be out of office, and if a Democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to leave it up to each individual state, as they'll be the ones living with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't agree.",
            "To be honest, I don't really get it, but let me break it down for you. Myspace is a public platform, right? It's like a bulletin board where you share your thoughts and experiences with others. If you post something on Myspace, you have to consider that others, including school officials, might see it. They might not even be looking for it under the school's name, but they could easily access it from their homes.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent school shootings or other potential threats, I think that's okay. It's their responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking online, I'm all for it. I mean, if they're just looking for students who are breaking the rules, like drinking or smoking, that's a different story. I think that's an invasion of privacy. But if they're doing it to prevent harm, I don't see it as an invasion.\n\nI know it's easy to express yourself more freely when you're writing, but when you're speaking, it's a different story. People often post things on Myspace without thinking about the consequences, and it can come back to haunt them. If you say something bad about someone in an email or post it online, it can be hard to take it back. It's like everything you do online is permanent, and you have to be careful what you say.\n\nIf a school shooting happens, it's not just about the students, it's about the entire school system. The officials are trying to ensure that the school is a safe place for everyone, and if that means monitoring online, I think that's okay. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done to keep people safe. I've had conversations with teachers about this, and they do regular lock-down drills and stuff to prepare for emergencies. It's not just about the school shooting, it's about being prepared for any situation.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place, and if that means monitoring online, I don't see a problem with it. They were just trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. That's all I've been trying to say.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation. At first, I was all for the decision to go to war, mainly because it was a personal issue for me following 9/11. I felt a strong desire to take action and make a difference, even if it meant causing some chaos in the process. However, looking back, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences. We just kind of rushed in without a clear plan, and it backfired on us.\n\nNow, I'm not just against the war; I think it actually did more harm than good. I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on working with us. It's like they're stuck in a never-ending cycle of conflict, and our presence isn't doing anything to change that. I've kind of lost interest in what's going on over there because of the way things have played out.\n\nSometimes, I feel like they're not even human, the way they conduct themselves in war. It's like they're more savage than civilized, and I don't think they're looking to improve their country; they just want us out. I think we should have left them to their own devices a long time ago.\n\nTo be honest, I think we went to war on a whim, driven by emotions and a desire for revenge, rather than a clear plan. The President might have thought he was doing the right thing, but looking back, I'm not so sure. We couldn't just let the situation go, but we could have handled it better. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and it showed. The lack of unity and a clear plan made things much harder for us.\n\nI don't think we're the right people to change those countries. They've been like that for a long time, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying there forever. In the end, I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying; it's only a matter of time before things collapse once we leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to adapt to some changes. I believe a lot of people are losing faith in the Church because it's not very accepting of certain things. For instance, its views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control seem a bit outdated. I get that the Church has strong opinions on these issues, but maybe if it adopted a more modern perspective, it wouldn't be losing followers. \n\nI've heard that many people are turning away from the Church due to its stance on these topics. They feel that the Church's views are outdated and that it's not considering the opinions of others. If the Church doesn't change its views, I think it'll continue to lose followers.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion might be a major reason why some people can't relate to it. If you personally believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also think the Church's stance on female priests and married priests is outdated. I don't see why women can't be priests or why priests can't have families. The Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's not how the rest of the world works. Most people have careers and families, so why can't priests have both?\n\nIt's hard to say whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past issues, but it's worth considering. The Church's views on these topics might be a major reason why it's losing followers, and it's time for it to adapt to a more modern perspective.",
            "Honestly, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I think that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. I don't think it's fair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. [It just doesn't seem right.]\n\nI think that people don't have control over their sexual orientation, just like I didn't choose to be straight. It's not a conscious choice, and they shouldn't be judged for it. [It's not something they can control.]\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not really a legal or moral concern. It's just a matter of respecting people's choices and who they are. I don't think they should be treated like they've made a mistake or wrong choice. [It's just not fair.]\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because it's none of their business. It's not a matter of national security or morality; they're just not relevant to the issue. [It's just not their place to interfere.] People's sexual orientation is who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. Period.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The concept of gay relationships is fundamentally different from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to compare the two directly. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nOne of the key issues is the lack of civil rights for gay couples. For instance, partners in a gay relationship may not be allowed to visit each other in the hospital or make medical decisions for one another, simply because the law doesn't recognize their relationship as \"family.\" This is unfair, especially considering that gay couples face the same challenges and have the same rates of success in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main reason for the opposition to gay marriage seems to be a misunderstanding of what it means to be gay. Gay couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal document that confirms their union. This is a civil issue, not a religious one. If a civil union is granted, why not call it a marriage?\n\nThe comparison to segregation is apt - separate but unequal is still unequal. Gay couples are not asking for special treatment, but for equal rights. They face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about the impact on children.\n\nSome people worry about the children of gay couples, but this is a complex issue. While it's difficult to predict how children will adjust to society, it's clear that parenting skills are not determined by the parents' sexual orientation. In fact, gay couples can be just as involved in their community as heterosexual couples.\n\nIt's time for the federal government to take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is misguided and hypocritical, especially considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" pledge in the Pledge of Allegiance. It's time to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose one group's moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is not supported by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against this notion, and it's time for people to listen to credible research rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I've got a pretty clear view on this. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it has no benefits. I'm not saying we should make it widely available to the public, no way, that's not what I'm saying. But using it for medicinal purposes? Yeah, I think that's a different story. The thing is, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. I'm talking about stuff like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets – those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have genuine benefits. And if we can acknowledge the benefits of those drugs, why can't we do the same for marijuana? I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, by the way. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, but so can alcohol. It's a tough one, I know. I think we should consider making it legal gradually, but not all at once. That way, people can use it responsibly. The problem is, people have this bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not as bad as some other substances out there. If we could get rid of that image and show people that it's not a terrible thing, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly. And that would be a good thing, especially for medical purposes.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be when I was younger. I used to go to church every Sunday and wear matching outfits, including dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal for me back then, especially since I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. However, things have changed. They now have a 30-minute teenager mass, which is a more relaxed version of the traditional Sunday mass. People dress more casually, especially during summer, and even families who are running late show up in beach clothes. I've also noticed a shift in dress code for morning masses, where people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. It's become much more casual.\n\nAs for other changes, the church I know has become more relaxed. I'm not sure about the politics behind it, but that's how it seems to me. I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the accusations of pedophilia. Some people who are married still become pedophiles, and it's not because they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice, and their attraction to young kids doesn't change just because of a marital status. I also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their own decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nI've seen examples of other religions where priests are allowed to get married, like in the Seventh Heaven faith, where the reverend or minister can be married. While it's a different situation, it shows that it's possible for someone to practice their faith and be married at the same time. I don't think the church could have prevented these accusations by changing its rules on marriage or ordination.\n\nMy opinion is that pedophilia is based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed by upbringing or environment. While it might play a small role in some cases, I believe it's primarily genetic. You can't hide someone's true nature, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's a different story, and they should be ashamed. However, I don't think they were aware of everything that was happening.\n\nThat's my take on the situation. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point.",
            "I have to admit, initially, I was okay with the idea, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks heavily influenced the US decision to invade Iraq. It seemed that the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs – claims that have since been proven false. This really got under my skin, and the Iraq war is a constant source of frustration for me.\n\nIt's hard to ignore the fact that the Bush administration repeatedly misled the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious abuse of power, and I believe it's an impeachable offense to lie to the public like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the US Constitution is also concerning, especially considering their actions since 9/11. It seems they wanted to go to war from the start, and I'm not convinced it was solely about national security.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I believe the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, driven by his father's administration. Expanding the US energy supply was also a likely motive, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve it.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, withdrawing troops now would likely lead to chaos and more deaths. The alternative is a coalition of surrounding nations trying to restore order, but I'm not convinced this is the best solution either. The issue of Iraqi sovereignty will become a major problem, and the interim government's ineffectiveness is clear.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, and the Prime Minister's influence is limited. Radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party are still vying for power, causing friction in the government. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the long-term consequences will be.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out my thoughts on the War in Iraq... I guess my initial reaction is that it all seems a bit pointless since it wasn't even a declared war in the first place. I feel like it was more of a response to Iraq's alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks, so it's hard for me to get excited about it. I don't really follow the details closely, but from what I understand, our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and secure access to their oil resources. However, this strategy seems to be causing more problems than it's solving. If we stay, we risk creating a long-term presence that will be difficult to withdraw from, and if we leave, we'll be seen as abandoning a country we've destabilized. I'm also worried that our attempts to impose democracy will only lead to resentment and a deeper divide between Iraq and the US.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I have a clear stance on the issue, which is probably why I'm struggling to articulate my thoughts. The more I think about it, the more complicated it seems. I guess one thing that does bother me is that we're using military force to assert our power and influence, rather than genuinely working towards a peaceful resolution. I'm not sure if declaring it a war was ever the right approach, considering it wasn't officially sanctioned by Congress.\n\nAt the same time, I do think there are families of soldiers who are affected by the conflict, and it's hard to want the war to end for their sake. However, our presence in Iraq is causing so much suffering and division, and I worry that our efforts to impose our values will only lead to more problems in the long run. Ultimately, I feel like the situation is a complex, messy, and deeply contentious issue that will likely continue for years to come.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state or the government to make it legal or declare it legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially since the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty straightforward and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen it comes to people trying to make it illegal, I think that's essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. We see how most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution that allows for religious tolerance in the US.\n\nEven though there have been plans to make an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradict the constitution. Plus, I believe this would be one of the rare amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government, which doesn't seem right at all.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government shouldn't be involved in this issue. I don't understand why the President is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It's evident that his push for this amendment shows he has a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the President or anyone in government, and there's no real reason behind this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else, and if anything, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've covered all my points.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. \n\nTo be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. Before going to war, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though the two weren't directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and that's just heartbreaking.\n\nWhat they did was remove the country's government, but I don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. They're trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. However, it's not an easy process, and the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal.\n\nIn Vietnam, they were trying to push out Communists and implement democracy, but it wasn't a clear-cut victory. There are always going to be insurgents, and fighting citizens is much harder than fighting an actual army. The US government didn't seem to be prepared for this, and now we're still there, dealing with the aftermath.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes, and I think the government didn't do that in this case. They weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there, with many American troops dying and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take over.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. But it's not that easy to implement a new form of government, and it takes years to make it successful. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, that's my take on the war in Iraq. It's a difficult decision to make, and once you're in, it's hard to leave. We've been there for so long, and we've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them now? It's a tough call, but there's also the issue of the high number of American casualties and how much more is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nGoing back to the reasons for invading Iraq, it's interesting that we're only doing this to Iraq and not other countries. I think it's all about oil and controlling resources. Another reason for the war was the claim of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which actually have those weapons, are not being targeted. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or truthful enough in their decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. But it's probably not going to be that simple.",
            "Honestly, I'm really in favor of gay marriage. I've been supportive for a long time now. I think it's entirely a personal preference and scientific evidence suggests that it can be biologically influenced rather than just a result of social conditioning. Therefore, depriving people of rights because of something they can't control is just inhumane to me.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think politics and government should have a say in this matter. It's a personal issue, a household decision, not something that should be addressed at a state or federal level. In my neighborhood back home, I've seen openly gay couples living together, just like any other families. They do the same things, take their dogs for a walk, and live their lives normally.\n\nI find it ridiculous that President Bush is trying to interpret the meaning of marriage and impose his own views on it. I think it's a personal choice that should be respected.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that research suggests there may be a chemical aspect to being homosexual, something people are predisposed to due to biology rather than environmental factors. For instance, someone growing up with four sisters and no father may not necessarily have anything to do with their sexual orientation.\n\nAs for the issue of marriage, I think it's weird that if a heterosexual couple can get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I believe it should be a private, personal decision, not something the government or national media should be involved in.",
            "Honestly, when you share something online, it becomes a public platform. It's completely out in the open. You can't take back what you've posted - it's there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Whatever you put online will influence people's opinions about you, and if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably report it. You can't just share something like that, because it'll be seen by everyone.\n\nThe internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on social media, you'll likely see their posts. It's not the school that's accessing this information; it's someone who's already connected to you. The school has to take this seriously, as they can't just ignore a potential threat. They might have prevented something terrible from happening if they'd acted sooner.\n\nOf course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, as some people just joke around online. Like that time in our school when it turned out to be a sociology experiment gone wrong. It could be a joke, or it could be a serious threat. In this case, something was overheard at school, and when we found out who said it, we looked into their online profiles and found some concerning posts that might have been meant as a joke but became serious in the context.\n\nWhen you post something online, there's no invasion of privacy - you're putting it out there for everyone to see. If you don't want it shared, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, don't tell them. You can't control how people interpret your online content.\n\nI don't think it's right for school officials to friend their students on social media and monitor their online activity. However, if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's something that's been shared publicly and might pose a threat, they can't just ignore it.\n\nIt's not the school's place to snoop on students' private lives, but if they're brought to their attention, they have to act. For instance, a teacher shouldn't create a fake social media account to keep an eye on their students - that's just crossing a line.\n\nI wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I definitely don't want to see their photos or updates. That's not my job as an R.A. I just want to focus on maintaining a good relationship with them, not monitoring their online activity.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the purpose behind it seemed good - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting just to prove that we're a powerful nation. I question whether the original motives were even pure, given George Bush's father's complicated history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our intention was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair system, that would've been a noble cause. But I think we accomplished that in the first few months of the war. It was a strong statement that spoke for itself. The fact that the conflict has been ongoing for over a year or more is just too prolonged.\n\nI believe that if our original purpose was to free a country from tyranny, that's a just cause for war. However, I think our reasons have been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. We don't want to exit without a decisive victory, but I think that time has come. Their government will eventually have to fend for themselves, and it's time for us to stop draining our economy by spending billions on a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war is staggering, and war shouldn't be a long-term expense. We have our own problems to address, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare, which could be greatly improved with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's sad to see our citizens being killed in a foreign country for a cause we've lost sight of.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm curious about something - isn't it true that a situation was prevented because someone looked through a student's online profile?\n\nApparently, someone searching through online profiles stumbled upon some information and was able to stop something from happening. This got me thinking - I mean, if you post stuff online, you've basically made it available for everyone to see. Websites like Myspace have privacy settings, but if you let someone be your friend, it's like you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that when you put things online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see them. And if someone's able to see that information and prevent a situation from escalating, that's a good thing. Of course, I can see how it'd be tough for one person to monitor everyone's profiles all the time. It's a tough call - do you have someone dedicated to looking through profiles or does that become a form of discrimination?\n\nI don't think it's right for someone to have a job just to monitor people's online activity, but I suppose it depends on the situation. Were they looking for specific information or were they just browsing through? It's a tricky issue - you want to be able to communicate with friends, but at the same time, you don't know who's actually looking at your stuff.\n\nI've got a Facebook account, but I've had some creepy experiences with people messing around with my info. I watched a documentary about a guy who was able to get a girl's screen name and arrange a meeting with her in just a few minutes. It's scary when you think about how much information is out there - people can see your interests, your schedule, your friends... and it's hard to know who's actually looking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I put on my Facebook, but it's a delicate balance - you want to be able to connect with friends without giving too much away. I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking. I've heard of schools banning students from having Myspace accounts, which seems strange - don't they have a right to decide what they put online? It's a complicated issue, and I'm not sure what the solution is.",
            "I'm going to touch on something I've been meaning to discuss - the Iraq War. To be honest, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it because I don't want to be part of the crowd that was against it from the start. However, it's not really relevant anymore since the general consensus worldwide is that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration, which refuses to admit their mistake. If you look at recent polls, it's clear that around 75-80% of the global population thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the US troops stationed there believe it was a poor decision and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure how to put it, but it's been a complete disaster from the start. The conflict was already chaotic, and now pulling out will also be a challenge. The truth is, there's no easy way to navigate the Middle East. I think it's because of the massive cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states, which administrations often struggle to understand. They try to impose democracy, but that's not how other cultures choose to govern themselves. Of course, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a disaster. I genuinely don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't see why we can't leave now. It's striking that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter believe we should leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinion shouldn't be ignored. If we asked them if we should leave and they said yes, it would at least take the blame off us if things go wrong. If we decide to help after that, we might at least be seen as the good guys, even if it's not entirely true.",
            "To be honest, I genuinely believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. It's not just a woman's issue, though - it's also about the specific field of work involved. Overall, I think women face more obstacles because of the \"glass ceiling\" that still exists, even with the promise of equality. Many people struggle to accept women in leadership positions, mainly due to the way society has been raised for so long. This leads to women being overlooked for promotions, even when they're perfectly qualified, simply because they're not traditionally seen as \"upper management material.\"\n\nIt's the same with other industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. People often look down on men who choose to stay at home and care for their children, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be really tough on them, especially if it's their dream to be with their kids and support their family.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it can be tough for men who are serious about their work to be taken seriously, just because they don't fit the traditional mold. People might wonder if they truly understand fashion, simply because they're men. Depending on the field of work, I believe there's definitely gender discrimination in society.\n\nChanging this mindset is difficult because society has a set way of thinking, and we've come a long way since the 1800s. However, progress is slow. But, as women continue to break through into higher positions and become CEOs, and as more men become stay-at-home dads, people are starting to accept these roles more. It's a slow process, but it's happening. People are starting to see that women can be successful in business and that men can be amazing caregivers. To promote this change, we need to highlight the qualities of individuals, rather than forcing it upon people. If we push too hard, people will resist. We need to be at a good balance, where it becomes normalized. I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do right now that hasn't already been done, but I do know that change takes time.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other factors, like where you're from or your background, can lead to discrimination. For example, someone from a rural area with a less polished education might face prejudice from those who emphasize formal education. This can be seen in all sorts of industries, where people often look down on others for not meeting certain standards. It's another example of how complex and multifaceted this issue is.",
            "I think they've taken marijuana from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people won't have to go through the hassle of being arrested and brought to court, which can be a big relief for those involved. However, it's worth noting that even with decriminalization, the long-term effects on a person's record can still be significant, making it harder to get jobs or secure other opportunities. On the other hand, one of the main arguments for decriminalization is that it saves a lot of money for the local government, as it eliminates the need for costly arrests, court appearances, and public defenders.\n\nIn places where people are more open-minded, like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a good move, allowing for more funds to be allocated to important causes like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. While it's true that marijuana shouldn't be completely legal, allowing it to be bought and sold like cigarettes, as it could lead to problems like people smoking and driving, I think the benefits of decriminalization outweigh the drawbacks. Of course, there are valid concerns about the potential negative effects of marijuana on people's lifestyles, but it's also worth noting that it affects different people in different ways, and some are more prone to overuse or addiction.\n\nUltimately, substances like marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to them. Some people can handle them fine, while others may struggle. I think it's essential to approach this issue with a nuanced perspective, recognizing both the potential benefits and drawbacks of decriminalization.",
            "I would say yes, because many traditional practices are rooted in their history and culture. They've done things a certain way for a long time, and it's good to maintain that connection to their heritage. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. \n\nFor instance, the Catholic Church expects its followers to attend church every week and adhere to specific rules. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on individuals who don't strictly follow the doctrine, and they don't accept people who don't fit the mold of a 'perfect' Catholic. They also don't accept people from other faiths. For example, my parents' marriage wasn't recognized by the Catholic Church because my dad was an Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance is hypocritical, considering their teaching to love others. It's contradictory to say we should love others while not accepting them.\n\nI think this outdated mindset is a major issue within the Catholic Church. They stick to their traditional practices, even if they go against their teachings. I'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would prevent pedophilic behavior, as it's a more complex issue. People who would harm children would likely do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different context altogether.\n\nUltimately, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a significant deterrent in preventing such incidents. It would likely happen regardless of their marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're facing today. The thin line between separating church and state and defining marriage is a complicated one that's hard to navigate without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm not sure where I stand, but I think all civil unions should be viewed the same way by the government, regardless of whether they're considered a sacrament. If two people are in a committed relationship, they should be treated equally, with or without tax benefits or government recognition. It's essentially a civil union between two people, and that's what it should be viewed as.\n\nIf every state can come to a logical conclusion, they should push for a federal law that reflects that. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a significant issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a vital enough cause to alter the constitution, just to define or ban gay marriage. It's as simple as that.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a mixed view on the topic of homosexuality since I was raised in a Christian household. I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it a bit confusing for me. While I don't fully agree with that lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something that should be decided by each state individually, rather than by the president.\n\nI figure that since a lot of states are democratic, they'll naturally support gay marriage, while republican states will be against it. If you live in a state that's decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, since you chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI've already kind of answered that, but basically, I don't think President Bush should be able to dictate whether the whole country should ban gay marriage. It should be up to individual states to decide whether or not to legalize it.\n\nI just don't think it's fair for Bush to decide how every state should run itself, since he doesn't live in every state. It's only for a couple of years until he's out of office, and even if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. I think it's better to leave it up to each individual state, since they'll have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nI don't think so, but I think states should have the freedom to make their own decisions without federal interference.",
            "Honestly, I don't agree with that perspective at all. Let me break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and anything you post on it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. In my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent potential school shootings, they have every right to do so because it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students.\n\nThink about it - even if students post under a pseudonym, school officials could still find out their identity through their home IP address or other means. It's not like they're doing anything wrong by monitoring the internet to prevent harm. If they discover students posting about dangerous activities, they're not being invasive; they're just doing their job to keep the school safe.\n\nIt's like when schools conduct lockdown drills to prepare for potential terrorist attacks. They're taking steps to ensure everyone's safety, and that's what school officials were doing in this case. They were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, which could have disastrous consequences. So, while it might seem like an invasion of privacy, I don't think it's unreasonable for them to monitor Myspace if it helps keep the school safe.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in today's digital age, once something is online, it's there forever. You can't just delete it and expect it to disappear. That's why I'm careful about what I post online, even in private messages or emails. You never know who might see it and how it could come back to haunt you.\n\nIn conclusion, while I don't think it's ideal for school officials to monitor Myspace, I understand their motivations. If they're doing it to prevent harm and keep the school safe, I think that's a reasonable approach. However, I do think they should focus on specific concerns rather than broadly monitoring the internet for any potential issues.",
            "Honestly, I've been thinking a lot about the war, and it's given me a lot to consider. At first, I was all for it because nine eleven affected me personally, and I felt like we had to do something in response. I was caught up in the emotional reaction, and I think that led me to overlook some of the potential consequences. Looking back, I realize that we rushed into it without a clear plan, and it's had some serious repercussions.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if I'd call myself for or against the war anymore. I think we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the long-term implications. It's clear that the people in Iraq are more concerned with fighting each other than with us, so I'm not convinced that our presence is making a difference.\n\nTo be honest, the more I learn about the war, the less I care about what's going on in Iraq. I think they're a very different people when it comes to war, and I'm not sure we're equipped to change their ways. It seems like they're more focused on getting rid of us than on improving their own country. I'm not sure that's something we can force them to change.\n\nI also think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge after nine eleven, rather than a rational analysis of the situation. We were more hyped up than thoughtful, and that's led to a lot of problems.\n\nIn hindsight, I think President Bush made a bold move by declaring war on Iraq, but I can understand why he felt it was necessary. At the time, it seemed like we had no choice but to act. However, I do think we could have planned our approach better and been clearer about what we hoped to achieve.\n\nOne thing that's become clear to me is that we're not equipped to change the people of Iraq. They're a complex and deeply divided society, and I'm not sure we can impose our will on them. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the cost and the effort. I think it's time for us to pull out and let them take care of their own problems.\n\nUltimately, I don't think we're doing ourselves any favors by staying in Iraq. We're just delaying the inevitable, and when we leave, the situation will likely collapse. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not, but I do think we should have a clear exit strategy and not just stay there indefinitely."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to adapt to some changes. I believe a lot of people are losing faith in the Church because it's not very accepting of certain things. For instance, its views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control seem a bit outdated. I get that the Church has strong opinions on these issues, but maybe if it adopted a more modern perspective, it wouldn't be losing followers. \n\nI've heard that many people are turning away from the Church due to its stance on these topics. They feel that the Church's views are outdated and that it's not considering the opinions of others. If the Church doesn't change its views, I think it'll continue to lose followers.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion might be a major reason why some people can't relate to it. If you personally believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also think the Church's stance on female priests and married priests is outdated. I don't see why women can't be priests or why priests can't have families. The Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's not how the rest of the world works. Most people have careers and families, so why can't priests have both?\n\nIt's hard to say whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past issues, but it's worth considering. The Church's views on these topics might be a major reason why it's losing followers, and it's time for it to adapt to a more modern perspective.",
            "Honestly, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I think that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. I don't think it's fair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. [It just doesn't seem right.]\n\nI think that people don't have control over their sexual orientation, just like I didn't choose to be straight. It's not a conscious choice, and they shouldn't be judged for it. [It's not something they can control.]\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not really a legal or moral concern. It's just a matter of respecting people's choices and who they are. I don't think they should be treated like they've made a mistake or wrong choice. [It's just not fair.]\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because it's none of their business. It's not a matter of national security or morality; they're just not relevant to the issue. [It's just not their place to interfere.] People's sexual orientation is who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. Period.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The concept of gay relationships is fundamentally different from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to compare the two directly. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nOne of the key issues is the lack of civil rights for gay couples. For instance, partners in a gay relationship may not be allowed to visit each other in the hospital or make medical decisions for one another, simply because the law doesn't recognize their relationship as \"family.\" This is unfair, especially considering that gay couples face the same challenges and have the same rates of success in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main reason for the opposition to gay marriage seems to be a misunderstanding of what it means to be gay. Gay couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal document that confirms their union. This is a civil issue, not a religious one. If a civil union is granted, why not call it a marriage?\n\nThe comparison to segregation is apt - separate but unequal is still unequal. Gay couples are not asking for special treatment, but for equal rights. They face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about the impact on children.\n\nSome people worry about the children of gay couples, but this is a complex issue. While it's difficult to predict how children will adjust to society, it's clear that parenting skills are not determined by the parents' sexual orientation. In fact, gay couples can be just as involved in their community as heterosexual couples.\n\nIt's time for the federal government to take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is misguided and hypocritical, especially considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" pledge in the Pledge of Allegiance. It's time to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose one group's moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is not supported by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against this notion, and it's time for people to listen to credible research rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I've got a pretty clear view on this. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it has no benefits. I'm not saying we should make it widely available to the public, no way, that's not what I'm saying. But using it for medicinal purposes? Yeah, I think that's a different story. The thing is, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. I'm talking about stuff like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets – those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have genuine benefits. And if we can acknowledge the benefits of those drugs, why can't we do the same for marijuana? I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, by the way. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, but so can alcohol. It's a tough one, I know. I think we should consider making it legal gradually, but not all at once. That way, people can use it responsibly. The problem is, people have this bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not as bad as some other substances out there. If we could get rid of that image and show people that it's not a terrible thing, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly. And that would be a good thing, especially for medical purposes.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be when I was younger. I used to go to church every Sunday and wear matching outfits, including dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal for me back then, especially since I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. However, things have changed. They now have a 30-minute teenager mass, which is a more relaxed version of the traditional Sunday mass. People dress more casually, especially during summer, and even families who are running late show up in beach clothes. I've also noticed a shift in dress code for morning masses, where people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. It's become much more casual.\n\nAs for other changes, the church I know has become more relaxed. I'm not sure about the politics behind it, but that's how it seems to me. I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the accusations of pedophilia. Some people who are married still become pedophiles, and it's not because they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice, and their attraction to young kids doesn't change just because of a marital status. I also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their own decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nI've seen examples of other religions where priests are allowed to get married, like in the Seventh Heaven faith, where the reverend or minister can be married. While it's a different situation, it shows that it's possible for someone to practice their faith and be married at the same time. I don't think the church could have prevented these accusations by changing its rules on marriage or ordination.\n\nMy opinion is that pedophilia is based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed by upbringing or environment. While it might play a small role in some cases, I believe it's primarily genetic. You can't hide someone's true nature, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's a different story, and they should be ashamed. However, I don't think they were aware of everything that was happening.\n\nThat's my take on the situation. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point.",
            "I have to admit, initially, I was okay with the idea, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks heavily influenced the US decision to invade Iraq. It seemed that the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs – claims that have since been proven false. This really got under my skin, and the Iraq war is a constant source of frustration for me.\n\nIt's hard to ignore the fact that the Bush administration repeatedly misled the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious abuse of power, and I believe it's an impeachable offense to lie to the public like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the US Constitution is also concerning, especially considering their actions since 9/11. It seems they wanted to go to war from the start, and I'm not convinced it was solely about national security.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I believe the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, driven by his father's administration. Expanding the US energy supply was also a likely motive, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve it.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, withdrawing troops now would likely lead to chaos and more deaths. The alternative is a coalition of surrounding nations trying to restore order, but I'm not convinced this is the best solution either. The issue of Iraqi sovereignty will become a major problem, and the interim government's ineffectiveness is clear.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, and the Prime Minister's influence is limited. Radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party are still vying for power, causing friction in the government. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the long-term consequences will be.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out my thoughts on the War in Iraq... I guess my initial reaction is that it all seems a bit pointless since it wasn't even a declared war in the first place. I feel like it was more of a response to Iraq's alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks, so it's hard for me to get excited about it. I don't really follow the details closely, but from what I understand, our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and secure access to their oil resources. However, this strategy seems to be causing more problems than it's solving. If we stay, we risk creating a long-term presence that will be difficult to withdraw from, and if we leave, we'll be seen as abandoning a country we've destabilized. I'm also worried that our attempts to impose democracy will only lead to resentment and a deeper divide between Iraq and the US.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I have a clear stance on the issue, which is probably why I'm struggling to articulate my thoughts. The more I think about it, the more complicated it seems. I guess one thing that does bother me is that we're using military force to assert our power and influence, rather than genuinely working towards a peaceful resolution. I'm not sure if declaring it a war was ever the right approach, considering it wasn't officially sanctioned by Congress.\n\nAt the same time, I do think there are families of soldiers who are affected by the conflict, and it's hard to want the war to end for their sake. However, our presence in Iraq is causing so much suffering and division, and I worry that our efforts to impose our values will only lead to more problems in the long run. Ultimately, I feel like the situation is a complex, messy, and deeply contentious issue that will likely continue for years to come.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state or the government to make it legal or declare it legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially since the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty straightforward and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen it comes to people trying to make it illegal, I think that's essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. We see how most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution that allows for religious tolerance in the US.\n\nEven though there have been plans to make an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradict the constitution. Plus, I believe this would be one of the rare amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government, which doesn't seem right at all.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government shouldn't be involved in this issue. I don't understand why the President is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It's evident that his push for this amendment shows he has a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the President or anyone in government, and there's no real reason behind this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else, and if anything, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've covered all my points.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. \n\nTo be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. Before going to war, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though the two weren't directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and that's just heartbreaking.\n\nWhat they did was remove the country's government, but I don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. They're trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. However, it's not an easy process, and the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal.\n\nIn Vietnam, they were trying to push out Communists and implement democracy, but it wasn't a clear-cut victory. There are always going to be insurgents, and fighting citizens is much harder than fighting an actual army. The US government didn't seem to be prepared for this, and now we're still there, dealing with the aftermath.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes, and I think the government didn't do that in this case. They weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there, with many American troops dying and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take over.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. But it's not that easy to implement a new form of government, and it takes years to make it successful. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, that's my take on the war in Iraq. It's a difficult decision to make, and once you're in, it's hard to leave. We've been there for so long, and we've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them now? It's a tough call, but there's also the issue of the high number of American casualties and how much more is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nGoing back to the reasons for invading Iraq, it's interesting that we're only doing this to Iraq and not other countries. I think it's all about oil and controlling resources. Another reason for the war was the claim of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which actually have those weapons, are not being targeted. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or truthful enough in their decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. But it's probably not going to be that simple.",
            "Honestly, I'm really in favor of gay marriage. I've been supportive for a long time now. I think it's entirely a personal preference and scientific evidence suggests that it can be biologically influenced rather than just a result of social conditioning. Therefore, depriving people of rights because of something they can't control is just inhumane to me.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think politics and government should have a say in this matter. It's a personal issue, a household decision, not something that should be addressed at a state or federal level. In my neighborhood back home, I've seen openly gay couples living together, just like any other families. They do the same things, take their dogs for a walk, and live their lives normally.\n\nI find it ridiculous that President Bush is trying to interpret the meaning of marriage and impose his own views on it. I think it's a personal choice that should be respected.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that research suggests there may be a chemical aspect to being homosexual, something people are predisposed to due to biology rather than environmental factors. For instance, someone growing up with four sisters and no father may not necessarily have anything to do with their sexual orientation.\n\nAs for the issue of marriage, I think it's weird that if a heterosexual couple can get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I believe it should be a private, personal decision, not something the government or national media should be involved in.",
            "Honestly, when you share something online, it becomes a public platform. It's completely out in the open. You can't take back what you've posted - it's there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Whatever you put online will influence people's opinions about you, and if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably report it. You can't just share something like that, because it'll be seen by everyone.\n\nThe internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on social media, you'll likely see their posts. It's not the school that's accessing this information; it's someone who's already connected to you. The school has to take this seriously, as they can't just ignore a potential threat. They might have prevented something terrible from happening if they'd acted sooner.\n\nOf course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, as some people just joke around online. Like that time in our school when it turned out to be a sociology experiment gone wrong. It could be a joke, or it could be a serious threat. In this case, something was overheard at school, and when we found out who said it, we looked into their online profiles and found some concerning posts that might have been meant as a joke but became serious in the context.\n\nWhen you post something online, there's no invasion of privacy - you're putting it out there for everyone to see. If you don't want it shared, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, don't tell them. You can't control how people interpret your online content.\n\nI don't think it's right for school officials to friend their students on social media and monitor their online activity. However, if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's something that's been shared publicly and might pose a threat, they can't just ignore it.\n\nIt's not the school's place to snoop on students' private lives, but if they're brought to their attention, they have to act. For instance, a teacher shouldn't create a fake social media account to keep an eye on their students - that's just crossing a line.\n\nI wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I definitely don't want to see their photos or updates. That's not my job as an R.A. I just want to focus on maintaining a good relationship with them, not monitoring their online activity.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the purpose behind it seemed good - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting just to prove that we're a powerful nation. I question whether the original motives were even pure, given George Bush's father's complicated history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our intention was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair system, that would've been a noble cause. But I think we accomplished that in the first few months of the war. It was a strong statement that spoke for itself. The fact that the conflict has been ongoing for over a year or more is just too prolonged.\n\nI believe that if our original purpose was to free a country from tyranny, that's a just cause for war. However, I think our reasons have been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. We don't want to exit without a decisive victory, but I think that time has come. Their government will eventually have to fend for themselves, and it's time for us to stop draining our economy by spending billions on a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war is staggering, and war shouldn't be a long-term expense. We have our own problems to address, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare, which could be greatly improved with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's sad to see our citizens being killed in a foreign country for a cause we've lost sight of.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm curious about something - isn't it true that a situation was prevented because someone looked through a student's online profile?\n\nApparently, someone searching through online profiles stumbled upon some information and was able to stop something from happening. This got me thinking - I mean, if you post stuff online, you've basically made it available for everyone to see. Websites like Myspace have privacy settings, but if you let someone be your friend, it's like you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that when you put things online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see them. And if someone's able to see that information and prevent a situation from escalating, that's a good thing. Of course, I can see how it'd be tough for one person to monitor everyone's profiles all the time. It's a tough call - do you have someone dedicated to looking through profiles or does that become a form of discrimination?\n\nI don't think it's right for someone to have a job just to monitor people's online activity, but I suppose it depends on the situation. Were they looking for specific information or were they just browsing through? It's a tricky issue - you want to be able to communicate with friends, but at the same time, you don't know who's actually looking at your stuff.\n\nI've got a Facebook account, but I've had some creepy experiences with people messing around with my info. I watched a documentary about a guy who was able to get a girl's screen name and arrange a meeting with her in just a few minutes. It's scary when you think about how much information is out there - people can see your interests, your schedule, your friends... and it's hard to know who's actually looking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I put on my Facebook, but it's a delicate balance - you want to be able to connect with friends without giving too much away. I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking. I've heard of schools banning students from having Myspace accounts, which seems strange - don't they have a right to decide what they put online? It's a complicated issue, and I'm not sure what the solution is.",
            "I'm going to touch on something I've been meaning to discuss - the Iraq War. To be honest, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it because I don't want to be part of the crowd that was against it from the start. However, it's not really relevant anymore since the general consensus worldwide is that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration, which refuses to admit their mistake. If you look at recent polls, it's clear that around 75-80% of the global population thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the US troops stationed there believe it was a poor decision and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure how to put it, but it's been a complete disaster from the start. The conflict was already chaotic, and now pulling out will also be a challenge. The truth is, there's no easy way to navigate the Middle East. I think it's because of the massive cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states, which administrations often struggle to understand. They try to impose democracy, but that's not how other cultures choose to govern themselves. Of course, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a disaster. I genuinely don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't see why we can't leave now. It's striking that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter believe we should leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinion shouldn't be ignored. If we asked them if we should leave and they said yes, it would at least take the blame off us if things go wrong. If we decide to help after that, we might at least be seen as the good guys, even if it's not entirely true.",
            "To be honest, I genuinely believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. It's not just a woman's issue, though - it's also about the specific field of work involved. Overall, I think women face more obstacles because of the \"glass ceiling\" that still exists, even with the promise of equality. Many people struggle to accept women in leadership positions, mainly due to the way society has been raised for so long. This leads to women being overlooked for promotions, even when they're perfectly qualified, simply because they're not traditionally seen as \"upper management material.\"\n\nIt's the same with other industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. People often look down on men who choose to stay at home and care for their children, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be really tough on them, especially if it's their dream to be with their kids and support their family.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it can be tough for men who are serious about their work to be taken seriously, just because they don't fit the traditional mold. People might wonder if they truly understand fashion, simply because they're men. Depending on the field of work, I believe there's definitely gender discrimination in society.\n\nChanging this mindset is difficult because society has a set way of thinking, and we've come a long way since the 1800s. However, progress is slow. But, as women continue to break through into higher positions and become CEOs, and as more men become stay-at-home dads, people are starting to accept these roles more. It's a slow process, but it's happening. People are starting to see that women can be successful in business and that men can be amazing caregivers. To promote this change, we need to highlight the qualities of individuals, rather than forcing it upon people. If we push too hard, people will resist. We need to be at a good balance, where it becomes normalized. I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do right now that hasn't already been done, but I do know that change takes time.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other factors, like where you're from or your background, can lead to discrimination. For example, someone from a rural area with a less polished education might face prejudice from those who emphasize formal education. This can be seen in all sorts of industries, where people often look down on others for not meeting certain standards. It's another example of how complex and multifaceted this issue is.",
            "I think they've taken marijuana from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people won't have to go through the hassle of being arrested and brought to court, which can be a big relief for those involved. However, it's worth noting that even with decriminalization, the long-term effects on a person's record can still be significant, making it harder to get jobs or secure other opportunities. On the other hand, one of the main arguments for decriminalization is that it saves a lot of money for the local government, as it eliminates the need for costly arrests, court appearances, and public defenders.\n\nIn places where people are more open-minded, like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a good move, allowing for more funds to be allocated to important causes like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. While it's true that marijuana shouldn't be completely legal, allowing it to be bought and sold like cigarettes, as it could lead to problems like people smoking and driving, I think the benefits of decriminalization outweigh the drawbacks. Of course, there are valid concerns about the potential negative effects of marijuana on people's lifestyles, but it's also worth noting that it affects different people in different ways, and some are more prone to overuse or addiction.\n\nUltimately, substances like marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to them. Some people can handle them fine, while others may struggle. I think it's essential to approach this issue with a nuanced perspective, recognizing both the potential benefits and drawbacks of decriminalization.",
            "I would say yes, because many traditional practices are rooted in their history and culture. They've done things a certain way for a long time, and it's good to maintain that connection to their heritage. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. \n\nFor instance, the Catholic Church expects its followers to attend church every week and adhere to specific rules. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on individuals who don't strictly follow the doctrine, and they don't accept people who don't fit the mold of a 'perfect' Catholic. They also don't accept people from other faiths. For example, my parents' marriage wasn't recognized by the Catholic Church because my dad was an Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance is hypocritical, considering their teaching to love others. It's contradictory to say we should love others while not accepting them.\n\nI think this outdated mindset is a major issue within the Catholic Church. They stick to their traditional practices, even if they go against their teachings. I'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would prevent pedophilic behavior, as it's a more complex issue. People who would harm children would likely do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different context altogether.\n\nUltimately, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a significant deterrent in preventing such incidents. It would likely happen regardless of their marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're facing today. The thin line between separating church and state and defining marriage is a complicated one that's hard to navigate without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm not sure where I stand, but I think all civil unions should be viewed the same way by the government, regardless of whether they're considered a sacrament. If two people are in a committed relationship, they should be treated equally, with or without tax benefits or government recognition. It's essentially a civil union between two people, and that's what it should be viewed as.\n\nIf every state can come to a logical conclusion, they should push for a federal law that reflects that. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a significant issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a vital enough cause to alter the constitution, just to define or ban gay marriage. It's as simple as that.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a mixed view on the topic of homosexuality since I was raised in a Christian household. I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it a bit confusing for me. While I don't fully agree with that lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something that should be decided by each state individually, rather than by the president.\n\nI figure that since a lot of states are democratic, they'll naturally support gay marriage, while republican states will be against it. If you live in a state that's decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, since you chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI've already kind of answered that, but basically, I don't think President Bush should be able to dictate whether the whole country should ban gay marriage. It should be up to individual states to decide whether or not to legalize it.\n\nI just don't think it's fair for Bush to decide how every state should run itself, since he doesn't live in every state. It's only for a couple of years until he's out of office, and even if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. I think it's better to leave it up to each individual state, since they'll have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nI don't think so, but I think states should have the freedom to make their own decisions without federal interference.",
            "Honestly, I don't agree with that perspective at all. Let me break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and anything you post on it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. In my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent potential school shootings, they have every right to do so because it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students.\n\nThink about it - even if students post under a pseudonym, school officials could still find out their identity through their home IP address or other means. It's not like they're doing anything wrong by monitoring the internet to prevent harm. If they discover students posting about dangerous activities, they're not being invasive; they're just doing their job to keep the school safe.\n\nIt's like when schools conduct lockdown drills to prepare for potential terrorist attacks. They're taking steps to ensure everyone's safety, and that's what school officials were doing in this case. They were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, which could have disastrous consequences. So, while it might seem like an invasion of privacy, I don't think it's unreasonable for them to monitor Myspace if it helps keep the school safe.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in today's digital age, once something is online, it's there forever. You can't just delete it and expect it to disappear. That's why I'm careful about what I post online, even in private messages or emails. You never know who might see it and how it could come back to haunt you.\n\nIn conclusion, while I don't think it's ideal for school officials to monitor Myspace, I understand their motivations. If they're doing it to prevent harm and keep the school safe, I think that's a reasonable approach. However, I do think they should focus on specific concerns rather than broadly monitoring the internet for any potential issues.",
            "Honestly, I've been thinking a lot about the war, and it's given me a lot to consider. At first, I was all for it because nine eleven affected me personally, and I felt like we had to do something in response. I was caught up in the emotional reaction, and I think that led me to overlook some of the potential consequences. Looking back, I realize that we rushed into it without a clear plan, and it's had some serious repercussions.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if I'd call myself for or against the war anymore. I think we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the long-term implications. It's clear that the people in Iraq are more concerned with fighting each other than with us, so I'm not convinced that our presence is making a difference.\n\nTo be honest, the more I learn about the war, the less I care about what's going on in Iraq. I think they're a very different people when it comes to war, and I'm not sure we're equipped to change their ways. It seems like they're more focused on getting rid of us than on improving their own country. I'm not sure that's something we can force them to change.\n\nI also think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge after nine eleven, rather than a rational analysis of the situation. We were more hyped up than thoughtful, and that's led to a lot of problems.\n\nIn hindsight, I think President Bush made a bold move by declaring war on Iraq, but I can understand why he felt it was necessary. At the time, it seemed like we had no choice but to act. However, I do think we could have planned our approach better and been clearer about what we hoped to achieve.\n\nOne thing that's become clear to me is that we're not equipped to change the people of Iraq. They're a complex and deeply divided society, and I'm not sure we can impose our will on them. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the cost and the effort. I think it's time for us to pull out and let them take care of their own problems.\n\nUltimately, I don't think we're doing ourselves any favors by staying in Iraq. We're just delaying the inevitable, and when we leave, the situation will likely collapse. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not, but I do think we should have a clear exit strategy and not just stay there indefinitely."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to adapt to some changes. I believe a lot of people are losing faith in the Church because it's not very accepting of certain things. For instance, its views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control seem a bit outdated. I get that the Church has strong opinions on these issues, but maybe if it adopted a more modern perspective, it wouldn't be losing followers. \n\nI've heard that many people are turning away from the Church due to its stance on these topics. They feel that the Church's views are outdated and that it's not considering the opinions of others. If the Church doesn't change its views, I think it'll continue to lose followers.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion might be a major reason why some people can't relate to it. If you personally believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also think the Church's stance on female priests and married priests is outdated. I don't see why women can't be priests or why priests can't have families. The Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's not how the rest of the world works. Most people have careers and families, so why can't priests have both?\n\nIt's hard to say whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past issues, but it's worth considering. The Church's views on these topics might be a major reason why it's losing followers, and it's time for it to adapt to a more modern perspective.",
            "Honestly, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I think that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. I don't think it's fair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. [It just doesn't seem right.]\n\nI think that people don't have control over their sexual orientation, just like I didn't choose to be straight. It's not a conscious choice, and they shouldn't be judged for it. [It's not something they can control.]\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not really a legal or moral concern. It's just a matter of respecting people's choices and who they are. I don't think they should be treated like they've made a mistake or wrong choice. [It's just not fair.]\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because it's none of their business. It's not a matter of national security or morality; they're just not relevant to the issue. [It's just not their place to interfere.] People's sexual orientation is who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. Period.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The concept of gay relationships is fundamentally different from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to compare the two directly. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nOne of the key issues is the lack of civil rights for gay couples. For instance, partners in a gay relationship may not be allowed to visit each other in the hospital or make medical decisions for one another, simply because the law doesn't recognize their relationship as \"family.\" This is unfair, especially considering that gay couples face the same challenges and have the same rates of success in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main reason for the opposition to gay marriage seems to be a misunderstanding of what it means to be gay. Gay couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal document that confirms their union. This is a civil issue, not a religious one. If a civil union is granted, why not call it a marriage?\n\nThe comparison to segregation is apt - separate but unequal is still unequal. Gay couples are not asking for special treatment, but for equal rights. They face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about the impact on children.\n\nSome people worry about the children of gay couples, but this is a complex issue. While it's difficult to predict how children will adjust to society, it's clear that parenting skills are not determined by the parents' sexual orientation. In fact, gay couples can be just as involved in their community as heterosexual couples.\n\nIt's time for the federal government to take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is misguided and hypocritical, especially considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" pledge in the Pledge of Allegiance. It's time to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose one group's moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is not supported by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against this notion, and it's time for people to listen to credible research rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I've got a pretty clear view on this. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it has no benefits. I'm not saying we should make it widely available to the public, no way, that's not what I'm saying. But using it for medicinal purposes? Yeah, I think that's a different story. The thing is, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. I'm talking about stuff like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets – those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have genuine benefits. And if we can acknowledge the benefits of those drugs, why can't we do the same for marijuana? I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, by the way. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, but so can alcohol. It's a tough one, I know. I think we should consider making it legal gradually, but not all at once. That way, people can use it responsibly. The problem is, people have this bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not as bad as some other substances out there. If we could get rid of that image and show people that it's not a terrible thing, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly. And that would be a good thing, especially for medical purposes.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be when I was younger. I used to go to church every Sunday and wear matching outfits, including dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal for me back then, especially since I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. However, things have changed. They now have a 30-minute teenager mass, which is a more relaxed version of the traditional Sunday mass. People dress more casually, especially during summer, and even families who are running late show up in beach clothes. I've also noticed a shift in dress code for morning masses, where people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. It's become much more casual.\n\nAs for other changes, the church I know has become more relaxed. I'm not sure about the politics behind it, but that's how it seems to me. I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the accusations of pedophilia. Some people who are married still become pedophiles, and it's not because they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice, and their attraction to young kids doesn't change just because of a marital status. I also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their own decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nI've seen examples of other religions where priests are allowed to get married, like in the Seventh Heaven faith, where the reverend or minister can be married. While it's a different situation, it shows that it's possible for someone to practice their faith and be married at the same time. I don't think the church could have prevented these accusations by changing its rules on marriage or ordination.\n\nMy opinion is that pedophilia is based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed by upbringing or environment. While it might play a small role in some cases, I believe it's primarily genetic. You can't hide someone's true nature, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's a different story, and they should be ashamed. However, I don't think they were aware of everything that was happening.\n\nThat's my take on the situation. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point.",
            "I have to admit, initially, I was okay with the idea, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks heavily influenced the US decision to invade Iraq. It seemed that the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs – claims that have since been proven false. This really got under my skin, and the Iraq war is a constant source of frustration for me.\n\nIt's hard to ignore the fact that the Bush administration repeatedly misled the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious abuse of power, and I believe it's an impeachable offense to lie to the public like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the US Constitution is also concerning, especially considering their actions since 9/11. It seems they wanted to go to war from the start, and I'm not convinced it was solely about national security.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I believe the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, driven by his father's administration. Expanding the US energy supply was also a likely motive, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve it.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, withdrawing troops now would likely lead to chaos and more deaths. The alternative is a coalition of surrounding nations trying to restore order, but I'm not convinced this is the best solution either. The issue of Iraqi sovereignty will become a major problem, and the interim government's ineffectiveness is clear.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, and the Prime Minister's influence is limited. Radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party are still vying for power, causing friction in the government. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the long-term consequences will be.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out my thoughts on the War in Iraq... I guess my initial reaction is that it all seems a bit pointless since it wasn't even a declared war in the first place. I feel like it was more of a response to Iraq's alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks, so it's hard for me to get excited about it. I don't really follow the details closely, but from what I understand, our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and secure access to their oil resources. However, this strategy seems to be causing more problems than it's solving. If we stay, we risk creating a long-term presence that will be difficult to withdraw from, and if we leave, we'll be seen as abandoning a country we've destabilized. I'm also worried that our attempts to impose democracy will only lead to resentment and a deeper divide between Iraq and the US.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I have a clear stance on the issue, which is probably why I'm struggling to articulate my thoughts. The more I think about it, the more complicated it seems. I guess one thing that does bother me is that we're using military force to assert our power and influence, rather than genuinely working towards a peaceful resolution. I'm not sure if declaring it a war was ever the right approach, considering it wasn't officially sanctioned by Congress.\n\nAt the same time, I do think there are families of soldiers who are affected by the conflict, and it's hard to want the war to end for their sake. However, our presence in Iraq is causing so much suffering and division, and I worry that our efforts to impose our values will only lead to more problems in the long run. Ultimately, I feel like the situation is a complex, messy, and deeply contentious issue that will likely continue for years to come.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state or the government to make it legal or declare it legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially since the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty straightforward and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen it comes to people trying to make it illegal, I think that's essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. We see how most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution that allows for religious tolerance in the US.\n\nEven though there have been plans to make an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradict the constitution. Plus, I believe this would be one of the rare amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government, which doesn't seem right at all.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government shouldn't be involved in this issue. I don't understand why the President is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It's evident that his push for this amendment shows he has a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the President or anyone in government, and there's no real reason behind this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else, and if anything, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've covered all my points.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. \n\nTo be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. Before going to war, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though the two weren't directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and that's just heartbreaking.\n\nWhat they did was remove the country's government, but I don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. They're trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. However, it's not an easy process, and the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal.\n\nIn Vietnam, they were trying to push out Communists and implement democracy, but it wasn't a clear-cut victory. There are always going to be insurgents, and fighting citizens is much harder than fighting an actual army. The US government didn't seem to be prepared for this, and now we're still there, dealing with the aftermath.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes, and I think the government didn't do that in this case. They weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there, with many American troops dying and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take over.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. But it's not that easy to implement a new form of government, and it takes years to make it successful. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, that's my take on the war in Iraq. It's a difficult decision to make, and once you're in, it's hard to leave. We've been there for so long, and we've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them now? It's a tough call, but there's also the issue of the high number of American casualties and how much more is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nGoing back to the reasons for invading Iraq, it's interesting that we're only doing this to Iraq and not other countries. I think it's all about oil and controlling resources. Another reason for the war was the claim of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which actually have those weapons, are not being targeted. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or truthful enough in their decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. But it's probably not going to be that simple.",
            "Honestly, I'm really in favor of gay marriage. I've been supportive for a long time now. I think it's entirely a personal preference and scientific evidence suggests that it can be biologically influenced rather than just a result of social conditioning. Therefore, depriving people of rights because of something they can't control is just inhumane to me.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think politics and government should have a say in this matter. It's a personal issue, a household decision, not something that should be addressed at a state or federal level. In my neighborhood back home, I've seen openly gay couples living together, just like any other families. They do the same things, take their dogs for a walk, and live their lives normally.\n\nI find it ridiculous that President Bush is trying to interpret the meaning of marriage and impose his own views on it. I think it's a personal choice that should be respected.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that research suggests there may be a chemical aspect to being homosexual, something people are predisposed to due to biology rather than environmental factors. For instance, someone growing up with four sisters and no father may not necessarily have anything to do with their sexual orientation.\n\nAs for the issue of marriage, I think it's weird that if a heterosexual couple can get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I believe it should be a private, personal decision, not something the government or national media should be involved in.",
            "Honestly, when you share something online, it becomes a public platform. It's completely out in the open. You can't take back what you've posted - it's there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Whatever you put online will influence people's opinions about you, and if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably report it. You can't just share something like that, because it'll be seen by everyone.\n\nThe internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on social media, you'll likely see their posts. It's not the school that's accessing this information; it's someone who's already connected to you. The school has to take this seriously, as they can't just ignore a potential threat. They might have prevented something terrible from happening if they'd acted sooner.\n\nOf course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, as some people just joke around online. Like that time in our school when it turned out to be a sociology experiment gone wrong. It could be a joke, or it could be a serious threat. In this case, something was overheard at school, and when we found out who said it, we looked into their online profiles and found some concerning posts that might have been meant as a joke but became serious in the context.\n\nWhen you post something online, there's no invasion of privacy - you're putting it out there for everyone to see. If you don't want it shared, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, don't tell them. You can't control how people interpret your online content.\n\nI don't think it's right for school officials to friend their students on social media and monitor their online activity. However, if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's something that's been shared publicly and might pose a threat, they can't just ignore it.\n\nIt's not the school's place to snoop on students' private lives, but if they're brought to their attention, they have to act. For instance, a teacher shouldn't create a fake social media account to keep an eye on their students - that's just crossing a line.\n\nI wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I definitely don't want to see their photos or updates. That's not my job as an R.A. I just want to focus on maintaining a good relationship with them, not monitoring their online activity.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the purpose behind it seemed good - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting just to prove that we're a powerful nation. I question whether the original motives were even pure, given George Bush's father's complicated history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our intention was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair system, that would've been a noble cause. But I think we accomplished that in the first few months of the war. It was a strong statement that spoke for itself. The fact that the conflict has been ongoing for over a year or more is just too prolonged.\n\nI believe that if our original purpose was to free a country from tyranny, that's a just cause for war. However, I think our reasons have been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. We don't want to exit without a decisive victory, but I think that time has come. Their government will eventually have to fend for themselves, and it's time for us to stop draining our economy by spending billions on a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war is staggering, and war shouldn't be a long-term expense. We have our own problems to address, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare, which could be greatly improved with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's sad to see our citizens being killed in a foreign country for a cause we've lost sight of.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm curious about something - isn't it true that a situation was prevented because someone looked through a student's online profile?\n\nApparently, someone searching through online profiles stumbled upon some information and was able to stop something from happening. This got me thinking - I mean, if you post stuff online, you've basically made it available for everyone to see. Websites like Myspace have privacy settings, but if you let someone be your friend, it's like you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that when you put things online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see them. And if someone's able to see that information and prevent a situation from escalating, that's a good thing. Of course, I can see how it'd be tough for one person to monitor everyone's profiles all the time. It's a tough call - do you have someone dedicated to looking through profiles or does that become a form of discrimination?\n\nI don't think it's right for someone to have a job just to monitor people's online activity, but I suppose it depends on the situation. Were they looking for specific information or were they just browsing through? It's a tricky issue - you want to be able to communicate with friends, but at the same time, you don't know who's actually looking at your stuff.\n\nI've got a Facebook account, but I've had some creepy experiences with people messing around with my info. I watched a documentary about a guy who was able to get a girl's screen name and arrange a meeting with her in just a few minutes. It's scary when you think about how much information is out there - people can see your interests, your schedule, your friends... and it's hard to know who's actually looking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I put on my Facebook, but it's a delicate balance - you want to be able to connect with friends without giving too much away. I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking. I've heard of schools banning students from having Myspace accounts, which seems strange - don't they have a right to decide what they put online? It's a complicated issue, and I'm not sure what the solution is.",
            "I'm going to touch on something I've been meaning to discuss - the Iraq War. To be honest, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it because I don't want to be part of the crowd that was against it from the start. However, it's not really relevant anymore since the general consensus worldwide is that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration, which refuses to admit their mistake. If you look at recent polls, it's clear that around 75-80% of the global population thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the US troops stationed there believe it was a poor decision and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure how to put it, but it's been a complete disaster from the start. The conflict was already chaotic, and now pulling out will also be a challenge. The truth is, there's no easy way to navigate the Middle East. I think it's because of the massive cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states, which administrations often struggle to understand. They try to impose democracy, but that's not how other cultures choose to govern themselves. Of course, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a disaster. I genuinely don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't see why we can't leave now. It's striking that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter believe we should leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinion shouldn't be ignored. If we asked them if we should leave and they said yes, it would at least take the blame off us if things go wrong. If we decide to help after that, we might at least be seen as the good guys, even if it's not entirely true.",
            "To be honest, I genuinely believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. It's not just a woman's issue, though - it's also about the specific field of work involved. Overall, I think women face more obstacles because of the \"glass ceiling\" that still exists, even with the promise of equality. Many people struggle to accept women in leadership positions, mainly due to the way society has been raised for so long. This leads to women being overlooked for promotions, even when they're perfectly qualified, simply because they're not traditionally seen as \"upper management material.\"\n\nIt's the same with other industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. People often look down on men who choose to stay at home and care for their children, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be really tough on them, especially if it's their dream to be with their kids and support their family.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it can be tough for men who are serious about their work to be taken seriously, just because they don't fit the traditional mold. People might wonder if they truly understand fashion, simply because they're men. Depending on the field of work, I believe there's definitely gender discrimination in society.\n\nChanging this mindset is difficult because society has a set way of thinking, and we've come a long way since the 1800s. However, progress is slow. But, as women continue to break through into higher positions and become CEOs, and as more men become stay-at-home dads, people are starting to accept these roles more. It's a slow process, but it's happening. People are starting to see that women can be successful in business and that men can be amazing caregivers. To promote this change, we need to highlight the qualities of individuals, rather than forcing it upon people. If we push too hard, people will resist. We need to be at a good balance, where it becomes normalized. I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do right now that hasn't already been done, but I do know that change takes time.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other factors, like where you're from or your background, can lead to discrimination. For example, someone from a rural area with a less polished education might face prejudice from those who emphasize formal education. This can be seen in all sorts of industries, where people often look down on others for not meeting certain standards. It's another example of how complex and multifaceted this issue is.",
            "I think they've taken marijuana from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people won't have to go through the hassle of being arrested and brought to court, which can be a big relief for those involved. However, it's worth noting that even with decriminalization, the long-term effects on a person's record can still be significant, making it harder to get jobs or secure other opportunities. On the other hand, one of the main arguments for decriminalization is that it saves a lot of money for the local government, as it eliminates the need for costly arrests, court appearances, and public defenders.\n\nIn places where people are more open-minded, like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a good move, allowing for more funds to be allocated to important causes like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. While it's true that marijuana shouldn't be completely legal, allowing it to be bought and sold like cigarettes, as it could lead to problems like people smoking and driving, I think the benefits of decriminalization outweigh the drawbacks. Of course, there are valid concerns about the potential negative effects of marijuana on people's lifestyles, but it's also worth noting that it affects different people in different ways, and some are more prone to overuse or addiction.\n\nUltimately, substances like marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to them. Some people can handle them fine, while others may struggle. I think it's essential to approach this issue with a nuanced perspective, recognizing both the potential benefits and drawbacks of decriminalization.",
            "I would say yes, because many traditional practices are rooted in their history and culture. They've done things a certain way for a long time, and it's good to maintain that connection to their heritage. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. \n\nFor instance, the Catholic Church expects its followers to attend church every week and adhere to specific rules. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on individuals who don't strictly follow the doctrine, and they don't accept people who don't fit the mold of a 'perfect' Catholic. They also don't accept people from other faiths. For example, my parents' marriage wasn't recognized by the Catholic Church because my dad was an Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance is hypocritical, considering their teaching to love others. It's contradictory to say we should love others while not accepting them.\n\nI think this outdated mindset is a major issue within the Catholic Church. They stick to their traditional practices, even if they go against their teachings. I'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would prevent pedophilic behavior, as it's a more complex issue. People who would harm children would likely do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different context altogether.\n\nUltimately, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a significant deterrent in preventing such incidents. It would likely happen regardless of their marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're facing today. The thin line between separating church and state and defining marriage is a complicated one that's hard to navigate without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm not sure where I stand, but I think all civil unions should be viewed the same way by the government, regardless of whether they're considered a sacrament. If two people are in a committed relationship, they should be treated equally, with or without tax benefits or government recognition. It's essentially a civil union between two people, and that's what it should be viewed as.\n\nIf every state can come to a logical conclusion, they should push for a federal law that reflects that. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a significant issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a vital enough cause to alter the constitution, just to define or ban gay marriage. It's as simple as that.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a mixed view on the topic of homosexuality since I was raised in a Christian household. I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it a bit confusing for me. While I don't fully agree with that lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something that should be decided by each state individually, rather than by the president.\n\nI figure that since a lot of states are democratic, they'll naturally support gay marriage, while republican states will be against it. If you live in a state that's decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, since you chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI've already kind of answered that, but basically, I don't think President Bush should be able to dictate whether the whole country should ban gay marriage. It should be up to individual states to decide whether or not to legalize it.\n\nI just don't think it's fair for Bush to decide how every state should run itself, since he doesn't live in every state. It's only for a couple of years until he's out of office, and even if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. I think it's better to leave it up to each individual state, since they'll have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nI don't think so, but I think states should have the freedom to make their own decisions without federal interference.",
            "Honestly, I don't agree with that perspective at all. Let me break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and anything you post on it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. In my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent potential school shootings, they have every right to do so because it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students.\n\nThink about it - even if students post under a pseudonym, school officials could still find out their identity through their home IP address or other means. It's not like they're doing anything wrong by monitoring the internet to prevent harm. If they discover students posting about dangerous activities, they're not being invasive; they're just doing their job to keep the school safe.\n\nIt's like when schools conduct lockdown drills to prepare for potential terrorist attacks. They're taking steps to ensure everyone's safety, and that's what school officials were doing in this case. They were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, which could have disastrous consequences. So, while it might seem like an invasion of privacy, I don't think it's unreasonable for them to monitor Myspace if it helps keep the school safe.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in today's digital age, once something is online, it's there forever. You can't just delete it and expect it to disappear. That's why I'm careful about what I post online, even in private messages or emails. You never know who might see it and how it could come back to haunt you.\n\nIn conclusion, while I don't think it's ideal for school officials to monitor Myspace, I understand their motivations. If they're doing it to prevent harm and keep the school safe, I think that's a reasonable approach. However, I do think they should focus on specific concerns rather than broadly monitoring the internet for any potential issues.",
            "Honestly, I've been thinking a lot about the war, and it's given me a lot to consider. At first, I was all for it because nine eleven affected me personally, and I felt like we had to do something in response. I was caught up in the emotional reaction, and I think that led me to overlook some of the potential consequences. Looking back, I realize that we rushed into it without a clear plan, and it's had some serious repercussions.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if I'd call myself for or against the war anymore. I think we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the long-term implications. It's clear that the people in Iraq are more concerned with fighting each other than with us, so I'm not convinced that our presence is making a difference.\n\nTo be honest, the more I learn about the war, the less I care about what's going on in Iraq. I think they're a very different people when it comes to war, and I'm not sure we're equipped to change their ways. It seems like they're more focused on getting rid of us than on improving their own country. I'm not sure that's something we can force them to change.\n\nI also think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge after nine eleven, rather than a rational analysis of the situation. We were more hyped up than thoughtful, and that's led to a lot of problems.\n\nIn hindsight, I think President Bush made a bold move by declaring war on Iraq, but I can understand why he felt it was necessary. At the time, it seemed like we had no choice but to act. However, I do think we could have planned our approach better and been clearer about what we hoped to achieve.\n\nOne thing that's become clear to me is that we're not equipped to change the people of Iraq. They're a complex and deeply divided society, and I'm not sure we can impose our will on them. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the cost and the effort. I think it's time for us to pull out and let them take care of their own problems.\n\nUltimately, I don't think we're doing ourselves any favors by staying in Iraq. We're just delaying the inevitable, and when we leave, the situation will likely collapse. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not, but I do think we should have a clear exit strategy and not just stay there indefinitely."
