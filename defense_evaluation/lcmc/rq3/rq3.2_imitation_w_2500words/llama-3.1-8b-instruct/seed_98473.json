            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to adapt to some changes. I believe a lot of people are losing faith in the Church because it's not very accepting of certain things. For instance, its views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control seem a bit outdated. I get that the Church has strong opinions on these issues, but maybe if it adopted a more modern perspective, it wouldn't be losing followers. \n\nI've heard that many people are turning away from the Church due to its stance on these topics. They feel that the Church's views are outdated and that it's not considering the opinions of others. If the Church doesn't change its views, I think it'll continue to lose followers.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion might be a major reason why some people can't relate to it. If you personally believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also think the Church's stance on female priests and married priests is outdated. I don't see why women can't be priests or why priests can't have families. The Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's not how the rest of the world works. Most people have careers and families, so why can't priests have both?\n\nIt's hard to say whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past issues, but it's worth considering. The Church's views on these topics might be a major reason why it's losing followers, and it's time for it to adapt to a more modern perspective.",
            "Honestly, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I think that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. I don't think it's fair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. [It just doesn't seem right.]\n\nI think that people don't have control over their sexual orientation, just like I didn't choose to be straight. It's not a conscious choice, and they shouldn't be judged for it. [It's not something they can control.]\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not really a legal or moral concern. It's just a matter of respecting people's choices and who they are. I don't think they should be treated like they've made a mistake or wrong choice. [It's just not fair.]\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because it's none of their business. It's not a matter of national security or morality; they're just not relevant to the issue. [It's just not their place to interfere.] People's sexual orientation is who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. Period.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The concept of gay relationships is fundamentally different from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to compare the two directly. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nOne of the key issues is the lack of civil rights for gay couples. For instance, partners in a gay relationship may not be allowed to visit each other in the hospital or make medical decisions for one another, simply because the law doesn't recognize their relationship as \"family.\" This is unfair, especially considering that gay couples face the same challenges and have the same rates of success in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main reason for the opposition to gay marriage seems to be a misunderstanding of what it means to be gay. Gay couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal document that confirms their union. This is a civil issue, not a religious one. If a civil union is granted, why not call it a marriage?\n\nThe comparison to segregation is apt - separate but unequal is still unequal. Gay couples are not asking for special treatment, but for equal rights. They face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about the impact on children.\n\nSome people worry about the children of gay couples, but this is a complex issue. While it's difficult to predict how children will adjust to society, it's clear that parenting skills are not determined by the parents' sexual orientation. In fact, gay couples can be just as involved in their community as heterosexual couples.\n\nIt's time for the federal government to take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is misguided and hypocritical, especially considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" pledge in the Pledge of Allegiance. It's time to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose one group's moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is not supported by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against this notion, and it's time for people to listen to credible research rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I've got a pretty clear view on this. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it has no benefits. I'm not saying we should make it widely available to the public, no way, that's not what I'm saying. But using it for medicinal purposes? Yeah, I think that's a different story. The thing is, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. I'm talking about stuff like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets – those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have genuine benefits. And if we can acknowledge the benefits of those drugs, why can't we do the same for marijuana? I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, by the way. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, but so can alcohol. It's a tough one, I know. I think we should consider making it legal gradually, but not all at once. That way, people can use it responsibly. The problem is, people have this bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not as bad as some other substances out there. If we could get rid of that image and show people that it's not a terrible thing, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly. And that would be a good thing, especially for medical purposes.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be when I was younger. I used to go to church every Sunday and wear matching outfits, including dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal for me back then, especially since I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. However, things have changed. They now have a 30-minute teenager mass, which is a more relaxed version of the traditional Sunday mass. People dress more casually, especially during summer, and even families who are running late show up in beach clothes. I've also noticed a shift in dress code for morning masses, where people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. It's become much more casual.\n\nAs for other changes, the church I know has become more relaxed. I'm not sure about the politics behind it, but that's how it seems to me. I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the accusations of pedophilia. Some people who are married still become pedophiles, and it's not because they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice, and their attraction to young kids doesn't change just because of a marital status. I also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their own decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nI've seen examples of other religions where priests are allowed to get married, like in the Seventh Heaven faith, where the reverend or minister can be married. While it's a different situation, it shows that it's possible for someone to practice their faith and be married at the same time. I don't think the church could have prevented these accusations by changing its rules on marriage or ordination.\n\nMy opinion is that pedophilia is based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed by upbringing or environment. While it might play a small role in some cases, I believe it's primarily genetic. You can't hide someone's true nature, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's a different story, and they should be ashamed. However, I don't think they were aware of everything that was happening.\n\nThat's my take on the situation. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point.",
            "I have to admit, initially, I was okay with the idea, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks heavily influenced the US decision to invade Iraq. It seemed that the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs – claims that have since been proven false. This really got under my skin, and the Iraq war is a constant source of frustration for me.\n\nIt's hard to ignore the fact that the Bush administration repeatedly misled the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious abuse of power, and I believe it's an impeachable offense to lie to the public like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the US Constitution is also concerning, especially considering their actions since 9/11. It seems they wanted to go to war from the start, and I'm not convinced it was solely about national security.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I believe the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, driven by his father's administration. Expanding the US energy supply was also a likely motive, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve it.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, withdrawing troops now would likely lead to chaos and more deaths. The alternative is a coalition of surrounding nations trying to restore order, but I'm not convinced this is the best solution either. The issue of Iraqi sovereignty will become a major problem, and the interim government's ineffectiveness is clear.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, and the Prime Minister's influence is limited. Radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party are still vying for power, causing friction in the government. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the long-term consequences will be.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out my thoughts on the War in Iraq... I guess my initial reaction is that it all seems a bit pointless since it wasn't even a declared war in the first place. I feel like it was more of a response to Iraq's alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks, so it's hard for me to get excited about it. I don't really follow the details closely, but from what I understand, our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and secure access to their oil resources. However, this strategy seems to be causing more problems than it's solving. If we stay, we risk creating a long-term presence that will be difficult to withdraw from, and if we leave, we'll be seen as abandoning a country we've destabilized. I'm also worried that our attempts to impose democracy will only lead to resentment and a deeper divide between Iraq and the US.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I have a clear stance on the issue, which is probably why I'm struggling to articulate my thoughts. The more I think about it, the more complicated it seems. I guess one thing that does bother me is that we're using military force to assert our power and influence, rather than genuinely working towards a peaceful resolution. I'm not sure if declaring it a war was ever the right approach, considering it wasn't officially sanctioned by Congress.\n\nAt the same time, I do think there are families of soldiers who are affected by the conflict, and it's hard to want the war to end for their sake. However, our presence in Iraq is causing so much suffering and division, and I worry that our efforts to impose our values will only lead to more problems in the long run. Ultimately, I feel like the situation is a complex, messy, and deeply contentious issue that will likely continue for years to come.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state or the government to make it legal or declare it legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially since the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty straightforward and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen it comes to people trying to make it illegal, I think that's essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. We see how most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution that allows for religious tolerance in the US.\n\nEven though there have been plans to make an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradict the constitution. Plus, I believe this would be one of the rare amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government, which doesn't seem right at all.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government shouldn't be involved in this issue. I don't understand why the President is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It's evident that his push for this amendment shows he has a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the President or anyone in government, and there's no real reason behind this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else, and if anything, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've covered all my points.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. \n\nTo be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. Before going to war, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though the two weren't directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and that's just heartbreaking.\n\nWhat they did was remove the country's government, but I don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. They're trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. However, it's not an easy process, and the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal.\n\nIn Vietnam, they were trying to push out Communists and implement democracy, but it wasn't a clear-cut victory. There are always going to be insurgents, and fighting citizens is much harder than fighting an actual army. The US government didn't seem to be prepared for this, and now we're still there, dealing with the aftermath.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes, and I think the government didn't do that in this case. They weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there, with many American troops dying and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take over.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. But it's not that easy to implement a new form of government, and it takes years to make it successful. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, that's my take on the war in Iraq. It's a difficult decision to make, and once you're in, it's hard to leave. We've been there for so long, and we've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them now? It's a tough call, but there's also the issue of the high number of American casualties and how much more is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nGoing back to the reasons for invading Iraq, it's interesting that we're only doing this to Iraq and not other countries. I think it's all about oil and controlling resources. Another reason for the war was the claim of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which actually have those weapons, are not being targeted. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or truthful enough in their decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. But it's probably not going to be that simple.",
            "Honestly, I'm really in favor of gay marriage. I've been supportive for a long time now. I think it's entirely a personal preference and scientific evidence suggests that it can be biologically influenced rather than just a result of social conditioning. Therefore, depriving people of rights because of something they can't control is just inhumane to me.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think politics and government should have a say in this matter. It's a personal issue, a household decision, not something that should be addressed at a state or federal level. In my neighborhood back home, I've seen openly gay couples living together, just like any other families. They do the same things, take their dogs for a walk, and live their lives normally.\n\nI find it ridiculous that President Bush is trying to interpret the meaning of marriage and impose his own views on it. I think it's a personal choice that should be respected.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that research suggests there may be a chemical aspect to being homosexual, something people are predisposed to due to biology rather than environmental factors. For instance, someone growing up with four sisters and no father may not necessarily have anything to do with their sexual orientation.\n\nAs for the issue of marriage, I think it's weird that if a heterosexual couple can get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I believe it should be a private, personal decision, not something the government or national media should be involved in.",
            "Honestly, when you share something online, it becomes a public platform. It's completely out in the open. You can't take back what you've posted - it's there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Whatever you put online will influence people's opinions about you, and if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably report it. You can't just share something like that, because it'll be seen by everyone.\n\nThe internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on social media, you'll likely see their posts. It's not the school that's accessing this information; it's someone who's already connected to you. The school has to take this seriously, as they can't just ignore a potential threat. They might have prevented something terrible from happening if they'd acted sooner.\n\nOf course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, as some people just joke around online. Like that time in our school when it turned out to be a sociology experiment gone wrong. It could be a joke, or it could be a serious threat. In this case, something was overheard at school, and when we found out who said it, we looked into their online profiles and found some concerning posts that might have been meant as a joke but became serious in the context.\n\nWhen you post something online, there's no invasion of privacy - you're putting it out there for everyone to see. If you don't want it shared, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, don't tell them. You can't control how people interpret your online content.\n\nI don't think it's right for school officials to friend their students on social media and monitor their online activity. However, if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's something that's been shared publicly and might pose a threat, they can't just ignore it.\n\nIt's not the school's place to snoop on students' private lives, but if they're brought to their attention, they have to act. For instance, a teacher shouldn't create a fake social media account to keep an eye on their students - that's just crossing a line.\n\nI wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I definitely don't want to see their photos or updates. That's not my job as an R.A. I just want to focus on maintaining a good relationship with them, not monitoring their online activity.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the purpose behind it seemed good - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting just to prove that we're a powerful nation. I question whether the original motives were even pure, given George Bush's father's complicated history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our intention was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair system, that would've been a noble cause. But I think we accomplished that in the first few months of the war. It was a strong statement that spoke for itself. The fact that the conflict has been ongoing for over a year or more is just too prolonged.\n\nI believe that if our original purpose was to free a country from tyranny, that's a just cause for war. However, I think our reasons have been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. We don't want to exit without a decisive victory, but I think that time has come. Their government will eventually have to fend for themselves, and it's time for us to stop draining our economy by spending billions on a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war is staggering, and war shouldn't be a long-term expense. We have our own problems to address, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare, which could be greatly improved with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's sad to see our citizens being killed in a foreign country for a cause we've lost sight of.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm curious about something - isn't it true that a situation was prevented because someone looked through a student's online profile?\n\nApparently, someone searching through online profiles stumbled upon some information and was able to stop something from happening. This got me thinking - I mean, if you post stuff online, you've basically made it available for everyone to see. Websites like Myspace have privacy settings, but if you let someone be your friend, it's like you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that when you put things online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see them. And if someone's able to see that information and prevent a situation from escalating, that's a good thing. Of course, I can see how it'd be tough for one person to monitor everyone's profiles all the time. It's a tough call - do you have someone dedicated to looking through profiles or does that become a form of discrimination?\n\nI don't think it's right for someone to have a job just to monitor people's online activity, but I suppose it depends on the situation. Were they looking for specific information or were they just browsing through? It's a tricky issue - you want to be able to communicate with friends, but at the same time, you don't know who's actually looking at your stuff.\n\nI've got a Facebook account, but I've had some creepy experiences with people messing around with my info. I watched a documentary about a guy who was able to get a girl's screen name and arrange a meeting with her in just a few minutes. It's scary when you think about how much information is out there - people can see your interests, your schedule, your friends... and it's hard to know who's actually looking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I put on my Facebook, but it's a delicate balance - you want to be able to connect with friends without giving too much away. I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking. I've heard of schools banning students from having Myspace accounts, which seems strange - don't they have a right to decide what they put online? It's a complicated issue, and I'm not sure what the solution is.",
            "I'm going to touch on something I've been meaning to discuss - the Iraq War. To be honest, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it because I don't want to be part of the crowd that was against it from the start. However, it's not really relevant anymore since the general consensus worldwide is that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration, which refuses to admit their mistake. If you look at recent polls, it's clear that around 75-80% of the global population thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the US troops stationed there believe it was a poor decision and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure how to put it, but it's been a complete disaster from the start. The conflict was already chaotic, and now pulling out will also be a challenge. The truth is, there's no easy way to navigate the Middle East. I think it's because of the massive cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states, which administrations often struggle to understand. They try to impose democracy, but that's not how other cultures choose to govern themselves. Of course, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a disaster. I genuinely don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't see why we can't leave now. It's striking that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter believe we should leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinion shouldn't be ignored. If we asked them if we should leave and they said yes, it would at least take the blame off us if things go wrong. If we decide to help after that, we might at least be seen as the good guys, even if it's not entirely true.",
            "To be honest, I genuinely believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. It's not just a woman's issue, though - it's also about the specific field of work involved. Overall, I think women face more obstacles because of the \"glass ceiling\" that still exists, even with the promise of equality. Many people struggle to accept women in leadership positions, mainly due to the way society has been raised for so long. This leads to women being overlooked for promotions, even when they're perfectly qualified, simply because they're not traditionally seen as \"upper management material.\"\n\nIt's the same with other industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. People often look down on men who choose to stay at home and care for their children, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be really tough on them, especially if it's their dream to be with their kids and support their family.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it can be tough for men who are serious about their work to be taken seriously, just because they don't fit the traditional mold. People might wonder if they truly understand fashion, simply because they're men. Depending on the field of work, I believe there's definitely gender discrimination in society.\n\nChanging this mindset is difficult because society has a set way of thinking, and we've come a long way since the 1800s. However, progress is slow. But, as women continue to break through into higher positions and become CEOs, and as more men become stay-at-home dads, people are starting to accept these roles more. It's a slow process, but it's happening. People are starting to see that women can be successful in business and that men can be amazing caregivers. To promote this change, we need to highlight the qualities of individuals, rather than forcing it upon people. If we push too hard, people will resist. We need to be at a good balance, where it becomes normalized. I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do right now that hasn't already been done, but I do know that change takes time.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other factors, like where you're from or your background, can lead to discrimination. For example, someone from a rural area with a less polished education might face prejudice from those who emphasize formal education. This can be seen in all sorts of industries, where people often look down on others for not meeting certain standards. It's another example of how complex and multifaceted this issue is.",
            "I think they've taken marijuana from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people won't have to go through the hassle of being arrested and brought to court, which can be a big relief for those involved. However, it's worth noting that even with decriminalization, the long-term effects on a person's record can still be significant, making it harder to get jobs or secure other opportunities. On the other hand, one of the main arguments for decriminalization is that it saves a lot of money for the local government, as it eliminates the need for costly arrests, court appearances, and public defenders.\n\nIn places where people are more open-minded, like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a good move, allowing for more funds to be allocated to important causes like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. While it's true that marijuana shouldn't be completely legal, allowing it to be bought and sold like cigarettes, as it could lead to problems like people smoking and driving, I think the benefits of decriminalization outweigh the drawbacks. Of course, there are valid concerns about the potential negative effects of marijuana on people's lifestyles, but it's also worth noting that it affects different people in different ways, and some are more prone to overuse or addiction.\n\nUltimately, substances like marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to them. Some people can handle them fine, while others may struggle. I think it's essential to approach this issue with a nuanced perspective, recognizing both the potential benefits and drawbacks of decriminalization.",
            "I would say yes, because many traditional practices are rooted in their history and culture. They've done things a certain way for a long time, and it's good to maintain that connection to their heritage. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. \n\nFor instance, the Catholic Church expects its followers to attend church every week and adhere to specific rules. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on individuals who don't strictly follow the doctrine, and they don't accept people who don't fit the mold of a 'perfect' Catholic. They also don't accept people from other faiths. For example, my parents' marriage wasn't recognized by the Catholic Church because my dad was an Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance is hypocritical, considering their teaching to love others. It's contradictory to say we should love others while not accepting them.\n\nI think this outdated mindset is a major issue within the Catholic Church. They stick to their traditional practices, even if they go against their teachings. I'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would prevent pedophilic behavior, as it's a more complex issue. People who would harm children would likely do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different context altogether.\n\nUltimately, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a significant deterrent in preventing such incidents. It would likely happen regardless of their marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're facing today. The thin line between separating church and state and defining marriage is a complicated one that's hard to navigate without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm not sure where I stand, but I think all civil unions should be viewed the same way by the government, regardless of whether they're considered a sacrament. If two people are in a committed relationship, they should be treated equally, with or without tax benefits or government recognition. It's essentially a civil union between two people, and that's what it should be viewed as.\n\nIf every state can come to a logical conclusion, they should push for a federal law that reflects that. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a significant issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a vital enough cause to alter the constitution, just to define or ban gay marriage. It's as simple as that.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a mixed view on the topic of homosexuality since I was raised in a Christian household. I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it a bit confusing for me. While I don't fully agree with that lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something that should be decided by each state individually, rather than by the president.\n\nI figure that since a lot of states are democratic, they'll naturally support gay marriage, while republican states will be against it. If you live in a state that's decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, since you chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI've already kind of answered that, but basically, I don't think President Bush should be able to dictate whether the whole country should ban gay marriage. It should be up to individual states to decide whether or not to legalize it.\n\nI just don't think it's fair for Bush to decide how every state should run itself, since he doesn't live in every state. It's only for a couple of years until he's out of office, and even if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. I think it's better to leave it up to each individual state, since they'll have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nI don't think so, but I think states should have the freedom to make their own decisions without federal interference.",
            "Honestly, I don't agree with that perspective at all. Let me break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and anything you post on it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. In my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent potential school shootings, they have every right to do so because it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students.\n\nThink about it - even if students post under a pseudonym, school officials could still find out their identity through their home IP address or other means. It's not like they're doing anything wrong by monitoring the internet to prevent harm. If they discover students posting about dangerous activities, they're not being invasive; they're just doing their job to keep the school safe.\n\nIt's like when schools conduct lockdown drills to prepare for potential terrorist attacks. They're taking steps to ensure everyone's safety, and that's what school officials were doing in this case. They were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, which could have disastrous consequences. So, while it might seem like an invasion of privacy, I don't think it's unreasonable for them to monitor Myspace if it helps keep the school safe.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in today's digital age, once something is online, it's there forever. You can't just delete it and expect it to disappear. That's why I'm careful about what I post online, even in private messages or emails. You never know who might see it and how it could come back to haunt you.\n\nIn conclusion, while I don't think it's ideal for school officials to monitor Myspace, I understand their motivations. If they're doing it to prevent harm and keep the school safe, I think that's a reasonable approach. However, I do think they should focus on specific concerns rather than broadly monitoring the internet for any potential issues.",
            "Honestly, I've been thinking a lot about the war, and it's given me a lot to consider. At first, I was all for it because nine eleven affected me personally, and I felt like we had to do something in response. I was caught up in the emotional reaction, and I think that led me to overlook some of the potential consequences. Looking back, I realize that we rushed into it without a clear plan, and it's had some serious repercussions.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if I'd call myself for or against the war anymore. I think we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the long-term implications. It's clear that the people in Iraq are more concerned with fighting each other than with us, so I'm not convinced that our presence is making a difference.\n\nTo be honest, the more I learn about the war, the less I care about what's going on in Iraq. I think they're a very different people when it comes to war, and I'm not sure we're equipped to change their ways. It seems like they're more focused on getting rid of us than on improving their own country. I'm not sure that's something we can force them to change.\n\nI also think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge after nine eleven, rather than a rational analysis of the situation. We were more hyped up than thoughtful, and that's led to a lot of problems.\n\nIn hindsight, I think President Bush made a bold move by declaring war on Iraq, but I can understand why he felt it was necessary. At the time, it seemed like we had no choice but to act. However, I do think we could have planned our approach better and been clearer about what we hoped to achieve.\n\nOne thing that's become clear to me is that we're not equipped to change the people of Iraq. They're a complex and deeply divided society, and I'm not sure we can impose our will on them. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the cost and the effort. I think it's time for us to pull out and let them take care of their own problems.\n\nUltimately, I don't think we're doing ourselves any favors by staying in Iraq. We're just delaying the inevitable, and when we leave, the situation will likely collapse. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not, but I do think we should have a clear exit strategy and not just stay there indefinitely."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to adapt to some changes. I believe a lot of people are losing faith in the Church because it's not very accepting of certain things. For instance, its views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control seem a bit outdated. I get that the Church has strong opinions on these issues, but maybe if it adopted a more modern perspective, it wouldn't be losing followers. \n\nI've heard that many people are turning away from the Church due to its stance on these topics. They feel that the Church's views are outdated and that it's not considering the opinions of others. If the Church doesn't change its views, I think it'll continue to lose followers.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion might be a major reason why some people can't relate to it. If you personally believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also think the Church's stance on female priests and married priests is outdated. I don't see why women can't be priests or why priests can't have families. The Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's not how the rest of the world works. Most people have careers and families, so why can't priests have both?\n\nIt's hard to say whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past issues, but it's worth considering. The Church's views on these topics might be a major reason why it's losing followers, and it's time for it to adapt to a more modern perspective.",
            "Honestly, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I think that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. I don't think it's fair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. [It just doesn't seem right.]\n\nI think that people don't have control over their sexual orientation, just like I didn't choose to be straight. It's not a conscious choice, and they shouldn't be judged for it. [It's not something they can control.]\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not really a legal or moral concern. It's just a matter of respecting people's choices and who they are. I don't think they should be treated like they've made a mistake or wrong choice. [It's just not fair.]\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because it's none of their business. It's not a matter of national security or morality; they're just not relevant to the issue. [It's just not their place to interfere.] People's sexual orientation is who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. Period.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The concept of gay relationships is fundamentally different from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to compare the two directly. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nOne of the key issues is the lack of civil rights for gay couples. For instance, partners in a gay relationship may not be allowed to visit each other in the hospital or make medical decisions for one another, simply because the law doesn't recognize their relationship as \"family.\" This is unfair, especially considering that gay couples face the same challenges and have the same rates of success in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main reason for the opposition to gay marriage seems to be a misunderstanding of what it means to be gay. Gay couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal document that confirms their union. This is a civil issue, not a religious one. If a civil union is granted, why not call it a marriage?\n\nThe comparison to segregation is apt - separate but unequal is still unequal. Gay couples are not asking for special treatment, but for equal rights. They face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about the impact on children.\n\nSome people worry about the children of gay couples, but this is a complex issue. While it's difficult to predict how children will adjust to society, it's clear that parenting skills are not determined by the parents' sexual orientation. In fact, gay couples can be just as involved in their community as heterosexual couples.\n\nIt's time for the federal government to take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is misguided and hypocritical, especially considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" pledge in the Pledge of Allegiance. It's time to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose one group's moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is not supported by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against this notion, and it's time for people to listen to credible research rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I've got a pretty clear view on this. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it has no benefits. I'm not saying we should make it widely available to the public, no way, that's not what I'm saying. But using it for medicinal purposes? Yeah, I think that's a different story. The thing is, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. I'm talking about stuff like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets – those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have genuine benefits. And if we can acknowledge the benefits of those drugs, why can't we do the same for marijuana? I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, by the way. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, but so can alcohol. It's a tough one, I know. I think we should consider making it legal gradually, but not all at once. That way, people can use it responsibly. The problem is, people have this bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not as bad as some other substances out there. If we could get rid of that image and show people that it's not a terrible thing, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly. And that would be a good thing, especially for medical purposes.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be when I was younger. I used to go to church every Sunday and wear matching outfits, including dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal for me back then, especially since I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. However, things have changed. They now have a 30-minute teenager mass, which is a more relaxed version of the traditional Sunday mass. People dress more casually, especially during summer, and even families who are running late show up in beach clothes. I've also noticed a shift in dress code for morning masses, where people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. It's become much more casual.\n\nAs for other changes, the church I know has become more relaxed. I'm not sure about the politics behind it, but that's how it seems to me. I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the accusations of pedophilia. Some people who are married still become pedophiles, and it's not because they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice, and their attraction to young kids doesn't change just because of a marital status. I also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their own decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nI've seen examples of other religions where priests are allowed to get married, like in the Seventh Heaven faith, where the reverend or minister can be married. While it's a different situation, it shows that it's possible for someone to practice their faith and be married at the same time. I don't think the church could have prevented these accusations by changing its rules on marriage or ordination.\n\nMy opinion is that pedophilia is based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed by upbringing or environment. While it might play a small role in some cases, I believe it's primarily genetic. You can't hide someone's true nature, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's a different story, and they should be ashamed. However, I don't think they were aware of everything that was happening.\n\nThat's my take on the situation. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point.",
            "I have to admit, initially, I was okay with the idea, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks heavily influenced the US decision to invade Iraq. It seemed that the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs – claims that have since been proven false. This really got under my skin, and the Iraq war is a constant source of frustration for me.\n\nIt's hard to ignore the fact that the Bush administration repeatedly misled the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious abuse of power, and I believe it's an impeachable offense to lie to the public like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the US Constitution is also concerning, especially considering their actions since 9/11. It seems they wanted to go to war from the start, and I'm not convinced it was solely about national security.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I believe the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, driven by his father's administration. Expanding the US energy supply was also a likely motive, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve it.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, withdrawing troops now would likely lead to chaos and more deaths. The alternative is a coalition of surrounding nations trying to restore order, but I'm not convinced this is the best solution either. The issue of Iraqi sovereignty will become a major problem, and the interim government's ineffectiveness is clear.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, and the Prime Minister's influence is limited. Radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party are still vying for power, causing friction in the government. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the long-term consequences will be.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out my thoughts on the War in Iraq... I guess my initial reaction is that it all seems a bit pointless since it wasn't even a declared war in the first place. I feel like it was more of a response to Iraq's alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks, so it's hard for me to get excited about it. I don't really follow the details closely, but from what I understand, our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and secure access to their oil resources. However, this strategy seems to be causing more problems than it's solving. If we stay, we risk creating a long-term presence that will be difficult to withdraw from, and if we leave, we'll be seen as abandoning a country we've destabilized. I'm also worried that our attempts to impose democracy will only lead to resentment and a deeper divide between Iraq and the US.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I have a clear stance on the issue, which is probably why I'm struggling to articulate my thoughts. The more I think about it, the more complicated it seems. I guess one thing that does bother me is that we're using military force to assert our power and influence, rather than genuinely working towards a peaceful resolution. I'm not sure if declaring it a war was ever the right approach, considering it wasn't officially sanctioned by Congress.\n\nAt the same time, I do think there are families of soldiers who are affected by the conflict, and it's hard to want the war to end for their sake. However, our presence in Iraq is causing so much suffering and division, and I worry that our efforts to impose our values will only lead to more problems in the long run. Ultimately, I feel like the situation is a complex, messy, and deeply contentious issue that will likely continue for years to come.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state or the government to make it legal or declare it legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially since the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty straightforward and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen it comes to people trying to make it illegal, I think that's essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. We see how most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution that allows for religious tolerance in the US.\n\nEven though there have been plans to make an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradict the constitution. Plus, I believe this would be one of the rare amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government, which doesn't seem right at all.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government shouldn't be involved in this issue. I don't understand why the President is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It's evident that his push for this amendment shows he has a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the President or anyone in government, and there's no real reason behind this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else, and if anything, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've covered all my points.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. \n\nTo be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. Before going to war, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though the two weren't directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and that's just heartbreaking.\n\nWhat they did was remove the country's government, but I don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. They're trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. However, it's not an easy process, and the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal.\n\nIn Vietnam, they were trying to push out Communists and implement democracy, but it wasn't a clear-cut victory. There are always going to be insurgents, and fighting citizens is much harder than fighting an actual army. The US government didn't seem to be prepared for this, and now we're still there, dealing with the aftermath.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes, and I think the government didn't do that in this case. They weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there, with many American troops dying and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take over.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. But it's not that easy to implement a new form of government, and it takes years to make it successful. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, that's my take on the war in Iraq. It's a difficult decision to make, and once you're in, it's hard to leave. We've been there for so long, and we've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them now? It's a tough call, but there's also the issue of the high number of American casualties and how much more is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nGoing back to the reasons for invading Iraq, it's interesting that we're only doing this to Iraq and not other countries. I think it's all about oil and controlling resources. Another reason for the war was the claim of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which actually have those weapons, are not being targeted. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or truthful enough in their decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. But it's probably not going to be that simple.",
            "Honestly, I'm really in favor of gay marriage. I've been supportive for a long time now. I think it's entirely a personal preference and scientific evidence suggests that it can be biologically influenced rather than just a result of social conditioning. Therefore, depriving people of rights because of something they can't control is just inhumane to me.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think politics and government should have a say in this matter. It's a personal issue, a household decision, not something that should be addressed at a state or federal level. In my neighborhood back home, I've seen openly gay couples living together, just like any other families. They do the same things, take their dogs for a walk, and live their lives normally.\n\nI find it ridiculous that President Bush is trying to interpret the meaning of marriage and impose his own views on it. I think it's a personal choice that should be respected.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that research suggests there may be a chemical aspect to being homosexual, something people are predisposed to due to biology rather than environmental factors. For instance, someone growing up with four sisters and no father may not necessarily have anything to do with their sexual orientation.\n\nAs for the issue of marriage, I think it's weird that if a heterosexual couple can get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I believe it should be a private, personal decision, not something the government or national media should be involved in.",
            "Honestly, when you share something online, it becomes a public platform. It's completely out in the open. You can't take back what you've posted - it's there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Whatever you put online will influence people's opinions about you, and if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably report it. You can't just share something like that, because it'll be seen by everyone.\n\nThe internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on social media, you'll likely see their posts. It's not the school that's accessing this information; it's someone who's already connected to you. The school has to take this seriously, as they can't just ignore a potential threat. They might have prevented something terrible from happening if they'd acted sooner.\n\nOf course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, as some people just joke around online. Like that time in our school when it turned out to be a sociology experiment gone wrong. It could be a joke, or it could be a serious threat. In this case, something was overheard at school, and when we found out who said it, we looked into their online profiles and found some concerning posts that might have been meant as a joke but became serious in the context.\n\nWhen you post something online, there's no invasion of privacy - you're putting it out there for everyone to see. If you don't want it shared, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, don't tell them. You can't control how people interpret your online content.\n\nI don't think it's right for school officials to friend their students on social media and monitor their online activity. However, if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's something that's been shared publicly and might pose a threat, they can't just ignore it.\n\nIt's not the school's place to snoop on students' private lives, but if they're brought to their attention, they have to act. For instance, a teacher shouldn't create a fake social media account to keep an eye on their students - that's just crossing a line.\n\nI wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I definitely don't want to see their photos or updates. That's not my job as an R.A. I just want to focus on maintaining a good relationship with them, not monitoring their online activity.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the purpose behind it seemed good - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting just to prove that we're a powerful nation. I question whether the original motives were even pure, given George Bush's father's complicated history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our intention was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair system, that would've been a noble cause. But I think we accomplished that in the first few months of the war. It was a strong statement that spoke for itself. The fact that the conflict has been ongoing for over a year or more is just too prolonged.\n\nI believe that if our original purpose was to free a country from tyranny, that's a just cause for war. However, I think our reasons have been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. We don't want to exit without a decisive victory, but I think that time has come. Their government will eventually have to fend for themselves, and it's time for us to stop draining our economy by spending billions on a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war is staggering, and war shouldn't be a long-term expense. We have our own problems to address, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare, which could be greatly improved with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's sad to see our citizens being killed in a foreign country for a cause we've lost sight of.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm curious about something - isn't it true that a situation was prevented because someone looked through a student's online profile?\n\nApparently, someone searching through online profiles stumbled upon some information and was able to stop something from happening. This got me thinking - I mean, if you post stuff online, you've basically made it available for everyone to see. Websites like Myspace have privacy settings, but if you let someone be your friend, it's like you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that when you put things online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see them. And if someone's able to see that information and prevent a situation from escalating, that's a good thing. Of course, I can see how it'd be tough for one person to monitor everyone's profiles all the time. It's a tough call - do you have someone dedicated to looking through profiles or does that become a form of discrimination?\n\nI don't think it's right for someone to have a job just to monitor people's online activity, but I suppose it depends on the situation. Were they looking for specific information or were they just browsing through? It's a tricky issue - you want to be able to communicate with friends, but at the same time, you don't know who's actually looking at your stuff.\n\nI've got a Facebook account, but I've had some creepy experiences with people messing around with my info. I watched a documentary about a guy who was able to get a girl's screen name and arrange a meeting with her in just a few minutes. It's scary when you think about how much information is out there - people can see your interests, your schedule, your friends... and it's hard to know who's actually looking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I put on my Facebook, but it's a delicate balance - you want to be able to connect with friends without giving too much away. I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking. I've heard of schools banning students from having Myspace accounts, which seems strange - don't they have a right to decide what they put online? It's a complicated issue, and I'm not sure what the solution is.",
            "I'm going to touch on something I've been meaning to discuss - the Iraq War. To be honest, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it because I don't want to be part of the crowd that was against it from the start. However, it's not really relevant anymore since the general consensus worldwide is that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration, which refuses to admit their mistake. If you look at recent polls, it's clear that around 75-80% of the global population thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the US troops stationed there believe it was a poor decision and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure how to put it, but it's been a complete disaster from the start. The conflict was already chaotic, and now pulling out will also be a challenge. The truth is, there's no easy way to navigate the Middle East. I think it's because of the massive cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states, which administrations often struggle to understand. They try to impose democracy, but that's not how other cultures choose to govern themselves. Of course, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a disaster. I genuinely don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't see why we can't leave now. It's striking that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter believe we should leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinion shouldn't be ignored. If we asked them if we should leave and they said yes, it would at least take the blame off us if things go wrong. If we decide to help after that, we might at least be seen as the good guys, even if it's not entirely true.",
            "To be honest, I genuinely believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. It's not just a woman's issue, though - it's also about the specific field of work involved. Overall, I think women face more obstacles because of the \"glass ceiling\" that still exists, even with the promise of equality. Many people struggle to accept women in leadership positions, mainly due to the way society has been raised for so long. This leads to women being overlooked for promotions, even when they're perfectly qualified, simply because they're not traditionally seen as \"upper management material.\"\n\nIt's the same with other industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. People often look down on men who choose to stay at home and care for their children, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be really tough on them, especially if it's their dream to be with their kids and support their family.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it can be tough for men who are serious about their work to be taken seriously, just because they don't fit the traditional mold. People might wonder if they truly understand fashion, simply because they're men. Depending on the field of work, I believe there's definitely gender discrimination in society.\n\nChanging this mindset is difficult because society has a set way of thinking, and we've come a long way since the 1800s. However, progress is slow. But, as women continue to break through into higher positions and become CEOs, and as more men become stay-at-home dads, people are starting to accept these roles more. It's a slow process, but it's happening. People are starting to see that women can be successful in business and that men can be amazing caregivers. To promote this change, we need to highlight the qualities of individuals, rather than forcing it upon people. If we push too hard, people will resist. We need to be at a good balance, where it becomes normalized. I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do right now that hasn't already been done, but I do know that change takes time.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other factors, like where you're from or your background, can lead to discrimination. For example, someone from a rural area with a less polished education might face prejudice from those who emphasize formal education. This can be seen in all sorts of industries, where people often look down on others for not meeting certain standards. It's another example of how complex and multifaceted this issue is.",
            "I think they've taken marijuana from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people won't have to go through the hassle of being arrested and brought to court, which can be a big relief for those involved. However, it's worth noting that even with decriminalization, the long-term effects on a person's record can still be significant, making it harder to get jobs or secure other opportunities. On the other hand, one of the main arguments for decriminalization is that it saves a lot of money for the local government, as it eliminates the need for costly arrests, court appearances, and public defenders.\n\nIn places where people are more open-minded, like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a good move, allowing for more funds to be allocated to important causes like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. While it's true that marijuana shouldn't be completely legal, allowing it to be bought and sold like cigarettes, as it could lead to problems like people smoking and driving, I think the benefits of decriminalization outweigh the drawbacks. Of course, there are valid concerns about the potential negative effects of marijuana on people's lifestyles, but it's also worth noting that it affects different people in different ways, and some are more prone to overuse or addiction.\n\nUltimately, substances like marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to them. Some people can handle them fine, while others may struggle. I think it's essential to approach this issue with a nuanced perspective, recognizing both the potential benefits and drawbacks of decriminalization.",
            "I would say yes, because many traditional practices are rooted in their history and culture. They've done things a certain way for a long time, and it's good to maintain that connection to their heritage. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. \n\nFor instance, the Catholic Church expects its followers to attend church every week and adhere to specific rules. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on individuals who don't strictly follow the doctrine, and they don't accept people who don't fit the mold of a 'perfect' Catholic. They also don't accept people from other faiths. For example, my parents' marriage wasn't recognized by the Catholic Church because my dad was an Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance is hypocritical, considering their teaching to love others. It's contradictory to say we should love others while not accepting them.\n\nI think this outdated mindset is a major issue within the Catholic Church. They stick to their traditional practices, even if they go against their teachings. I'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would prevent pedophilic behavior, as it's a more complex issue. People who would harm children would likely do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different context altogether.\n\nUltimately, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a significant deterrent in preventing such incidents. It would likely happen regardless of their marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're facing today. The thin line between separating church and state and defining marriage is a complicated one that's hard to navigate without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm not sure where I stand, but I think all civil unions should be viewed the same way by the government, regardless of whether they're considered a sacrament. If two people are in a committed relationship, they should be treated equally, with or without tax benefits or government recognition. It's essentially a civil union between two people, and that's what it should be viewed as.\n\nIf every state can come to a logical conclusion, they should push for a federal law that reflects that. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a significant issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a vital enough cause to alter the constitution, just to define or ban gay marriage. It's as simple as that.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a mixed view on the topic of homosexuality since I was raised in a Christian household. I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it a bit confusing for me. While I don't fully agree with that lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something that should be decided by each state individually, rather than by the president.\n\nI figure that since a lot of states are democratic, they'll naturally support gay marriage, while republican states will be against it. If you live in a state that's decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, since you chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI've already kind of answered that, but basically, I don't think President Bush should be able to dictate whether the whole country should ban gay marriage. It should be up to individual states to decide whether or not to legalize it.\n\nI just don't think it's fair for Bush to decide how every state should run itself, since he doesn't live in every state. It's only for a couple of years until he's out of office, and even if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. I think it's better to leave it up to each individual state, since they'll have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nI don't think so, but I think states should have the freedom to make their own decisions without federal interference.",
            "Honestly, I don't agree with that perspective at all. Let me break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and anything you post on it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. In my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent potential school shootings, they have every right to do so because it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students.\n\nThink about it - even if students post under a pseudonym, school officials could still find out their identity through their home IP address or other means. It's not like they're doing anything wrong by monitoring the internet to prevent harm. If they discover students posting about dangerous activities, they're not being invasive; they're just doing their job to keep the school safe.\n\nIt's like when schools conduct lockdown drills to prepare for potential terrorist attacks. They're taking steps to ensure everyone's safety, and that's what school officials were doing in this case. They were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, which could have disastrous consequences. So, while it might seem like an invasion of privacy, I don't think it's unreasonable for them to monitor Myspace if it helps keep the school safe.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in today's digital age, once something is online, it's there forever. You can't just delete it and expect it to disappear. That's why I'm careful about what I post online, even in private messages or emails. You never know who might see it and how it could come back to haunt you.\n\nIn conclusion, while I don't think it's ideal for school officials to monitor Myspace, I understand their motivations. If they're doing it to prevent harm and keep the school safe, I think that's a reasonable approach. However, I do think they should focus on specific concerns rather than broadly monitoring the internet for any potential issues.",
            "Honestly, I've been thinking a lot about the war, and it's given me a lot to consider. At first, I was all for it because nine eleven affected me personally, and I felt like we had to do something in response. I was caught up in the emotional reaction, and I think that led me to overlook some of the potential consequences. Looking back, I realize that we rushed into it without a clear plan, and it's had some serious repercussions.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if I'd call myself for or against the war anymore. I think we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the long-term implications. It's clear that the people in Iraq are more concerned with fighting each other than with us, so I'm not convinced that our presence is making a difference.\n\nTo be honest, the more I learn about the war, the less I care about what's going on in Iraq. I think they're a very different people when it comes to war, and I'm not sure we're equipped to change their ways. It seems like they're more focused on getting rid of us than on improving their own country. I'm not sure that's something we can force them to change.\n\nI also think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge after nine eleven, rather than a rational analysis of the situation. We were more hyped up than thoughtful, and that's led to a lot of problems.\n\nIn hindsight, I think President Bush made a bold move by declaring war on Iraq, but I can understand why he felt it was necessary. At the time, it seemed like we had no choice but to act. However, I do think we could have planned our approach better and been clearer about what we hoped to achieve.\n\nOne thing that's become clear to me is that we're not equipped to change the people of Iraq. They're a complex and deeply divided society, and I'm not sure we can impose our will on them. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the cost and the effort. I think it's time for us to pull out and let them take care of their own problems.\n\nUltimately, I don't think we're doing ourselves any favors by staying in Iraq. We're just delaying the inevitable, and when we leave, the situation will likely collapse. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not, but I do think we should have a clear exit strategy and not just stay there indefinitely."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To be honest, I think the Catholic Church needs to adapt to some changes. I believe a lot of people are losing faith in the Church because it's not very accepting of certain things. For instance, its views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control seem a bit outdated. I get that the Church has strong opinions on these issues, but maybe if it adopted a more modern perspective, it wouldn't be losing followers. \n\nI've heard that many people are turning away from the Church due to its stance on these topics. They feel that the Church's views are outdated and that it's not considering the opinions of others. If the Church doesn't change its views, I think it'll continue to lose followers.\n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion might be a major reason why some people can't relate to it. If you personally believe in a woman's right to choose, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that teaches abortion is wrong. The same goes for gay marriage – if you support it, you might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share your views.\n\nI also think the Church's stance on female priests and married priests is outdated. I don't see why women can't be priests or why priests can't have families. The Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith, but that's not how the rest of the world works. Most people have careers and families, so why can't priests have both?\n\nIt's hard to say whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past issues, but it's worth considering. The Church's views on these topics might be a major reason why it's losing followers, and it's time for it to adapt to a more modern perspective.",
            "Honestly, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I think that people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. I don't think it's fair to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. [It just doesn't seem right.]\n\nI think that people don't have control over their sexual orientation, just like I didn't choose to be straight. It's not a conscious choice, and they shouldn't be judged for it. [It's not something they can control.]\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue, as it's not really a legal or moral concern. It's just a matter of respecting people's choices and who they are. I don't think they should be treated like they've made a mistake or wrong choice. [It's just not fair.]\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because it's none of their business. It's not a matter of national security or morality; they're just not relevant to the issue. [It's just not their place to interfere.] People's sexual orientation is who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. Period.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I strongly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason is that there's no valid argument against it. Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The concept of gay relationships is fundamentally different from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to compare the two directly. It's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nOne of the key issues is the lack of civil rights for gay couples. For instance, partners in a gay relationship may not be allowed to visit each other in the hospital or make medical decisions for one another, simply because the law doesn't recognize their relationship as \"family.\" This is unfair, especially considering that gay couples face the same challenges and have the same rates of success in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe main reason for the opposition to gay marriage seems to be a misunderstanding of what it means to be gay. Gay couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a legal document that confirms their union. This is a civil issue, not a religious one. If a civil union is granted, why not call it a marriage?\n\nThe comparison to segregation is apt - separate but unequal is still unequal. Gay couples are not asking for special treatment, but for equal rights. They face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about the impact on children.\n\nSome people worry about the children of gay couples, but this is a complex issue. While it's difficult to predict how children will adjust to society, it's clear that parenting skills are not determined by the parents' sexual orientation. In fact, gay couples can be just as involved in their community as heterosexual couples.\n\nIt's time for the federal government to take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is misguided and hypocritical, especially considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" pledge in the Pledge of Allegiance. It's time to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose one group's moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage because they believe that being gay is a result of psychological damage or a personality defect. However, this is not supported by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against this notion, and it's time for people to listen to credible research rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "So, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and I've got a pretty clear view on this. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't necessarily mean it has no benefits. I'm not saying we should make it widely available to the public, no way, that's not what I'm saying. But using it for medicinal purposes? Yeah, I think that's a different story. The thing is, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. I'm talking about stuff like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets – those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have genuine benefits. And if we can acknowledge the benefits of those drugs, why can't we do the same for marijuana? I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, by the way. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, but so can alcohol. It's a tough one, I know. I think we should consider making it legal gradually, but not all at once. That way, people can use it responsibly. The problem is, people have this bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not as bad as some other substances out there. If we could get rid of that image and show people that it's not a terrible thing, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly. And that would be a good thing, especially for medical purposes.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be when I was younger. I used to go to church every Sunday and wear matching outfits, including dresses, shoes, and a purse. It was a big deal for me back then, especially since I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. However, things have changed. They now have a 30-minute teenager mass, which is a more relaxed version of the traditional Sunday mass. People dress more casually, especially during summer, and even families who are running late show up in beach clothes. I've also noticed a shift in dress code for morning masses, where people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. It's become much more casual.\n\nAs for other changes, the church I know has become more relaxed. I'm not sure about the politics behind it, but that's how it seems to me. I don't think that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the accusations of pedophilia. Some people who are married still become pedophiles, and it's not because they're allowed to get married or not. It's a personal choice, and their attraction to young kids doesn't change just because of a marital status. I also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their own decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nI've seen examples of other religions where priests are allowed to get married, like in the Seventh Heaven faith, where the reverend or minister can be married. While it's a different situation, it shows that it's possible for someone to practice their faith and be married at the same time. I don't think the church could have prevented these accusations by changing its rules on marriage or ordination.\n\nMy opinion is that pedophilia is based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed by upbringing or environment. While it might play a small role in some cases, I believe it's primarily genetic. You can't hide someone's true nature, and it will usually come out eventually. If the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's a different story, and they should be ashamed. However, I don't think they were aware of everything that was happening.\n\nThat's my take on the situation. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church at this point.",
            "I have to admit, initially, I was okay with the idea, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks heavily influenced the US decision to invade Iraq. It seemed that the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs – claims that have since been proven false. This really got under my skin, and the Iraq war is a constant source of frustration for me.\n\nIt's hard to ignore the fact that the Bush administration repeatedly misled the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence to the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a serious abuse of power, and I believe it's an impeachable offense to lie to the public like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the US Constitution is also concerning, especially considering their actions since 9/11. It seems they wanted to go to war from the start, and I'm not convinced it was solely about national security.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I believe the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, driven by his father's administration. Expanding the US energy supply was also a likely motive, which is a pretty underhanded way to achieve it.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, withdrawing troops now would likely lead to chaos and more deaths. The alternative is a coalition of surrounding nations trying to restore order, but I'm not convinced this is the best solution either. The issue of Iraqi sovereignty will become a major problem, and the interim government's ineffectiveness is clear.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news, the Parliament is struggling to exert control, and the Prime Minister's influence is limited. Radical elements like Mugtada al-Sadr's party are still vying for power, causing friction in the government. It's a complex situation, and I'm not sure what the long-term consequences will be.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out my thoughts on the War in Iraq... I guess my initial reaction is that it all seems a bit pointless since it wasn't even a declared war in the first place. I feel like it was more of a response to Iraq's alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks, so it's hard for me to get excited about it. I don't really follow the details closely, but from what I understand, our main goal is to establish democracy in Iraq and secure access to their oil resources. However, this strategy seems to be causing more problems than it's solving. If we stay, we risk creating a long-term presence that will be difficult to withdraw from, and if we leave, we'll be seen as abandoning a country we've destabilized. I'm also worried that our attempts to impose democracy will only lead to resentment and a deeper divide between Iraq and the US.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I have a clear stance on the issue, which is probably why I'm struggling to articulate my thoughts. The more I think about it, the more complicated it seems. I guess one thing that does bother me is that we're using military force to assert our power and influence, rather than genuinely working towards a peaceful resolution. I'm not sure if declaring it a war was ever the right approach, considering it wasn't officially sanctioned by Congress.\n\nAt the same time, I do think there are families of soldiers who are affected by the conflict, and it's hard to want the war to end for their sake. However, our presence in Iraq is causing so much suffering and division, and I worry that our efforts to impose our values will only lead to more problems in the long run. Ultimately, I feel like the situation is a complex, messy, and deeply contentious issue that will likely continue for years to come.",
            "Honestly, I don't think it's right for a state or the government to make it legal or declare it legal. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, especially since the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty straightforward and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been written in the constitution.\n\nWhen it comes to people trying to make it illegal, I think that's essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. We see how most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution that allows for religious tolerance in the US.\n\nEven though there have been plans to make an amendment, I think that would be completely wrong and contradict the constitution. Plus, I believe this would be one of the rare amendments that actually restricts people rather than the government, which doesn't seem right at all.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government or any government shouldn't be involved in this issue. I don't understand why the President is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. It's evident that his push for this amendment shows he has a preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide, not the President or anyone in government, and there's no real reason behind this amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or anything else, and if anything, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've covered all my points.",
            "Okay, let's talk about the war in Iraq. \n\nTo be honest, I think the government wasn't entirely transparent with the American people about the reasons behind the invasion. Before going to war, I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though the two weren't directly related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, using their outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. A huge number of American soldiers have died, and that's just heartbreaking.\n\nWhat they did was remove the country's government, but I don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. They're trying to implement a democratic government, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. However, it's not an easy process, and the US government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal.\n\nIn Vietnam, they were trying to push out Communists and implement democracy, but it wasn't a clear-cut victory. There are always going to be insurgents, and fighting citizens is much harder than fighting an actual army. The US government didn't seem to be prepared for this, and now we're still there, dealing with the aftermath.\n\nIf you're going to go to war, you need to plan for all possible outcomes, and I think the government didn't do that in this case. They weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there, with many American troops dying and trying to train the Iraqi troops and police forces to take over.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. But it's not that easy to implement a new form of government, and it takes years to make it successful. In our own country, democracy was a long struggle, with lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, that's my take on the war in Iraq. It's a difficult decision to make, and once you're in, it's hard to leave. We've been there for so long, and we've taken away their government and way of life, so how can we just abandon them now? It's a tough call, but there's also the issue of the high number of American casualties and how much more is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nGoing back to the reasons for invading Iraq, it's interesting that we're only doing this to Iraq and not other countries. I think it's all about oil and controlling resources. Another reason for the war was the claim of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which actually have those weapons, are not being targeted. It seems like the US government is not being thorough or truthful enough in their decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq soon. But it's probably not going to be that simple.",
            "Honestly, I'm really in favor of gay marriage. I've been supportive for a long time now. I think it's entirely a personal preference and scientific evidence suggests that it can be biologically influenced rather than just a result of social conditioning. Therefore, depriving people of rights because of something they can't control is just inhumane to me.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think politics and government should have a say in this matter. It's a personal issue, a household decision, not something that should be addressed at a state or federal level. In my neighborhood back home, I've seen openly gay couples living together, just like any other families. They do the same things, take their dogs for a walk, and live their lives normally.\n\nI find it ridiculous that President Bush is trying to interpret the meaning of marriage and impose his own views on it. I think it's a personal choice that should be respected.\n\nI've read and heard from various sources that research suggests there may be a chemical aspect to being homosexual, something people are predisposed to due to biology rather than environmental factors. For instance, someone growing up with four sisters and no father may not necessarily have anything to do with their sexual orientation.\n\nAs for the issue of marriage, I think it's weird that if a heterosexual couple can get married without anyone knowing, but if two gay people want to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I believe it should be a private, personal decision, not something the government or national media should be involved in.",
            "Honestly, when you share something online, it becomes a public platform. It's completely out in the open. You can't take back what you've posted - it's there for everyone to see. As an R.A., I've actually dealt with this issue before. Whatever you put online will influence people's opinions about you, and if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, someone will inevitably report it. You can't just share something like that, because it'll be seen by everyone.\n\nThe internet is a global platform, and if you're friends with someone on social media, you'll likely see their posts. It's not the school that's accessing this information; it's someone who's already connected to you. The school has to take this seriously, as they can't just ignore a potential threat. They might have prevented something terrible from happening if they'd acted sooner.\n\nOf course, it's hard to know what to take seriously, as some people just joke around online. Like that time in our school when it turned out to be a sociology experiment gone wrong. It could be a joke, or it could be a serious threat. In this case, something was overheard at school, and when we found out who said it, we looked into their online profiles and found some concerning posts that might have been meant as a joke but became serious in the context.\n\nWhen you post something online, there's no invasion of privacy - you're putting it out there for everyone to see. If you don't want it shared, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, don't tell them. You can't control how people interpret your online content.\n\nI don't think it's right for school officials to friend their students on social media and monitor their online activity. However, if something's brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. If it's something that's been shared publicly and might pose a threat, they can't just ignore it.\n\nIt's not the school's place to snoop on students' private lives, but if they're brought to their attention, they have to act. For instance, a teacher shouldn't create a fake social media account to keep an eye on their students - that's just crossing a line.\n\nI wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to know about their personal lives, and I definitely don't want to see their photos or updates. That's not my job as an R.A. I just want to focus on maintaining a good relationship with them, not monitoring their online activity.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the purpose behind it seemed good - to restore democracy in another country. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that goal and are now fighting just to prove that we're a powerful nation. I question whether the original motives were even pure, given George Bush's father's complicated history with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our intention was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair system, that would've been a noble cause. But I think we accomplished that in the first few months of the war. It was a strong statement that spoke for itself. The fact that the conflict has been ongoing for over a year or more is just too prolonged.\n\nI believe that if our original purpose was to free a country from tyranny, that's a just cause for war. However, I think our reasons have been distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. We don't want to exit without a decisive victory, but I think that time has come. Their government will eventually have to fend for themselves, and it's time for us to stop draining our economy by spending billions on a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war is staggering, and war shouldn't be a long-term expense. We have our own problems to address, like poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare, which could be greatly improved with the money we're spending on this conflict. It's sad to see our citizens being killed in a foreign country for a cause we've lost sight of.\n\nThat's my two cents on the matter.",
            "I'm curious about something - isn't it true that a situation was prevented because someone looked through a student's online profile?\n\nApparently, someone searching through online profiles stumbled upon some information and was able to stop something from happening. This got me thinking - I mean, if you post stuff online, you've basically made it available for everyone to see. Websites like Myspace have privacy settings, but if you let someone be your friend, it's like you're giving them permission to see your stuff.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that when you put things online, you have to be aware that lots of people might see them. And if someone's able to see that information and prevent a situation from escalating, that's a good thing. Of course, I can see how it'd be tough for one person to monitor everyone's profiles all the time. It's a tough call - do you have someone dedicated to looking through profiles or does that become a form of discrimination?\n\nI don't think it's right for someone to have a job just to monitor people's online activity, but I suppose it depends on the situation. Were they looking for specific information or were they just browsing through? It's a tricky issue - you want to be able to communicate with friends, but at the same time, you don't know who's actually looking at your stuff.\n\nI've got a Facebook account, but I've had some creepy experiences with people messing around with my info. I watched a documentary about a guy who was able to get a girl's screen name and arrange a meeting with her in just a few minutes. It's scary when you think about how much information is out there - people can see your interests, your schedule, your friends... and it's hard to know who's actually looking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I put on my Facebook, but it's a delicate balance - you want to be able to connect with friends without giving too much away. I only accept people I know as friends, but you never know who might be looking. I've heard of schools banning students from having Myspace accounts, which seems strange - don't they have a right to decide what they put online? It's a complicated issue, and I'm not sure what the solution is.",
            "I'm going to touch on something I've been meaning to discuss - the Iraq War. To be honest, I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it because I don't want to be part of the crowd that was against it from the start. However, it's not really relevant anymore since the general consensus worldwide is that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration, which refuses to admit their mistake. If you look at recent polls, it's clear that around 75-80% of the global population thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of the US troops stationed there believe it was a poor decision and that we should withdraw within a year. I'm not sure how to put it, but it's been a complete disaster from the start. The conflict was already chaotic, and now pulling out will also be a challenge. The truth is, there's no easy way to navigate the Middle East. I think it's because of the massive cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states, which administrations often struggle to understand. They try to impose democracy, but that's not how other cultures choose to govern themselves. Of course, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to turn into a disaster. I genuinely don't see a reason to stay in Iraq any longer. I'm sure the administration has some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to justify our presence. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a problem with that. However, I don't see why we can't leave now. It's striking that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and at least a quarter believe we should leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and their opinion shouldn't be ignored. If we asked them if we should leave and they said yes, it would at least take the blame off us if things go wrong. If we decide to help after that, we might at least be seen as the good guys, even if it's not entirely true.",
            "To be honest, I genuinely believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. It's not just a woman's issue, though - it's also about the specific field of work involved. Overall, I think women face more obstacles because of the \"glass ceiling\" that still exists, even with the promise of equality. Many people struggle to accept women in leadership positions, mainly due to the way society has been raised for so long. This leads to women being overlooked for promotions, even when they're perfectly qualified, simply because they're not traditionally seen as \"upper management material.\"\n\nIt's the same with other industries, like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. People often look down on men who choose to stay at home and care for their children, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be really tough on them, especially if it's their dream to be with their kids and support their family.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it can be tough for men who are serious about their work to be taken seriously, just because they don't fit the traditional mold. People might wonder if they truly understand fashion, simply because they're men. Depending on the field of work, I believe there's definitely gender discrimination in society.\n\nChanging this mindset is difficult because society has a set way of thinking, and we've come a long way since the 1800s. However, progress is slow. But, as women continue to break through into higher positions and become CEOs, and as more men become stay-at-home dads, people are starting to accept these roles more. It's a slow process, but it's happening. People are starting to see that women can be successful in business and that men can be amazing caregivers. To promote this change, we need to highlight the qualities of individuals, rather than forcing it upon people. If we push too hard, people will resist. We need to be at a good balance, where it becomes normalized. I'm not sure if there's anything more we can do right now that hasn't already been done, but I do know that change takes time.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other factors, like where you're from or your background, can lead to discrimination. For example, someone from a rural area with a less polished education might face prejudice from those who emphasize formal education. This can be seen in all sorts of industries, where people often look down on others for not meeting certain standards. It's another example of how complex and multifaceted this issue is.",
            "I think they've taken marijuana from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. This means that people won't have to go through the hassle of being arrested and brought to court, which can be a big relief for those involved. However, it's worth noting that even with decriminalization, the long-term effects on a person's record can still be significant, making it harder to get jobs or secure other opportunities. On the other hand, one of the main arguments for decriminalization is that it saves a lot of money for the local government, as it eliminates the need for costly arrests, court appearances, and public defenders.\n\nIn places where people are more open-minded, like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a good move, allowing for more funds to be allocated to important causes like education, social programs, and helping the homeless. While it's true that marijuana shouldn't be completely legal, allowing it to be bought and sold like cigarettes, as it could lead to problems like people smoking and driving, I think the benefits of decriminalization outweigh the drawbacks. Of course, there are valid concerns about the potential negative effects of marijuana on people's lifestyles, but it's also worth noting that it affects different people in different ways, and some are more prone to overuse or addiction.\n\nUltimately, substances like marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's hard to generalize how people will react to them. Some people can handle them fine, while others may struggle. I think it's essential to approach this issue with a nuanced perspective, recognizing both the potential benefits and drawbacks of decriminalization.",
            "I would say yes, because many traditional practices are rooted in their history and culture. They've done things a certain way for a long time, and it's good to maintain that connection to their heritage. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. \n\nFor instance, the Catholic Church expects its followers to attend church every week and adhere to specific rules. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on individuals who don't strictly follow the doctrine, and they don't accept people who don't fit the mold of a 'perfect' Catholic. They also don't accept people from other faiths. For example, my parents' marriage wasn't recognized by the Catholic Church because my dad was an Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance is hypocritical, considering their teaching to love others. It's contradictory to say we should love others while not accepting them.\n\nI think this outdated mindset is a major issue within the Catholic Church. They stick to their traditional practices, even if they go against their teachings. I'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would prevent pedophilic behavior, as it's a more complex issue. People who would harm children would likely do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different context altogether.\n\nUltimately, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a significant deterrent in preventing such incidents. It would likely happen regardless of their marital status.",
            "Honestly, I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the trickiest topics we're facing today. The thin line between separating church and state and defining marriage is a complicated one that's hard to navigate without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm not sure where I stand, but I think all civil unions should be viewed the same way by the government, regardless of whether they're considered a sacrament. If two people are in a committed relationship, they should be treated equally, with or without tax benefits or government recognition. It's essentially a civil union between two people, and that's what it should be viewed as.\n\nIf every state can come to a logical conclusion, they should push for a federal law that reflects that. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a significant issue for some people, but it's not big enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a vital enough cause to alter the constitution, just to define or ban gay marriage. It's as simple as that.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a mixed view on the topic of homosexuality since I was raised in a Christian household. I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it a bit confusing for me. While I don't fully agree with that lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue, but rather something that should be decided by each state individually, rather than by the president.\n\nI figure that since a lot of states are democratic, they'll naturally support gay marriage, while republican states will be against it. If you live in a state that's decided to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with that decision, since you chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, which is why I think it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI've already kind of answered that, but basically, I don't think President Bush should be able to dictate whether the whole country should ban gay marriage. It should be up to individual states to decide whether or not to legalize it.\n\nI just don't think it's fair for Bush to decide how every state should run itself, since he doesn't live in every state. It's only for a couple of years until he's out of office, and even if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. I think it's better to leave it up to each individual state, since they'll have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nI don't think so, but I think states should have the freedom to make their own decisions without federal interference.",
            "Honestly, I don't agree with that perspective at all. Let me break it down. Myspace is a public platform, and anything you post on it can be seen by anyone, including school officials. If you post something on the internet, you have to be aware that people will see it, whether it's school officials or not. In my opinion, if school officials are monitoring Myspace to prevent potential school shootings, they have every right to do so because it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students.\n\nThink about it - even if students post under a pseudonym, school officials could still find out their identity through their home IP address or other means. It's not like they're doing anything wrong by monitoring the internet to prevent harm. If they discover students posting about dangerous activities, they're not being invasive; they're just doing their job to keep the school safe.\n\nIt's like when schools conduct lockdown drills to prepare for potential terrorist attacks. They're taking steps to ensure everyone's safety, and that's what school officials were doing in this case. They were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting, which could have disastrous consequences. So, while it might seem like an invasion of privacy, I don't think it's unreasonable for them to monitor Myspace if it helps keep the school safe.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in today's digital age, once something is online, it's there forever. You can't just delete it and expect it to disappear. That's why I'm careful about what I post online, even in private messages or emails. You never know who might see it and how it could come back to haunt you.\n\nIn conclusion, while I don't think it's ideal for school officials to monitor Myspace, I understand their motivations. If they're doing it to prevent harm and keep the school safe, I think that's a reasonable approach. However, I do think they should focus on specific concerns rather than broadly monitoring the internet for any potential issues.",
            "Honestly, I've been thinking a lot about the war, and it's given me a lot to consider. At first, I was all for it because nine eleven affected me personally, and I felt like we had to do something in response. I was caught up in the emotional reaction, and I think that led me to overlook some of the potential consequences. Looking back, I realize that we rushed into it without a clear plan, and it's had some serious repercussions.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if I'd call myself for or against the war anymore. I think we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the long-term implications. It's clear that the people in Iraq are more concerned with fighting each other than with us, so I'm not convinced that our presence is making a difference.\n\nTo be honest, the more I learn about the war, the less I care about what's going on in Iraq. I think they're a very different people when it comes to war, and I'm not sure we're equipped to change their ways. It seems like they're more focused on getting rid of us than on improving their own country. I'm not sure that's something we can force them to change.\n\nI also think we were driven by emotions and a desire for revenge after nine eleven, rather than a rational analysis of the situation. We were more hyped up than thoughtful, and that's led to a lot of problems.\n\nIn hindsight, I think President Bush made a bold move by declaring war on Iraq, but I can understand why he felt it was necessary. At the time, it seemed like we had no choice but to act. However, I do think we could have planned our approach better and been clearer about what we hoped to achieve.\n\nOne thing that's become clear to me is that we're not equipped to change the people of Iraq. They're a complex and deeply divided society, and I'm not sure we can impose our will on them. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the cost and the effort. I think it's time for us to pull out and let them take care of their own problems.\n\nUltimately, I don't think we're doing ourselves any favors by staying in Iraq. We're just delaying the inevitable, and when we leave, the situation will likely collapse. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not, but I do think we should have a clear exit strategy and not just stay there indefinitely."
