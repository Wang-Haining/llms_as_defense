            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes to stay relevant.  I think one reason people are losing interest in the Church is because it isn't very open-minded when it comes to certain issues.  They have rigid views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are outdated in many ways.  If they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, I don't think they'd be worried about losing followers. \n\nI've heard many people are turning against the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues.  People are starting to disagree with them on these topics, and that's causing some to question the Church's views.  They feel the Church is out of touch with modern values.  For example, if you support abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that sees it as morally wrong.  Similarly, if you're in favor of gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that disapproves of it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or have priests who are married.  It's not clear if that would have prevented scandals like the ones we've seen, but it's an idea worth considering.  It's hard to say whether allowing married priests or women priests would have made a difference, but it's worth exploring.  It's worth noting that other jobs involve balancing work and personal life – why can't priests do the same?\n\nThe Church views priests as married to God, devoted to a life of service.  However, most people in the world have a job and a family life, and they manage to balance both.  So, I don't see why priests can't have both a career and a family.",
            "to be honest, i'm a bit hesitant to express my thoughts on the topic of gay marriage. let me just say that personally, i don't have an issue with it - i think people should be free to live their lives however they choose. it's not something that i think is a conscious choice, and if someone is born with a certain orientation, i don't think they should be held accountable for it. it doesn't sit right with me to think that a couple of the same sex shouldn't be allowed to get married just because of their orientation.\n\ni think the key thing is that people are born the way they are, whether they're straight, gay, or whatever. it's not something that can be changed, and i don't think it's fair to judge someone for it. so, in my opinion, it's just wrong to deny people the right to get married based on their orientation.\n\ni'm not sure if i've really given this topic much thought, but i think it's clear to me that it's not about making a choice, it's about being who you are. and i don't think the federal government should be involved in making decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nit's just not their place to dictate how people live their lives, especially when it's something as fundamental as who they can marry. it's not a matter of national security or morality, it's just a matter of letting people be themselves. and if that means a same-sex couple wants to get married, then that's their choice, not the government's.\n\nanyway, that's my two cents on the matter. i'm not sure if i've made myself clear, but i think it's pretty simple - people should be free to live their lives as they see fit, and the government should stay out of it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no valid reason not to. The argument that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is just not convincing, considering the complexity of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct entities that can't be reduced to simple opposition. The fact is, gay couples have the same fundamental rights as straight couples, including property rights and access to healthcare, which are essential for ensuring the well-being of all individuals.\n\nHowever, when it comes to healthcare, gay couples often face unique challenges. For instance, their partners may not be recognized as family members, even if they're in a long-term committed relationship, which can limit their access to care and support. This seems unreasonable, especially considering the importance of having a supportive partner during times of illness.\n\nResearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of forming stable and fulfilling relationships as straight couples. They share similar relationship dynamics, and their relationships are just as likely to succeed. The trouble is that many people are hung up on the idea that gay marriage is somehow against their religious beliefs or moral code. But if we're talking about a civil union, a legal document issued by the government, then what's the issue? It's not about church and state; it's about recognizing the rights of all citizens.\n\nThe concept of segregation, where certain groups are treated unequally, is a major concern here. It's similar to the old days of \"separate but equal,\" which we've learned is fundamentally unfair. Gay couples are not asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document that recognizes their commitment to each other.\n\nPeople worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and prejudices. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted as those raised by straight parents. The real issue is how society treats these children, not their parents' sexual orientation. In fact, many schools and communities are working to create inclusive environments for these children, acknowledging that they deserve the same love, support, and respect as any other child.\n\nThe federal government should take a more prominent role in ensuring that gay marriage is recognized and protected nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is a step in the wrong direction, as it would impose a narrow, religious-based view on the entire country. This would be hypocritical, considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" debate and the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, organizations like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based research over personal opinions and cultural norms. If we listened more to institutions that conduct rigorous studies and less to popular opinion, we might gain a more nuanced understanding of these issues.",
            "Alright, so here's the thing, I work at the hospital pharmacy over the summer, and let's be real, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it can't have some benefits. I'm saying no to making it available to the general public, no way, but using it for medicinal purposes? That's a different story. We use loads of controlled substances in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, and they're super beneficial. So, just because marijuana is taboo doesn't mean we should deny its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not like these other controlled substances, either. If you abuse marijuana, it's not the same as abusing alcohol, which can lead to serious issues. It's a tough call, but I think we should allow it gradually, not all at once, because that would just lead to overuse. We need to break down the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might start using it responsibly.\n\nThe issue is that people have this awful image of marijuana in their heads, which isn't entirely fair. It's not like heroin or cocaine; it's not that bad for you. If we can change that image, people might start using it for medical purposes, and who knows, responsibly.",
            "i think the church has made an effort to adapt to modern times, but it's still not the strict institution it used to be.  growing up, i was a regular at church every sunday, dressing up in cute outfits, matching shoes, and a purse.  it was part of my routine, especially since i attended a private school where i saw my friends every weekend.  but over time, the church has changed, introducing a teenager mass that's just 30 minutes long and allowing more casual attire, even for the morning masses.  during the summer, people often show up in beachwear, and families often rush in late.  it's become a more relaxed atmosphere, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of traditional church clothes.  while it's nice to see a more casual approach, it's still the church i know.  as for the church's internal politics, i'm not well-versed on the details, but that's my general observation.\n\nregarding the accusations of pedophilia within the catholic church, i think these issues could've been avoided regardless of the church's policies on female priests or married priests.  in my opinion, pedophilia is more of a personal issue, and it's the individual's choice to become a priest.  there are already married men who become pedophiles, so allowing them to get married wouldn't necessarily solve the problem.  i also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's a personal decision, and they should consider a faith that allows them to be married if that's what they want.\n\nto elaborate, i think pedophilia is more of a genetic issue than something someone develops due to their environment.  while upbringing might play a small role, i believe it's largely based on genetics.  you can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and it's unlikely they'll be able to hide their true nature.  if the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a different matter altogether.  however, i don't think they necessarily knew about every case.  overall, i don't have any other thoughts on the catholic church beyond this.",
            "I'll be honest, my initial take on the whole situation was quite acceptable, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and the invasion of Iraq was largely a pretext. I believe the Bush administration initially tried to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nTo be frank, the fact that the Bush administration has been so open about lying to the American people really gets my blood boiling. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's a huge red flag in my book – it's essentially malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense.\n\nIt seems to me that the administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution and tried to marginalize it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war, and I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration's issues with him. On top of that, Bush's true motives seemed to be expanding our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nFrankly, I think it's time to move on, but withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more casualties. The alternative, which the UN and US are considering, is to form a coalition with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It'll likely lead to more problems down the line, especially with Iraq's sovereignty being a major issue. The interim government is essentially falling apart, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the situation. Even Mugtada al-Sadr's party holds a significant amount of power, and we're still dealing with radical elements fighting for control. It's clear the political process is facing a lot of friction due to these factors.\n\nTo be blunt, I don't have any polite words for the whole situation.",
            "i've been wanting to discuss my thoughts about the war in iraq for a while now, but to be honest, it's a really complicated topic for me. i guess you could say i'm still trying to wrap my head around it. one thing that's been on my mind is that it's not even a declared war, which kinda makes it hard to understand our presence over there. i feel like it was more of a retaliatory measure after the 9/11 attacks, and we've been staying in iraq to try and establish a democracy, which sounds great on paper, but it's not that simple. we're also trying to secure oil resources, which isn't a very compelling reason to stay. the problem is, we're just making things worse for everyone involved. if we stay, we'll have to invest a lot of time and money in building a democracy, which is a long-term commitment, and if we leave, the iraqis will be left to pick up the pieces and deal with the aftermath. it's a tough situation, and to be honest, i don't feel like i have a clear answer.\n\ni've been thinking a lot about how we got into this situation and how we can get out of it. one thing that's been on my mind is that we never actually declared war in congress, so it's not even a 'real' war in the eyes of some people. i'm not sure what the point is in staying over there anymore, and it's making our country look bad in the eyes of the world. it's a bit like the vietnam war, which was also undeclared and is now seen as a pointless conflict. our president is getting a bad reputation because of it, and i feel bad for him, but ultimately, it's not just about him - it's about the people who are suffering in iraq.\n\ni know some people have family members fighting over there, and it's hard to say that i want the war to end when i know how much it affects them. but at the same time, i'm worried that our presence is causing more harm than good. we're trying to impose our way of life on the iraqis, which isn't going to work, and it's only going to make them more resentful towards us. the whole al-qaeda thing is just going to get worse, and our efforts to establish a democracy are going to be a long, drawn-out process. i think this conflict is going to drag on for years to come, and i'm not sure what the end result will be.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure if I should even be having this conversation. But here's my take on it: I don't think it's right for a state to make it legal or even declare it as legal. I believe that's a decision that should be left up to the churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of that.\n\nIn my opinion, the people pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think any attempt to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and go against what's already been written. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right at all.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. It seems to me that the president's push for this amendment is driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There's no solid reason behind this amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society.\n\nTo be honest, I've said most of what I want to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, so I'm thinking about the war in Iraq and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. In my opinion, there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they're not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people following the 9/11 attacks and used that to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of sorts of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the aftermath of the invasion. A huge number of American soldiers have died, which is absolutely heartbreaking, and the US government wasn't prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to establish a democratic one, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, but it's a much more complicated process than people initially thought. The government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal, and not a clear-cut victory. In Vietnam, the US fought against an actual army, but in Iraq, they're fighting against citizens, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency.\n\nI think the government made a mistake by going to war without planning for all possible outcomes, and they weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying, and the US is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police to secure their own country. It's a long process, and I think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful mission.\n\nWe shouldn't have underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government, and it's not an easy thing to do, as we can see from our own country's history. The government made it seem like a relatively easy task, but it's not. \n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was weighing my options, and one of my reasons for considering George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, now that we've been in Iraq for so long, it's hard to justify continuing the war, especially considering the number of American casualties. It's a difficult decision, and I think we should try to see it through, but we also need to consider the astronomical number of casualties and whether it's worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIt's also interesting that we're not taking similar actions in other countries, like North Korea, which has weapons of mass destruction, but we're not targeting them. I think the real reason for invading Iraq is the oil issue and controlling resources. Another reason was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, it probably won't be that straightforward.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where to start with this, but I guess I'll just dive right in: I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage. I've always been, and I'm not really sure why I need to explain it, but I suppose I do. I think it's a deeply personal preference and something that's increasingly being shown to have a biological component, rather than being solely a product of societal influences. This makes it even harder to justify denying people the rights they deserve just because of something they can't control.\n\nI've always believed that it's inhumane to withhold rights based on something that's beyond an individual's control. And, to be honest, I think it's rather hypocritical for politicians and the government to try to dictate what constitutes a marriage. Marriage is a personal, intimate relationship that affects individuals at a deeply personal level, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they live their lives just like any other family would - they walk their dogs, go about their daily routines, and contribute to their community in the same ways as everyone else.\n\nIt's just ridiculous that the politicians are trying to impose their own twisted interpretation of marriage on everyone else. Bush's attempt to redefine marriage is nothing short of absurd. I've read and heard from countless credible sources that there's a chemical aspect to being gay, a predisposition that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. This biologically-based aspect is vastly different from sociological factors that might influence someone's choices.\n\nTo me, the most obvious issue with gay marriage is that it's a private matter, not something that should be subject to public scrutiny or federal approval. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, and it won't make the headlines. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front-page news. I think that's a clear indication that we need to treat marriage as a private, personal issue, rather than a matter of public policy.",
            "Honestly, people often neglect the fact that anything posted online is now public domain. It's completely out in the open, and you can't retract it if you change your mind. As an RA, I've already dealt with this issue firsthand. When you share something, it can shape how others view you, and that's something to consider. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, someone's bound to react. You can't hide that information, and it's not something you can just keep to yourself.\n\nThe internet is a broad platform that everyone can access. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll likely see their bulletin. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in our case, but someone had access to it and shared it with the authorities. The school has a responsibility to act on potentially threatening situations to prevent harm.\n\nIt's difficult to know what to take seriously when some people post things as jokes or for a sociological experiment. We had a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's online presence was reviewed, and some of the content they had posted was perceived as serious, even though it might have been intended as a joke.\n\nWhen you post something online, you lose any expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, you shouldn't post it. You can't dictate what others think or take seriously. I don't think it's a good idea for school officials to have social media accounts and be friends with students. However, if something's brought to their attention, they can't ignore it if it poses a potential threat.\n\nI don't think schools should monitor phone conversations, texts, or IMs, but if a student reports a concern, it's a different story. As an RA, I don't even have a Facebook or Myspace account – I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives or see their photos online. It's not my place to know that information, and I certainly don't want the responsibility that comes with it.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At the beginning, the idea was to restore democracy in a country that was in dire need of it, but I think we've lost sight of that original purpose a long time ago. It seems like we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a superpower. \n\nI've always wondered if the motives behind the war were pure to begin with, especially considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If our goal was genuinely to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, that would be a noble cause – as long as it wasn't motivated by personal interests. But I believe that's not the case. The war has dragged on for over a year, and I think we've already made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a powerful statement in itself.\n\nHowever, the fact that it's been going on for years is just ridiculous. If our initial intention was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a just cause. But I think our reasons have been distorted and misconstrued over time. It seems like we're still fighting just for the sake of fighting, and we don't want to end the war without a clear victory. \n\nI truly believe it's time to bring this war to an end. Our government officials need to take responsibility for their own affairs, and I think that time has come. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal issues that need funding. I think it's a drain on our economy for a cause that's long since been lost.\n\nThe amount of money being spent is staggering – billions and billions of dollars that could be better spent on our own internal problems, like public roads, education, and healthcare. It's disheartening to think that some of our own citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost sight of its purpose. I think that's a tragedy.",
            "I had a question that I wanted to clarify, but I'm not sure where to start. It seems that someone was able to intervene in a situation because they found some information online that was quite revealing.\n\nHonestly, it's pretty much expected that when you post stuff online, especially on sites like Myspace, it's going to be out there for everyone to see. You have to be a member to view someone's profile, but that's because you've essentially given permission for others to see it when you accepted their friend request. So, anytime you put information online, you have to be aware that a lot of people might see it.\n\nI have to admit, in this case, I think it's a good thing that someone was able to see that information and prevent a potentially serious situation. However, I can see why it's tricky. It's not practical or fair to have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles just in case. It could be seen as discriminatory if they're only focusing on certain people.\n\nI'm not sure how it would work in practice, but it's all about context. Was someone just browsing randomly or were they actively looking for something specific? If it's the former, it's a bit creepy, but if it's the latter, then maybe it's not such a bad thing.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who could be seeing my information. I recall this one TV show where a guy demonstrated just how easy it is to get information online and use it to meet people. It's unnerving, to say the least. I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they can figure out who I am and contact me through instant messaging. It's a delicate balance between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends and classmates. It's a tough issue because you never know who might be looking at what. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned Myspace, and it seemed a bit strange. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complicated situation, and I'm still not entirely sure what to think about it.",
            "i'm having trouble talking about the Iraq War, to be honest, because I feel like I'm jumping on a bandwagon \nI'm hesitant to admit that I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore \nThe general consensus among people, except for those within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea, and I'm inclined to agree \nLooking at the polls - both in the US, Iraq, and globally - it's clear that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a mistake \nIn fact, even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year \nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the get-go, and it's becoming increasingly clear that pulling out won't be easy either \nI think it's because of the huge cultural divide between the US and the Middle East, and the fact that we're trying to impose democracy in a region where it may not be welcomed \nI mean, Saddam was without a doubt a bad guy, but you can't just invade a country without considering the potential consequences \nIt's like trying to impose Western values on a completely different culture \nI'm still not convinced that there's a good reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary \nI'm not sure I buy the administration's arguments for why we should stay, and I'm yet to hear a legitimate reason for extending our presence \nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now \nIt's clear that the Iraqi people would like us to leave, with around 80% wanting us out within a year and a quarter thinking we should leave immediately \nIt makes sense to me that they might know better than we do, and if we ask them and they say yes, then it's on them if things go wrong \nIf we leave, at least we can say we tried to do the right thing, even if it's not like we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East",
            "i think there's still a lot of gender discrimination going on in the US.  i'm not just talking about women, though - it's also about the specific job or field someone's in.  overall, i feel like women have it tougher because there's this concept of a 'glass ceiling' where they're supposed to be equal but in reality, people often have a hard time accepting a woman in charge, even when she's qualified for the job.  it's because of how society's been raised for so long - people are used to men being in charge.  so, women might see a job they're qualified for, but the board won't promote them because it's not common to see women in upper management.  the same thing happens to men in industries like fashion or childcare - it's not common for men to be the primary caregivers, and people look down on them for it.  they're seen as the breadwinners and it's weird if they stay home to take care of the kids.\n\nin fashion, it's even harder for men who are straight because people don't take them seriously.  it's like, if you're a man who's into fashion, people assume you're not really into it because it's not typically something men do.  they think you're just pretending to be like other guys who are into fashion.  it's the same with women in male-dominated fields - people assume they're not really good at it because they're women.\n\nit's hard to change this mindset because society is set in its ways.  we've made progress, but it's slow.  we've come a long way since the 1800s, but it's still a slow process.  women are getting into higher positions and becoming CEOs, which is a good start.  and it's also becoming more acceptable for men to be stay-at-home dads.  but we still have to promote the good qualities of people who are being stereotyped.  we can't just force it, because people will resist.  we're at a good point now where we're starting to see some changes, but it takes time.\n\nanother thing is that people are discriminated against based on where they're from, not just their gender.  like, if you grew up on a farm and you're not a great speaker, but you're super intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, people might look down on you because of your accent.  or if you're a man and you're not a good writer, people might think you're not smart because of that.  it's not just about gender, it's about where you come from and how you speak.",
            "So, I wanted to clarify how the law has changed on this issue. They've made some changes, apparently decriminalizing it, which means it's not as serious of an offense as it used to be. It's more like getting a traffic ticket, where you might get fined, but you won't be arrested and charged like before. Now, I know some people might worry about the future consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized - it can still impact things like job interviews and other opportunities. On the other hand, there's a argument that arresting people, prosecuting them, and putting them through the system is really expensive. When you think about it, it adds up - arresting, booking, housing them, and then going through the court process, just to let them go. Plus, there's the cost of appointing a public defender, paying the judge, and having the state attorney's office handle the case. It all adds up, and it's not a small expense.\n\nIn places that are struggling financially, some officials might not be willing to make this change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things. But in cities like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize marijuana. I think it's a good idea because it can free up funds for things like education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not just about making marijuana freely available; it's about the financial benefits and the potential to use that money for good.\n\nOf course, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available. Some people might worry that it would be too easily accessible, like cigarettes sold in gas stations. That could lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem. Marijuana is still stigmatized in many places, and having it out in the open might make people uncomfortable. \n\nI think in general, alcohol has more severe effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. However, it's hard to make generalizations because everyone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle them well, while others struggle with moderation. It's complex, and it's hard to make blanket statements about marijuana or any other substance.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with certain aspects of the Catholic Church, but I also see some inconsistency in their practices. They've maintained many traditions over time, which is good, but it's also essential to be open to change. On one hand, I think it's beneficial to draw from the past, but on the other hand, it's frustrating when it seems like the Church is inflexible and judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine precisely.\n\nFor instance, many Catholics believe in attending mass regularly, and they can be quite strict about how things are done. I feel that the Church sometimes looks down on people who don't conform to their expectations, and they also tend to be exclusive towards those with different faiths.\n\nMy personal experience with this is that my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's non-Catholic background. This didn't really demonstrate tolerance for other faiths, which is a core Catholic teaching – to love others. However, the Church's actions often seem hypocritical in this regard.\n\nI'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue, and I think people who engage in such acts would do so regardless of their marital status. It's not like having a spouse would somehow magically prevent them from harming children. So, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a solution to this problem.",
            "Well, I'm still undecided on this issue, but I think it's one of the most difficult topics we're dealing with right now. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a big part of it, and defining marriage in a way that doesn't offend anyone is a challenge in itself. I'm not sure if I think marriage should be viewed as a sacrament by the government or just a civil union between two people. If it's the former, then people might not get tax breaks or any special treatment if they're baptized, which seems unfair. On the other hand, if we view it as a civil union, then the government shouldn't be concerned with the details of the marriage, like whether it's a church wedding or not. It's just about two people who have committed to each other.\n\nIf that's the case, then the fact that gay couples can't get married because of the term \"marriage\" seems ridiculous. It's just a matter of two people getting a civil union, and that's it. If all the states could come to a sense of reason on this issue, then it should become a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a bit much. It's not a huge issue that should warrant changing the constitution. It's not important enough to amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that simple.",
            "I come from a Christian background, so I've always viewed homosexuality as a somewhat complex issue. Having a large circle of gay friends has made me think more deeply about it. While I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I think it's a matter that individual states should decide on their own, rather than relying on a national decision. This is because many states have different political leanings – some are more democratic, while others are more republican. If you live in a state with a democratic government, it's likely that they'll support gay marriage, and it's hard to disagree with their decision when you chose to live there. My stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so each state should have the freedom to decide on legalization based on their own values. I think it's unfair for the president to impose a blanket ban on gay marriage across the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his call to decide how each state should govern itself. Plus, he'll be out of office soon, and future presidents will likely have their own views on the matter. It's better to let individual states make their own decisions, as they'll have to live with the consequences. They're the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision, not the president.",
            "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I completely disagree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor a site like Myspace. Let me explain why. Myspace is a public platform, and as such, it's a place where users share content for anyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to understand that it's going to be viewed by others, including school officials. Even if you're not using the school's name, they could still access it from their homes.\n\nIn this case, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. The school system's primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of its students, and if that means checking out student activity on Myspace, then so be it. It's not an invasion of privacy if it helps prevent harm.\n\nLet's be real, if school officials are going on Myspace specifically to catch students misbehaving, that's a different story. That's an overreach. But if they're doing it to keep students safe, then I think it's a necessary measure. As long as it doesn't infringe on individual rights, I'm okay with it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but when you're talking, it's a bit more challenging. Let me try to clarify. If you post something on Myspace and expect not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Everything you post online is public, and it can come back to haunt you.\n\nThink about it like this: if you're a college student and you say something questionable in an email, it's going to follow you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. It's not like you can just erase it. If you're going to post something online, be prepared for the consequences.\n\nIn my opinion, students shouldn't be worried about school officials going on Myspace to catch them misbehaving. But if it leads to making the school system safer, then that's a different story. Other officials, like the police, should be allowed to monitor it too.\n\nWhen parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment. That's what school officials are trying to ensure. They're not just being nosy; they're trying to prevent something like a school shooting from happening. We had lockdown drills in my high school, and it was to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nIt's the same principle here. The school officials were doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. They were making the school a safer place, and that's something we should appreciate.\n\nThat's my take on it. I don't have much more to add.",
            "I've been hesitant to share my thoughts on the war, partly because I was personally affected by 9/11. At first, I was on board with the idea of going over there and making our presence known, but as time went on, I began to see the bigger picture. I think we rushed into the situation without a thorough plan, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's done anything meaningful, and I believe that as long as the people over there are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. But, unfortunately, 9/11 changed my perspective, and I've become somewhat apathetic towards their struggles. I sometimes feel like they're not even human, the way they wage war, and it's like they're not really trying to better their country. I think they just want us out, and that's it.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we went into this war with a lot of emotional baggage and a desire for revenge. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, at the time, somewhat understandable. We couldn't just let the attack go unpunished, but I do think we could have come up with a better plan. There was a lack of unity and a clear direction, which made things worse.\n\nIt's my honest opinion that we're not the ones to change those people. They're always going to be the way they are, and I don't think we're making enough progress to justify staying there. In fact, I believe that once we leave, everything will collapse, and we'll just be causing harm to ourselves by prolonging our stay. We can't stay there indefinitely, so it's better to just pull out and focus on our own issues."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes to stay relevant.  I think one reason people are losing interest in the Church is because it isn't very open-minded when it comes to certain issues.  They have rigid views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are outdated in many ways.  If they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, I don't think they'd be worried about losing followers. \n\nI've heard many people are turning against the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues.  People are starting to disagree with them on these topics, and that's causing some to question the Church's views.  They feel the Church is out of touch with modern values.  For example, if you support abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that sees it as morally wrong.  Similarly, if you're in favor of gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that disapproves of it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or have priests who are married.  It's not clear if that would have prevented scandals like the ones we've seen, but it's an idea worth considering.  It's hard to say whether allowing married priests or women priests would have made a difference, but it's worth exploring.  It's worth noting that other jobs involve balancing work and personal life – why can't priests do the same?\n\nThe Church views priests as married to God, devoted to a life of service.  However, most people in the world have a job and a family life, and they manage to balance both.  So, I don't see why priests can't have both a career and a family.",
            "to be honest, i'm a bit hesitant to express my thoughts on the topic of gay marriage. let me just say that personally, i don't have an issue with it - i think people should be free to live their lives however they choose. it's not something that i think is a conscious choice, and if someone is born with a certain orientation, i don't think they should be held accountable for it. it doesn't sit right with me to think that a couple of the same sex shouldn't be allowed to get married just because of their orientation.\n\ni think the key thing is that people are born the way they are, whether they're straight, gay, or whatever. it's not something that can be changed, and i don't think it's fair to judge someone for it. so, in my opinion, it's just wrong to deny people the right to get married based on their orientation.\n\ni'm not sure if i've really given this topic much thought, but i think it's clear to me that it's not about making a choice, it's about being who you are. and i don't think the federal government should be involved in making decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nit's just not their place to dictate how people live their lives, especially when it's something as fundamental as who they can marry. it's not a matter of national security or morality, it's just a matter of letting people be themselves. and if that means a same-sex couple wants to get married, then that's their choice, not the government's.\n\nanyway, that's my two cents on the matter. i'm not sure if i've made myself clear, but i think it's pretty simple - people should be free to live their lives as they see fit, and the government should stay out of it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no valid reason not to. The argument that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is just not convincing, considering the complexity of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct entities that can't be reduced to simple opposition. The fact is, gay couples have the same fundamental rights as straight couples, including property rights and access to healthcare, which are essential for ensuring the well-being of all individuals.\n\nHowever, when it comes to healthcare, gay couples often face unique challenges. For instance, their partners may not be recognized as family members, even if they're in a long-term committed relationship, which can limit their access to care and support. This seems unreasonable, especially considering the importance of having a supportive partner during times of illness.\n\nResearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of forming stable and fulfilling relationships as straight couples. They share similar relationship dynamics, and their relationships are just as likely to succeed. The trouble is that many people are hung up on the idea that gay marriage is somehow against their religious beliefs or moral code. But if we're talking about a civil union, a legal document issued by the government, then what's the issue? It's not about church and state; it's about recognizing the rights of all citizens.\n\nThe concept of segregation, where certain groups are treated unequally, is a major concern here. It's similar to the old days of \"separate but equal,\" which we've learned is fundamentally unfair. Gay couples are not asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document that recognizes their commitment to each other.\n\nPeople worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and prejudices. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted as those raised by straight parents. The real issue is how society treats these children, not their parents' sexual orientation. In fact, many schools and communities are working to create inclusive environments for these children, acknowledging that they deserve the same love, support, and respect as any other child.\n\nThe federal government should take a more prominent role in ensuring that gay marriage is recognized and protected nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is a step in the wrong direction, as it would impose a narrow, religious-based view on the entire country. This would be hypocritical, considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" debate and the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, organizations like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based research over personal opinions and cultural norms. If we listened more to institutions that conduct rigorous studies and less to popular opinion, we might gain a more nuanced understanding of these issues.",
            "Alright, so here's the thing, I work at the hospital pharmacy over the summer, and let's be real, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it can't have some benefits. I'm saying no to making it available to the general public, no way, but using it for medicinal purposes? That's a different story. We use loads of controlled substances in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, and they're super beneficial. So, just because marijuana is taboo doesn't mean we should deny its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not like these other controlled substances, either. If you abuse marijuana, it's not the same as abusing alcohol, which can lead to serious issues. It's a tough call, but I think we should allow it gradually, not all at once, because that would just lead to overuse. We need to break down the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might start using it responsibly.\n\nThe issue is that people have this awful image of marijuana in their heads, which isn't entirely fair. It's not like heroin or cocaine; it's not that bad for you. If we can change that image, people might start using it for medical purposes, and who knows, responsibly.",
            "i think the church has made an effort to adapt to modern times, but it's still not the strict institution it used to be.  growing up, i was a regular at church every sunday, dressing up in cute outfits, matching shoes, and a purse.  it was part of my routine, especially since i attended a private school where i saw my friends every weekend.  but over time, the church has changed, introducing a teenager mass that's just 30 minutes long and allowing more casual attire, even for the morning masses.  during the summer, people often show up in beachwear, and families often rush in late.  it's become a more relaxed atmosphere, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of traditional church clothes.  while it's nice to see a more casual approach, it's still the church i know.  as for the church's internal politics, i'm not well-versed on the details, but that's my general observation.\n\nregarding the accusations of pedophilia within the catholic church, i think these issues could've been avoided regardless of the church's policies on female priests or married priests.  in my opinion, pedophilia is more of a personal issue, and it's the individual's choice to become a priest.  there are already married men who become pedophiles, so allowing them to get married wouldn't necessarily solve the problem.  i also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's a personal decision, and they should consider a faith that allows them to be married if that's what they want.\n\nto elaborate, i think pedophilia is more of a genetic issue than something someone develops due to their environment.  while upbringing might play a small role, i believe it's largely based on genetics.  you can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and it's unlikely they'll be able to hide their true nature.  if the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a different matter altogether.  however, i don't think they necessarily knew about every case.  overall, i don't have any other thoughts on the catholic church beyond this.",
            "I'll be honest, my initial take on the whole situation was quite acceptable, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and the invasion of Iraq was largely a pretext. I believe the Bush administration initially tried to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nTo be frank, the fact that the Bush administration has been so open about lying to the American people really gets my blood boiling. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's a huge red flag in my book – it's essentially malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense.\n\nIt seems to me that the administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution and tried to marginalize it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war, and I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration's issues with him. On top of that, Bush's true motives seemed to be expanding our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nFrankly, I think it's time to move on, but withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more casualties. The alternative, which the UN and US are considering, is to form a coalition with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It'll likely lead to more problems down the line, especially with Iraq's sovereignty being a major issue. The interim government is essentially falling apart, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the situation. Even Mugtada al-Sadr's party holds a significant amount of power, and we're still dealing with radical elements fighting for control. It's clear the political process is facing a lot of friction due to these factors.\n\nTo be blunt, I don't have any polite words for the whole situation.",
            "i've been wanting to discuss my thoughts about the war in iraq for a while now, but to be honest, it's a really complicated topic for me. i guess you could say i'm still trying to wrap my head around it. one thing that's been on my mind is that it's not even a declared war, which kinda makes it hard to understand our presence over there. i feel like it was more of a retaliatory measure after the 9/11 attacks, and we've been staying in iraq to try and establish a democracy, which sounds great on paper, but it's not that simple. we're also trying to secure oil resources, which isn't a very compelling reason to stay. the problem is, we're just making things worse for everyone involved. if we stay, we'll have to invest a lot of time and money in building a democracy, which is a long-term commitment, and if we leave, the iraqis will be left to pick up the pieces and deal with the aftermath. it's a tough situation, and to be honest, i don't feel like i have a clear answer.\n\ni've been thinking a lot about how we got into this situation and how we can get out of it. one thing that's been on my mind is that we never actually declared war in congress, so it's not even a 'real' war in the eyes of some people. i'm not sure what the point is in staying over there anymore, and it's making our country look bad in the eyes of the world. it's a bit like the vietnam war, which was also undeclared and is now seen as a pointless conflict. our president is getting a bad reputation because of it, and i feel bad for him, but ultimately, it's not just about him - it's about the people who are suffering in iraq.\n\ni know some people have family members fighting over there, and it's hard to say that i want the war to end when i know how much it affects them. but at the same time, i'm worried that our presence is causing more harm than good. we're trying to impose our way of life on the iraqis, which isn't going to work, and it's only going to make them more resentful towards us. the whole al-qaeda thing is just going to get worse, and our efforts to establish a democracy are going to be a long, drawn-out process. i think this conflict is going to drag on for years to come, and i'm not sure what the end result will be.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure if I should even be having this conversation. But here's my take on it: I don't think it's right for a state to make it legal or even declare it as legal. I believe that's a decision that should be left up to the churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of that.\n\nIn my opinion, the people pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think any attempt to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and go against what's already been written. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right at all.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. It seems to me that the president's push for this amendment is driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There's no solid reason behind this amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society.\n\nTo be honest, I've said most of what I want to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, so I'm thinking about the war in Iraq and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. In my opinion, there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they're not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people following the 9/11 attacks and used that to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of sorts of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the aftermath of the invasion. A huge number of American soldiers have died, which is absolutely heartbreaking, and the US government wasn't prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to establish a democratic one, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, but it's a much more complicated process than people initially thought. The government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal, and not a clear-cut victory. In Vietnam, the US fought against an actual army, but in Iraq, they're fighting against citizens, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency.\n\nI think the government made a mistake by going to war without planning for all possible outcomes, and they weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying, and the US is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police to secure their own country. It's a long process, and I think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful mission.\n\nWe shouldn't have underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government, and it's not an easy thing to do, as we can see from our own country's history. The government made it seem like a relatively easy task, but it's not. \n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was weighing my options, and one of my reasons for considering George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, now that we've been in Iraq for so long, it's hard to justify continuing the war, especially considering the number of American casualties. It's a difficult decision, and I think we should try to see it through, but we also need to consider the astronomical number of casualties and whether it's worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIt's also interesting that we're not taking similar actions in other countries, like North Korea, which has weapons of mass destruction, but we're not targeting them. I think the real reason for invading Iraq is the oil issue and controlling resources. Another reason was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, it probably won't be that straightforward.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where to start with this, but I guess I'll just dive right in: I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage. I've always been, and I'm not really sure why I need to explain it, but I suppose I do. I think it's a deeply personal preference and something that's increasingly being shown to have a biological component, rather than being solely a product of societal influences. This makes it even harder to justify denying people the rights they deserve just because of something they can't control.\n\nI've always believed that it's inhumane to withhold rights based on something that's beyond an individual's control. And, to be honest, I think it's rather hypocritical for politicians and the government to try to dictate what constitutes a marriage. Marriage is a personal, intimate relationship that affects individuals at a deeply personal level, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they live their lives just like any other family would - they walk their dogs, go about their daily routines, and contribute to their community in the same ways as everyone else.\n\nIt's just ridiculous that the politicians are trying to impose their own twisted interpretation of marriage on everyone else. Bush's attempt to redefine marriage is nothing short of absurd. I've read and heard from countless credible sources that there's a chemical aspect to being gay, a predisposition that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. This biologically-based aspect is vastly different from sociological factors that might influence someone's choices.\n\nTo me, the most obvious issue with gay marriage is that it's a private matter, not something that should be subject to public scrutiny or federal approval. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, and it won't make the headlines. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front-page news. I think that's a clear indication that we need to treat marriage as a private, personal issue, rather than a matter of public policy.",
            "Honestly, people often neglect the fact that anything posted online is now public domain. It's completely out in the open, and you can't retract it if you change your mind. As an RA, I've already dealt with this issue firsthand. When you share something, it can shape how others view you, and that's something to consider. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, someone's bound to react. You can't hide that information, and it's not something you can just keep to yourself.\n\nThe internet is a broad platform that everyone can access. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll likely see their bulletin. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in our case, but someone had access to it and shared it with the authorities. The school has a responsibility to act on potentially threatening situations to prevent harm.\n\nIt's difficult to know what to take seriously when some people post things as jokes or for a sociological experiment. We had a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's online presence was reviewed, and some of the content they had posted was perceived as serious, even though it might have been intended as a joke.\n\nWhen you post something online, you lose any expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, you shouldn't post it. You can't dictate what others think or take seriously. I don't think it's a good idea for school officials to have social media accounts and be friends with students. However, if something's brought to their attention, they can't ignore it if it poses a potential threat.\n\nI don't think schools should monitor phone conversations, texts, or IMs, but if a student reports a concern, it's a different story. As an RA, I don't even have a Facebook or Myspace account – I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives or see their photos online. It's not my place to know that information, and I certainly don't want the responsibility that comes with it.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At the beginning, the idea was to restore democracy in a country that was in dire need of it, but I think we've lost sight of that original purpose a long time ago. It seems like we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a superpower. \n\nI've always wondered if the motives behind the war were pure to begin with, especially considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If our goal was genuinely to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, that would be a noble cause – as long as it wasn't motivated by personal interests. But I believe that's not the case. The war has dragged on for over a year, and I think we've already made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a powerful statement in itself.\n\nHowever, the fact that it's been going on for years is just ridiculous. If our initial intention was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a just cause. But I think our reasons have been distorted and misconstrued over time. It seems like we're still fighting just for the sake of fighting, and we don't want to end the war without a clear victory. \n\nI truly believe it's time to bring this war to an end. Our government officials need to take responsibility for their own affairs, and I think that time has come. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal issues that need funding. I think it's a drain on our economy for a cause that's long since been lost.\n\nThe amount of money being spent is staggering – billions and billions of dollars that could be better spent on our own internal problems, like public roads, education, and healthcare. It's disheartening to think that some of our own citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost sight of its purpose. I think that's a tragedy.",
            "I had a question that I wanted to clarify, but I'm not sure where to start. It seems that someone was able to intervene in a situation because they found some information online that was quite revealing.\n\nHonestly, it's pretty much expected that when you post stuff online, especially on sites like Myspace, it's going to be out there for everyone to see. You have to be a member to view someone's profile, but that's because you've essentially given permission for others to see it when you accepted their friend request. So, anytime you put information online, you have to be aware that a lot of people might see it.\n\nI have to admit, in this case, I think it's a good thing that someone was able to see that information and prevent a potentially serious situation. However, I can see why it's tricky. It's not practical or fair to have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles just in case. It could be seen as discriminatory if they're only focusing on certain people.\n\nI'm not sure how it would work in practice, but it's all about context. Was someone just browsing randomly or were they actively looking for something specific? If it's the former, it's a bit creepy, but if it's the latter, then maybe it's not such a bad thing.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who could be seeing my information. I recall this one TV show where a guy demonstrated just how easy it is to get information online and use it to meet people. It's unnerving, to say the least. I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they can figure out who I am and contact me through instant messaging. It's a delicate balance between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends and classmates. It's a tough issue because you never know who might be looking at what. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned Myspace, and it seemed a bit strange. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complicated situation, and I'm still not entirely sure what to think about it.",
            "i'm having trouble talking about the Iraq War, to be honest, because I feel like I'm jumping on a bandwagon \nI'm hesitant to admit that I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore \nThe general consensus among people, except for those within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea, and I'm inclined to agree \nLooking at the polls - both in the US, Iraq, and globally - it's clear that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a mistake \nIn fact, even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year \nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the get-go, and it's becoming increasingly clear that pulling out won't be easy either \nI think it's because of the huge cultural divide between the US and the Middle East, and the fact that we're trying to impose democracy in a region where it may not be welcomed \nI mean, Saddam was without a doubt a bad guy, but you can't just invade a country without considering the potential consequences \nIt's like trying to impose Western values on a completely different culture \nI'm still not convinced that there's a good reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary \nI'm not sure I buy the administration's arguments for why we should stay, and I'm yet to hear a legitimate reason for extending our presence \nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now \nIt's clear that the Iraqi people would like us to leave, with around 80% wanting us out within a year and a quarter thinking we should leave immediately \nIt makes sense to me that they might know better than we do, and if we ask them and they say yes, then it's on them if things go wrong \nIf we leave, at least we can say we tried to do the right thing, even if it's not like we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East",
            "i think there's still a lot of gender discrimination going on in the US.  i'm not just talking about women, though - it's also about the specific job or field someone's in.  overall, i feel like women have it tougher because there's this concept of a 'glass ceiling' where they're supposed to be equal but in reality, people often have a hard time accepting a woman in charge, even when she's qualified for the job.  it's because of how society's been raised for so long - people are used to men being in charge.  so, women might see a job they're qualified for, but the board won't promote them because it's not common to see women in upper management.  the same thing happens to men in industries like fashion or childcare - it's not common for men to be the primary caregivers, and people look down on them for it.  they're seen as the breadwinners and it's weird if they stay home to take care of the kids.\n\nin fashion, it's even harder for men who are straight because people don't take them seriously.  it's like, if you're a man who's into fashion, people assume you're not really into it because it's not typically something men do.  they think you're just pretending to be like other guys who are into fashion.  it's the same with women in male-dominated fields - people assume they're not really good at it because they're women.\n\nit's hard to change this mindset because society is set in its ways.  we've made progress, but it's slow.  we've come a long way since the 1800s, but it's still a slow process.  women are getting into higher positions and becoming CEOs, which is a good start.  and it's also becoming more acceptable for men to be stay-at-home dads.  but we still have to promote the good qualities of people who are being stereotyped.  we can't just force it, because people will resist.  we're at a good point now where we're starting to see some changes, but it takes time.\n\nanother thing is that people are discriminated against based on where they're from, not just their gender.  like, if you grew up on a farm and you're not a great speaker, but you're super intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, people might look down on you because of your accent.  or if you're a man and you're not a good writer, people might think you're not smart because of that.  it's not just about gender, it's about where you come from and how you speak.",
            "So, I wanted to clarify how the law has changed on this issue. They've made some changes, apparently decriminalizing it, which means it's not as serious of an offense as it used to be. It's more like getting a traffic ticket, where you might get fined, but you won't be arrested and charged like before. Now, I know some people might worry about the future consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized - it can still impact things like job interviews and other opportunities. On the other hand, there's a argument that arresting people, prosecuting them, and putting them through the system is really expensive. When you think about it, it adds up - arresting, booking, housing them, and then going through the court process, just to let them go. Plus, there's the cost of appointing a public defender, paying the judge, and having the state attorney's office handle the case. It all adds up, and it's not a small expense.\n\nIn places that are struggling financially, some officials might not be willing to make this change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things. But in cities like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize marijuana. I think it's a good idea because it can free up funds for things like education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not just about making marijuana freely available; it's about the financial benefits and the potential to use that money for good.\n\nOf course, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available. Some people might worry that it would be too easily accessible, like cigarettes sold in gas stations. That could lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem. Marijuana is still stigmatized in many places, and having it out in the open might make people uncomfortable. \n\nI think in general, alcohol has more severe effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. However, it's hard to make generalizations because everyone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle them well, while others struggle with moderation. It's complex, and it's hard to make blanket statements about marijuana or any other substance.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with certain aspects of the Catholic Church, but I also see some inconsistency in their practices. They've maintained many traditions over time, which is good, but it's also essential to be open to change. On one hand, I think it's beneficial to draw from the past, but on the other hand, it's frustrating when it seems like the Church is inflexible and judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine precisely.\n\nFor instance, many Catholics believe in attending mass regularly, and they can be quite strict about how things are done. I feel that the Church sometimes looks down on people who don't conform to their expectations, and they also tend to be exclusive towards those with different faiths.\n\nMy personal experience with this is that my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's non-Catholic background. This didn't really demonstrate tolerance for other faiths, which is a core Catholic teaching – to love others. However, the Church's actions often seem hypocritical in this regard.\n\nI'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue, and I think people who engage in such acts would do so regardless of their marital status. It's not like having a spouse would somehow magically prevent them from harming children. So, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a solution to this problem.",
            "Well, I'm still undecided on this issue, but I think it's one of the most difficult topics we're dealing with right now. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a big part of it, and defining marriage in a way that doesn't offend anyone is a challenge in itself. I'm not sure if I think marriage should be viewed as a sacrament by the government or just a civil union between two people. If it's the former, then people might not get tax breaks or any special treatment if they're baptized, which seems unfair. On the other hand, if we view it as a civil union, then the government shouldn't be concerned with the details of the marriage, like whether it's a church wedding or not. It's just about two people who have committed to each other.\n\nIf that's the case, then the fact that gay couples can't get married because of the term \"marriage\" seems ridiculous. It's just a matter of two people getting a civil union, and that's it. If all the states could come to a sense of reason on this issue, then it should become a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a bit much. It's not a huge issue that should warrant changing the constitution. It's not important enough to amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that simple.",
            "I come from a Christian background, so I've always viewed homosexuality as a somewhat complex issue. Having a large circle of gay friends has made me think more deeply about it. While I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I think it's a matter that individual states should decide on their own, rather than relying on a national decision. This is because many states have different political leanings – some are more democratic, while others are more republican. If you live in a state with a democratic government, it's likely that they'll support gay marriage, and it's hard to disagree with their decision when you chose to live there. My stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so each state should have the freedom to decide on legalization based on their own values. I think it's unfair for the president to impose a blanket ban on gay marriage across the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his call to decide how each state should govern itself. Plus, he'll be out of office soon, and future presidents will likely have their own views on the matter. It's better to let individual states make their own decisions, as they'll have to live with the consequences. They're the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision, not the president.",
            "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I completely disagree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor a site like Myspace. Let me explain why. Myspace is a public platform, and as such, it's a place where users share content for anyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to understand that it's going to be viewed by others, including school officials. Even if you're not using the school's name, they could still access it from their homes.\n\nIn this case, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. The school system's primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of its students, and if that means checking out student activity on Myspace, then so be it. It's not an invasion of privacy if it helps prevent harm.\n\nLet's be real, if school officials are going on Myspace specifically to catch students misbehaving, that's a different story. That's an overreach. But if they're doing it to keep students safe, then I think it's a necessary measure. As long as it doesn't infringe on individual rights, I'm okay with it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but when you're talking, it's a bit more challenging. Let me try to clarify. If you post something on Myspace and expect not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Everything you post online is public, and it can come back to haunt you.\n\nThink about it like this: if you're a college student and you say something questionable in an email, it's going to follow you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. It's not like you can just erase it. If you're going to post something online, be prepared for the consequences.\n\nIn my opinion, students shouldn't be worried about school officials going on Myspace to catch them misbehaving. But if it leads to making the school system safer, then that's a different story. Other officials, like the police, should be allowed to monitor it too.\n\nWhen parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment. That's what school officials are trying to ensure. They're not just being nosy; they're trying to prevent something like a school shooting from happening. We had lockdown drills in my high school, and it was to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nIt's the same principle here. The school officials were doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. They were making the school a safer place, and that's something we should appreciate.\n\nThat's my take on it. I don't have much more to add.",
            "I've been hesitant to share my thoughts on the war, partly because I was personally affected by 9/11. At first, I was on board with the idea of going over there and making our presence known, but as time went on, I began to see the bigger picture. I think we rushed into the situation without a thorough plan, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's done anything meaningful, and I believe that as long as the people over there are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. But, unfortunately, 9/11 changed my perspective, and I've become somewhat apathetic towards their struggles. I sometimes feel like they're not even human, the way they wage war, and it's like they're not really trying to better their country. I think they just want us out, and that's it.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we went into this war with a lot of emotional baggage and a desire for revenge. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, at the time, somewhat understandable. We couldn't just let the attack go unpunished, but I do think we could have come up with a better plan. There was a lack of unity and a clear direction, which made things worse.\n\nIt's my honest opinion that we're not the ones to change those people. They're always going to be the way they are, and I don't think we're making enough progress to justify staying there. In fact, I believe that once we leave, everything will collapse, and we'll just be causing harm to ourselves by prolonging our stay. We can't stay there indefinitely, so it's better to just pull out and focus on our own issues."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes to stay relevant.  I think one reason people are losing interest in the Church is because it isn't very open-minded when it comes to certain issues.  They have rigid views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are outdated in many ways.  If they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, I don't think they'd be worried about losing followers. \n\nI've heard many people are turning against the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues.  People are starting to disagree with them on these topics, and that's causing some to question the Church's views.  They feel the Church is out of touch with modern values.  For example, if you support abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that sees it as morally wrong.  Similarly, if you're in favor of gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that disapproves of it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or have priests who are married.  It's not clear if that would have prevented scandals like the ones we've seen, but it's an idea worth considering.  It's hard to say whether allowing married priests or women priests would have made a difference, but it's worth exploring.  It's worth noting that other jobs involve balancing work and personal life – why can't priests do the same?\n\nThe Church views priests as married to God, devoted to a life of service.  However, most people in the world have a job and a family life, and they manage to balance both.  So, I don't see why priests can't have both a career and a family.",
            "to be honest, i'm a bit hesitant to express my thoughts on the topic of gay marriage. let me just say that personally, i don't have an issue with it - i think people should be free to live their lives however they choose. it's not something that i think is a conscious choice, and if someone is born with a certain orientation, i don't think they should be held accountable for it. it doesn't sit right with me to think that a couple of the same sex shouldn't be allowed to get married just because of their orientation.\n\ni think the key thing is that people are born the way they are, whether they're straight, gay, or whatever. it's not something that can be changed, and i don't think it's fair to judge someone for it. so, in my opinion, it's just wrong to deny people the right to get married based on their orientation.\n\ni'm not sure if i've really given this topic much thought, but i think it's clear to me that it's not about making a choice, it's about being who you are. and i don't think the federal government should be involved in making decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nit's just not their place to dictate how people live their lives, especially when it's something as fundamental as who they can marry. it's not a matter of national security or morality, it's just a matter of letting people be themselves. and if that means a same-sex couple wants to get married, then that's their choice, not the government's.\n\nanyway, that's my two cents on the matter. i'm not sure if i've made myself clear, but i think it's pretty simple - people should be free to live their lives as they see fit, and the government should stay out of it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no valid reason not to. The argument that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is just not convincing, considering the complexity of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct entities that can't be reduced to simple opposition. The fact is, gay couples have the same fundamental rights as straight couples, including property rights and access to healthcare, which are essential for ensuring the well-being of all individuals.\n\nHowever, when it comes to healthcare, gay couples often face unique challenges. For instance, their partners may not be recognized as family members, even if they're in a long-term committed relationship, which can limit their access to care and support. This seems unreasonable, especially considering the importance of having a supportive partner during times of illness.\n\nResearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of forming stable and fulfilling relationships as straight couples. They share similar relationship dynamics, and their relationships are just as likely to succeed. The trouble is that many people are hung up on the idea that gay marriage is somehow against their religious beliefs or moral code. But if we're talking about a civil union, a legal document issued by the government, then what's the issue? It's not about church and state; it's about recognizing the rights of all citizens.\n\nThe concept of segregation, where certain groups are treated unequally, is a major concern here. It's similar to the old days of \"separate but equal,\" which we've learned is fundamentally unfair. Gay couples are not asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document that recognizes their commitment to each other.\n\nPeople worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and prejudices. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted as those raised by straight parents. The real issue is how society treats these children, not their parents' sexual orientation. In fact, many schools and communities are working to create inclusive environments for these children, acknowledging that they deserve the same love, support, and respect as any other child.\n\nThe federal government should take a more prominent role in ensuring that gay marriage is recognized and protected nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is a step in the wrong direction, as it would impose a narrow, religious-based view on the entire country. This would be hypocritical, considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" debate and the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, organizations like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based research over personal opinions and cultural norms. If we listened more to institutions that conduct rigorous studies and less to popular opinion, we might gain a more nuanced understanding of these issues.",
            "Alright, so here's the thing, I work at the hospital pharmacy over the summer, and let's be real, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it can't have some benefits. I'm saying no to making it available to the general public, no way, but using it for medicinal purposes? That's a different story. We use loads of controlled substances in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, and they're super beneficial. So, just because marijuana is taboo doesn't mean we should deny its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not like these other controlled substances, either. If you abuse marijuana, it's not the same as abusing alcohol, which can lead to serious issues. It's a tough call, but I think we should allow it gradually, not all at once, because that would just lead to overuse. We need to break down the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might start using it responsibly.\n\nThe issue is that people have this awful image of marijuana in their heads, which isn't entirely fair. It's not like heroin or cocaine; it's not that bad for you. If we can change that image, people might start using it for medical purposes, and who knows, responsibly.",
            "i think the church has made an effort to adapt to modern times, but it's still not the strict institution it used to be.  growing up, i was a regular at church every sunday, dressing up in cute outfits, matching shoes, and a purse.  it was part of my routine, especially since i attended a private school where i saw my friends every weekend.  but over time, the church has changed, introducing a teenager mass that's just 30 minutes long and allowing more casual attire, even for the morning masses.  during the summer, people often show up in beachwear, and families often rush in late.  it's become a more relaxed atmosphere, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of traditional church clothes.  while it's nice to see a more casual approach, it's still the church i know.  as for the church's internal politics, i'm not well-versed on the details, but that's my general observation.\n\nregarding the accusations of pedophilia within the catholic church, i think these issues could've been avoided regardless of the church's policies on female priests or married priests.  in my opinion, pedophilia is more of a personal issue, and it's the individual's choice to become a priest.  there are already married men who become pedophiles, so allowing them to get married wouldn't necessarily solve the problem.  i also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's a personal decision, and they should consider a faith that allows them to be married if that's what they want.\n\nto elaborate, i think pedophilia is more of a genetic issue than something someone develops due to their environment.  while upbringing might play a small role, i believe it's largely based on genetics.  you can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and it's unlikely they'll be able to hide their true nature.  if the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a different matter altogether.  however, i don't think they necessarily knew about every case.  overall, i don't have any other thoughts on the catholic church beyond this.",
            "I'll be honest, my initial take on the whole situation was quite acceptable, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and the invasion of Iraq was largely a pretext. I believe the Bush administration initially tried to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nTo be frank, the fact that the Bush administration has been so open about lying to the American people really gets my blood boiling. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's a huge red flag in my book – it's essentially malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense.\n\nIt seems to me that the administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution and tried to marginalize it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war, and I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration's issues with him. On top of that, Bush's true motives seemed to be expanding our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nFrankly, I think it's time to move on, but withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more casualties. The alternative, which the UN and US are considering, is to form a coalition with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It'll likely lead to more problems down the line, especially with Iraq's sovereignty being a major issue. The interim government is essentially falling apart, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the situation. Even Mugtada al-Sadr's party holds a significant amount of power, and we're still dealing with radical elements fighting for control. It's clear the political process is facing a lot of friction due to these factors.\n\nTo be blunt, I don't have any polite words for the whole situation.",
            "i've been wanting to discuss my thoughts about the war in iraq for a while now, but to be honest, it's a really complicated topic for me. i guess you could say i'm still trying to wrap my head around it. one thing that's been on my mind is that it's not even a declared war, which kinda makes it hard to understand our presence over there. i feel like it was more of a retaliatory measure after the 9/11 attacks, and we've been staying in iraq to try and establish a democracy, which sounds great on paper, but it's not that simple. we're also trying to secure oil resources, which isn't a very compelling reason to stay. the problem is, we're just making things worse for everyone involved. if we stay, we'll have to invest a lot of time and money in building a democracy, which is a long-term commitment, and if we leave, the iraqis will be left to pick up the pieces and deal with the aftermath. it's a tough situation, and to be honest, i don't feel like i have a clear answer.\n\ni've been thinking a lot about how we got into this situation and how we can get out of it. one thing that's been on my mind is that we never actually declared war in congress, so it's not even a 'real' war in the eyes of some people. i'm not sure what the point is in staying over there anymore, and it's making our country look bad in the eyes of the world. it's a bit like the vietnam war, which was also undeclared and is now seen as a pointless conflict. our president is getting a bad reputation because of it, and i feel bad for him, but ultimately, it's not just about him - it's about the people who are suffering in iraq.\n\ni know some people have family members fighting over there, and it's hard to say that i want the war to end when i know how much it affects them. but at the same time, i'm worried that our presence is causing more harm than good. we're trying to impose our way of life on the iraqis, which isn't going to work, and it's only going to make them more resentful towards us. the whole al-qaeda thing is just going to get worse, and our efforts to establish a democracy are going to be a long, drawn-out process. i think this conflict is going to drag on for years to come, and i'm not sure what the end result will be.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure if I should even be having this conversation. But here's my take on it: I don't think it's right for a state to make it legal or even declare it as legal. I believe that's a decision that should be left up to the churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of that.\n\nIn my opinion, the people pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think any attempt to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and go against what's already been written. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right at all.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. It seems to me that the president's push for this amendment is driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There's no solid reason behind this amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society.\n\nTo be honest, I've said most of what I want to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, so I'm thinking about the war in Iraq and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. In my opinion, there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they're not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people following the 9/11 attacks and used that to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of sorts of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the aftermath of the invasion. A huge number of American soldiers have died, which is absolutely heartbreaking, and the US government wasn't prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to establish a democratic one, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, but it's a much more complicated process than people initially thought. The government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal, and not a clear-cut victory. In Vietnam, the US fought against an actual army, but in Iraq, they're fighting against citizens, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency.\n\nI think the government made a mistake by going to war without planning for all possible outcomes, and they weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying, and the US is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police to secure their own country. It's a long process, and I think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful mission.\n\nWe shouldn't have underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government, and it's not an easy thing to do, as we can see from our own country's history. The government made it seem like a relatively easy task, but it's not. \n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was weighing my options, and one of my reasons for considering George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, now that we've been in Iraq for so long, it's hard to justify continuing the war, especially considering the number of American casualties. It's a difficult decision, and I think we should try to see it through, but we also need to consider the astronomical number of casualties and whether it's worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIt's also interesting that we're not taking similar actions in other countries, like North Korea, which has weapons of mass destruction, but we're not targeting them. I think the real reason for invading Iraq is the oil issue and controlling resources. Another reason was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, it probably won't be that straightforward.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where to start with this, but I guess I'll just dive right in: I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage. I've always been, and I'm not really sure why I need to explain it, but I suppose I do. I think it's a deeply personal preference and something that's increasingly being shown to have a biological component, rather than being solely a product of societal influences. This makes it even harder to justify denying people the rights they deserve just because of something they can't control.\n\nI've always believed that it's inhumane to withhold rights based on something that's beyond an individual's control. And, to be honest, I think it's rather hypocritical for politicians and the government to try to dictate what constitutes a marriage. Marriage is a personal, intimate relationship that affects individuals at a deeply personal level, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they live their lives just like any other family would - they walk their dogs, go about their daily routines, and contribute to their community in the same ways as everyone else.\n\nIt's just ridiculous that the politicians are trying to impose their own twisted interpretation of marriage on everyone else. Bush's attempt to redefine marriage is nothing short of absurd. I've read and heard from countless credible sources that there's a chemical aspect to being gay, a predisposition that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. This biologically-based aspect is vastly different from sociological factors that might influence someone's choices.\n\nTo me, the most obvious issue with gay marriage is that it's a private matter, not something that should be subject to public scrutiny or federal approval. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, and it won't make the headlines. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front-page news. I think that's a clear indication that we need to treat marriage as a private, personal issue, rather than a matter of public policy.",
            "Honestly, people often neglect the fact that anything posted online is now public domain. It's completely out in the open, and you can't retract it if you change your mind. As an RA, I've already dealt with this issue firsthand. When you share something, it can shape how others view you, and that's something to consider. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, someone's bound to react. You can't hide that information, and it's not something you can just keep to yourself.\n\nThe internet is a broad platform that everyone can access. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll likely see their bulletin. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in our case, but someone had access to it and shared it with the authorities. The school has a responsibility to act on potentially threatening situations to prevent harm.\n\nIt's difficult to know what to take seriously when some people post things as jokes or for a sociological experiment. We had a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's online presence was reviewed, and some of the content they had posted was perceived as serious, even though it might have been intended as a joke.\n\nWhen you post something online, you lose any expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, you shouldn't post it. You can't dictate what others think or take seriously. I don't think it's a good idea for school officials to have social media accounts and be friends with students. However, if something's brought to their attention, they can't ignore it if it poses a potential threat.\n\nI don't think schools should monitor phone conversations, texts, or IMs, but if a student reports a concern, it's a different story. As an RA, I don't even have a Facebook or Myspace account – I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives or see their photos online. It's not my place to know that information, and I certainly don't want the responsibility that comes with it.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At the beginning, the idea was to restore democracy in a country that was in dire need of it, but I think we've lost sight of that original purpose a long time ago. It seems like we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a superpower. \n\nI've always wondered if the motives behind the war were pure to begin with, especially considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If our goal was genuinely to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, that would be a noble cause – as long as it wasn't motivated by personal interests. But I believe that's not the case. The war has dragged on for over a year, and I think we've already made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a powerful statement in itself.\n\nHowever, the fact that it's been going on for years is just ridiculous. If our initial intention was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a just cause. But I think our reasons have been distorted and misconstrued over time. It seems like we're still fighting just for the sake of fighting, and we don't want to end the war without a clear victory. \n\nI truly believe it's time to bring this war to an end. Our government officials need to take responsibility for their own affairs, and I think that time has come. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal issues that need funding. I think it's a drain on our economy for a cause that's long since been lost.\n\nThe amount of money being spent is staggering – billions and billions of dollars that could be better spent on our own internal problems, like public roads, education, and healthcare. It's disheartening to think that some of our own citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost sight of its purpose. I think that's a tragedy.",
            "I had a question that I wanted to clarify, but I'm not sure where to start. It seems that someone was able to intervene in a situation because they found some information online that was quite revealing.\n\nHonestly, it's pretty much expected that when you post stuff online, especially on sites like Myspace, it's going to be out there for everyone to see. You have to be a member to view someone's profile, but that's because you've essentially given permission for others to see it when you accepted their friend request. So, anytime you put information online, you have to be aware that a lot of people might see it.\n\nI have to admit, in this case, I think it's a good thing that someone was able to see that information and prevent a potentially serious situation. However, I can see why it's tricky. It's not practical or fair to have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles just in case. It could be seen as discriminatory if they're only focusing on certain people.\n\nI'm not sure how it would work in practice, but it's all about context. Was someone just browsing randomly or were they actively looking for something specific? If it's the former, it's a bit creepy, but if it's the latter, then maybe it's not such a bad thing.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who could be seeing my information. I recall this one TV show where a guy demonstrated just how easy it is to get information online and use it to meet people. It's unnerving, to say the least. I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they can figure out who I am and contact me through instant messaging. It's a delicate balance between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends and classmates. It's a tough issue because you never know who might be looking at what. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned Myspace, and it seemed a bit strange. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complicated situation, and I'm still not entirely sure what to think about it.",
            "i'm having trouble talking about the Iraq War, to be honest, because I feel like I'm jumping on a bandwagon \nI'm hesitant to admit that I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore \nThe general consensus among people, except for those within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea, and I'm inclined to agree \nLooking at the polls - both in the US, Iraq, and globally - it's clear that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a mistake \nIn fact, even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year \nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the get-go, and it's becoming increasingly clear that pulling out won't be easy either \nI think it's because of the huge cultural divide between the US and the Middle East, and the fact that we're trying to impose democracy in a region where it may not be welcomed \nI mean, Saddam was without a doubt a bad guy, but you can't just invade a country without considering the potential consequences \nIt's like trying to impose Western values on a completely different culture \nI'm still not convinced that there's a good reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary \nI'm not sure I buy the administration's arguments for why we should stay, and I'm yet to hear a legitimate reason for extending our presence \nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now \nIt's clear that the Iraqi people would like us to leave, with around 80% wanting us out within a year and a quarter thinking we should leave immediately \nIt makes sense to me that they might know better than we do, and if we ask them and they say yes, then it's on them if things go wrong \nIf we leave, at least we can say we tried to do the right thing, even if it's not like we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East",
            "i think there's still a lot of gender discrimination going on in the US.  i'm not just talking about women, though - it's also about the specific job or field someone's in.  overall, i feel like women have it tougher because there's this concept of a 'glass ceiling' where they're supposed to be equal but in reality, people often have a hard time accepting a woman in charge, even when she's qualified for the job.  it's because of how society's been raised for so long - people are used to men being in charge.  so, women might see a job they're qualified for, but the board won't promote them because it's not common to see women in upper management.  the same thing happens to men in industries like fashion or childcare - it's not common for men to be the primary caregivers, and people look down on them for it.  they're seen as the breadwinners and it's weird if they stay home to take care of the kids.\n\nin fashion, it's even harder for men who are straight because people don't take them seriously.  it's like, if you're a man who's into fashion, people assume you're not really into it because it's not typically something men do.  they think you're just pretending to be like other guys who are into fashion.  it's the same with women in male-dominated fields - people assume they're not really good at it because they're women.\n\nit's hard to change this mindset because society is set in its ways.  we've made progress, but it's slow.  we've come a long way since the 1800s, but it's still a slow process.  women are getting into higher positions and becoming CEOs, which is a good start.  and it's also becoming more acceptable for men to be stay-at-home dads.  but we still have to promote the good qualities of people who are being stereotyped.  we can't just force it, because people will resist.  we're at a good point now where we're starting to see some changes, but it takes time.\n\nanother thing is that people are discriminated against based on where they're from, not just their gender.  like, if you grew up on a farm and you're not a great speaker, but you're super intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, people might look down on you because of your accent.  or if you're a man and you're not a good writer, people might think you're not smart because of that.  it's not just about gender, it's about where you come from and how you speak.",
            "So, I wanted to clarify how the law has changed on this issue. They've made some changes, apparently decriminalizing it, which means it's not as serious of an offense as it used to be. It's more like getting a traffic ticket, where you might get fined, but you won't be arrested and charged like before. Now, I know some people might worry about the future consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized - it can still impact things like job interviews and other opportunities. On the other hand, there's a argument that arresting people, prosecuting them, and putting them through the system is really expensive. When you think about it, it adds up - arresting, booking, housing them, and then going through the court process, just to let them go. Plus, there's the cost of appointing a public defender, paying the judge, and having the state attorney's office handle the case. It all adds up, and it's not a small expense.\n\nIn places that are struggling financially, some officials might not be willing to make this change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things. But in cities like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize marijuana. I think it's a good idea because it can free up funds for things like education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not just about making marijuana freely available; it's about the financial benefits and the potential to use that money for good.\n\nOf course, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available. Some people might worry that it would be too easily accessible, like cigarettes sold in gas stations. That could lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem. Marijuana is still stigmatized in many places, and having it out in the open might make people uncomfortable. \n\nI think in general, alcohol has more severe effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. However, it's hard to make generalizations because everyone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle them well, while others struggle with moderation. It's complex, and it's hard to make blanket statements about marijuana or any other substance.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with certain aspects of the Catholic Church, but I also see some inconsistency in their practices. They've maintained many traditions over time, which is good, but it's also essential to be open to change. On one hand, I think it's beneficial to draw from the past, but on the other hand, it's frustrating when it seems like the Church is inflexible and judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine precisely.\n\nFor instance, many Catholics believe in attending mass regularly, and they can be quite strict about how things are done. I feel that the Church sometimes looks down on people who don't conform to their expectations, and they also tend to be exclusive towards those with different faiths.\n\nMy personal experience with this is that my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's non-Catholic background. This didn't really demonstrate tolerance for other faiths, which is a core Catholic teaching – to love others. However, the Church's actions often seem hypocritical in this regard.\n\nI'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue, and I think people who engage in such acts would do so regardless of their marital status. It's not like having a spouse would somehow magically prevent them from harming children. So, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a solution to this problem.",
            "Well, I'm still undecided on this issue, but I think it's one of the most difficult topics we're dealing with right now. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a big part of it, and defining marriage in a way that doesn't offend anyone is a challenge in itself. I'm not sure if I think marriage should be viewed as a sacrament by the government or just a civil union between two people. If it's the former, then people might not get tax breaks or any special treatment if they're baptized, which seems unfair. On the other hand, if we view it as a civil union, then the government shouldn't be concerned with the details of the marriage, like whether it's a church wedding or not. It's just about two people who have committed to each other.\n\nIf that's the case, then the fact that gay couples can't get married because of the term \"marriage\" seems ridiculous. It's just a matter of two people getting a civil union, and that's it. If all the states could come to a sense of reason on this issue, then it should become a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a bit much. It's not a huge issue that should warrant changing the constitution. It's not important enough to amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that simple.",
            "I come from a Christian background, so I've always viewed homosexuality as a somewhat complex issue. Having a large circle of gay friends has made me think more deeply about it. While I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I think it's a matter that individual states should decide on their own, rather than relying on a national decision. This is because many states have different political leanings – some are more democratic, while others are more republican. If you live in a state with a democratic government, it's likely that they'll support gay marriage, and it's hard to disagree with their decision when you chose to live there. My stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so each state should have the freedom to decide on legalization based on their own values. I think it's unfair for the president to impose a blanket ban on gay marriage across the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his call to decide how each state should govern itself. Plus, he'll be out of office soon, and future presidents will likely have their own views on the matter. It's better to let individual states make their own decisions, as they'll have to live with the consequences. They're the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision, not the president.",
            "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I completely disagree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor a site like Myspace. Let me explain why. Myspace is a public platform, and as such, it's a place where users share content for anyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to understand that it's going to be viewed by others, including school officials. Even if you're not using the school's name, they could still access it from their homes.\n\nIn this case, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. The school system's primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of its students, and if that means checking out student activity on Myspace, then so be it. It's not an invasion of privacy if it helps prevent harm.\n\nLet's be real, if school officials are going on Myspace specifically to catch students misbehaving, that's a different story. That's an overreach. But if they're doing it to keep students safe, then I think it's a necessary measure. As long as it doesn't infringe on individual rights, I'm okay with it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but when you're talking, it's a bit more challenging. Let me try to clarify. If you post something on Myspace and expect not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Everything you post online is public, and it can come back to haunt you.\n\nThink about it like this: if you're a college student and you say something questionable in an email, it's going to follow you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. It's not like you can just erase it. If you're going to post something online, be prepared for the consequences.\n\nIn my opinion, students shouldn't be worried about school officials going on Myspace to catch them misbehaving. But if it leads to making the school system safer, then that's a different story. Other officials, like the police, should be allowed to monitor it too.\n\nWhen parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment. That's what school officials are trying to ensure. They're not just being nosy; they're trying to prevent something like a school shooting from happening. We had lockdown drills in my high school, and it was to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nIt's the same principle here. The school officials were doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. They were making the school a safer place, and that's something we should appreciate.\n\nThat's my take on it. I don't have much more to add.",
            "I've been hesitant to share my thoughts on the war, partly because I was personally affected by 9/11. At first, I was on board with the idea of going over there and making our presence known, but as time went on, I began to see the bigger picture. I think we rushed into the situation without a thorough plan, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's done anything meaningful, and I believe that as long as the people over there are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. But, unfortunately, 9/11 changed my perspective, and I've become somewhat apathetic towards their struggles. I sometimes feel like they're not even human, the way they wage war, and it's like they're not really trying to better their country. I think they just want us out, and that's it.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we went into this war with a lot of emotional baggage and a desire for revenge. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, at the time, somewhat understandable. We couldn't just let the attack go unpunished, but I do think we could have come up with a better plan. There was a lack of unity and a clear direction, which made things worse.\n\nIt's my honest opinion that we're not the ones to change those people. They're always going to be the way they are, and I don't think we're making enough progress to justify staying there. In fact, I believe that once we leave, everything will collapse, and we'll just be causing harm to ourselves by prolonging our stay. We can't stay there indefinitely, so it's better to just pull out and focus on our own issues."
