            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to reassess some of its views and consider adapting to more modern perspectives. It's no secret that the Church has been experiencing a decline in followers, and I think this is partly due to its inflexibility on certain issues. The Church has strong opinions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which might be too outdated for some people. \n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary approach, it might not lose its followers. I've noticed that many people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. Some individuals are starting to disagree with the Church's views on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, which might make them uncomfortable being part of a community that rejects their values.\n\nFor instance, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel at ease being part of a Church that views it as morally wrong. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage or have strong feelings about it might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share their views. I also think that allowing female priests or married priests wouldn't necessarily have prevented the Church's problems. It's uncertain whether this would have made a significant difference.\n\nHowever, I do believe that priests should be allowed to get married. The Church views priests as married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith, but this doesn't seem fair when compared to the rest of the world. Most people have a job and a family life, and I don't see why priests can't have the same balance. It's hypocritical to expect them to dedicate themselves completely to their work while everyone else is allowed to have a personal life.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on something, but I'm having a bit of trouble putting my thoughts into words. Anyway, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously decide on. I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nIt seems to me that it's unfair to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples while allowing opposite-sex couples to have that right. I haven't given it a lot of thought, but it just seems wrong to me. \n\nWhen you think about it, people's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born straight; others are born gay. It's not something they can control or be held responsible for. \n\nI think it's wrong for the government to get involved in matters like this, especially when it's not a matter of national security or moral values. It just seems like they're overstepping their bounds and sticking their noses into people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. They shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nTo be honest, I don't really think the federal government should have any say in the matter. It's not their business, and it's not something that affects the country's security or moral fabric. They're just being intrusive and interfering with people's personal lives. \n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it; it's a tough issue, but I think the government should stay out of it. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.  There's no valid reason not to.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not a fair argument.  It's apples and oranges - two different issues that aren't comparable.  The truth is, there are many aspects of gay relationships that are similar to those of heterosexual couples, and that's what counts.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to basic rights like property taxes and healthcare, a partner in a gay relationship is usually excluded from being present in the hospital or visiting if the other partner is sick.  This is just plain silly, especially given that many gay couples have the same rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.  It's all about the relationship itself, not the sex of the partners.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church; what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.  If the government allows civil unions, why not marriages?  It's segregation by another name - separate but unequal.\n\nThere are also concerns about adoption and community issues, like how gay couples will be perceived by their neighbors and how their children will adjust to society.  However, the truth is that the main drawback is how children are treated by their peers and other adults.  In some areas, like New York City, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nParents who protest to remove these children from their schools are missing the point - parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.  Ultimately, it's about personality choices, not the sexual orientation of the parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state.  The proposed amendment is a bad idea, and President Bush's stance on the issue, which is rooted in his personal religious views, doesn't reflect the views of the majority of Americans.  It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are also opposed to gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect.  However, this is simply not true, as the American Psychological Association has stated.  If we listened to research and studies on the subject instead of popular opinion, we might see things in a different light.",
            "Ugh, fine. I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and you know, just because something's off-limits doesn't mean it has zero redeeming qualities. I mean, take it or leave it, but as far as making it available to the general public, I'm a no. Absolutely not. However, when it comes to using it for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story altogether. It's not like just because something's outlawed, it's automatically useless. You get my point?\n\nAnyway, there are plenty of controlled substances we use at the pharmacy that are technically off-limits, like oxycodone, vicodin, or percs. They're all beneficial, despite being what you might call 'forbidden.' And if we're going to deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because of a social stigma, well, that's a pretty pointless stance in my opinion. I think we should acknowledge its benefits rather than dismissing them out of hand.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's exactly like alcohol in terms of abuse potential, because if you overdo it on marijuana, you might run into problems. But hey, we all know that excessive drinking can lead to some pretty nasty outcomes, too. It's a tough call, but I'd say we could try to approach marijuana legalization in a more gradual way, rather than a 'cold turkey' approach. If we'd just drop the whole taboo surrounding it, people might start using it more responsibly, and that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nPeople have this warped perception of marijuana because of its illicit status, but honestly, it's not like heroine or cocaine or anything else that's really bad for you. So, if we could just rebrand marijuana as something that's not inherently evil, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\nNot my problem, though.",
            "I think the church has definitely adapted to 21st-century standards.  It's not as rigid as it used to be, which I noticed even when I was younger.  For example, I used to go to church every Sunday as a kid, and I would always dress up in cute little outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse.  It was just part of the routine since I attended a private school and saw all my friends there on weekends.  However, as I've grown older, I've noticed that the church has introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually.  In the summer, people often show up in beach clothes, and it's not uncommon to see families rush in late.  Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis.  It's a more relaxed atmosphere, but still respectable.\n\nOne thing that stands out is how casual the church has become.  I don't know the politics behind the church's decisions, but that's my observation.  Moving on to the topic of accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think changing the rules, such as allowing female priests or married priests, would have prevented these incidents.  There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not because of their marital status.  It's an individual issue, and people can be drawn to children regardless of their marital status.\n\nI also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and it's not solely because of the rules that determine whether someone can get married.  In some denominations, like Seventh Heaven's type of faith, clergy are allowed to be married, and it's not a barrier to their faith.  If someone wants to be married and practice their faith, they might consider a different faith that allows it.  I'm not saying it would have made a difference in preventing pedophilia, but it's an alternative option.\n\nTo elaborate on my answer, I think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing.  I don't think it's a matter of choice, and trying to hide it through marriage wouldn't change the underlying issue.  It's a complex topic, and if the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's a different story.  However, I don't think they knew about all the cases.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "I have to admit, I was initially open to the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, and it seems like the invasion of Iraq was a pretext for other underlying reasons. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since become clear that these allegations were false. This really rubs me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still gets under my skin.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been dishonest with the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for its lies. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I think this kind of deceit is a serious offense, especially for a government official, and it's an impeachable crime.\n\nThe Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the Constitution and has been working to erode it since 9/11. It's clear they had a pre-existing intent to go to war, and it's possible that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. The real reason might have been to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to stop the war, but I'm also concerned that withdrawing troops now could lead to civil war and more casualties. The alternative being considered - a coalition of nearby countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia - might not be the best solution, as it would likely lead to more problems in the long run, including issues with Iraq's sovereignty. The current government is already ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the interim government is falling apart, and even the Prime Minister has little control over the situation. The radical elements in Iraq are still vying for power, and the political process is really struggling as a result. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm certainly not sure I can articulate it in polite conversation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not exactly sure where to start with my thoughts on the war in Iraq. To be frank, it all started to feel pointless to me, mainly because it wasn't officially declared as a war by Congress. It feels like we went in there in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq, so it seemed like a way to get back at them. But now, it's hard to keep up with all the details, and I think we're mainly staying there to try to build a democracy and get their oil.\n\nHowever, it's not a good reason to stay, as it's causing a lot of upset. If we stay, we'll have to try to establish a democracy, which will take forever and might even make things worse. On the other hand, if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up and having to start over. It's a tricky situation.\n\nI'm not exactly an expert on this topic, and I'm not sure what to think. I think we should stop calling it a war, though, because it wasn't officially declared as one. We're using force to show our power, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to stay.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources, and I feel bad for President Bush because of how it's turning out. It's making him look like one of the worst presidents in U.S. history, and it's causing a lot of problems for the people of Iraq. The whole Vietnam War thing comes to mind – it was an undeclared war and is now considered pointless. I'm worried that this will be remembered as another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard for me to say that I want the war to end, though, because I know families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. However, the situation there is complicated, and I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into a second U.S. and make things worse. The different groups in Iraq are killing each other over their beliefs, and it's creating an unsafe environment. On the other hand, if we leave, it might allow these groups to grow and create more hatred towards the U.S.\n\nIt's all a bit of a mess, and I think this whole thing will drag on for years to come. I'm not sure what the solution is, but it's a complex issue that needs to be carefully considered.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for a government to make it legal or even declare it as lawful. In my opinion, it's more up to the churches to decide, considering the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that any attempt to enforce authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established in the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we've seen, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't prohibit or permit.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend this would be contradictory to what's already in place and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I strongly disagree with that approach.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why the president is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own Catholic beliefs. By doing so, he's essentially showing a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or the government. There's no valid reason to support this amendment, as it seems to be driven by personal views rather than any tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society.\n\nI think I've covered the main points.",
            "Well, I haven't been posting about my thoughts on the Iraq war, but I think it's time to share my views. To be honest, I'm not convinced that the government was entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it's not that clear-cut. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. The fact that so many American soldiers have died in Iraq is heartbreaking, and it's clear that they were removing the Iraqi government without considering the consequences.\n\nThe US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, leading to chaos and power vacuums that are still ongoing. They're trying to implement a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process. The US government should have known better, given their past experiences, that it wouldn't be a clear-cut victory.\n\nIt's hard to abandon a country once you've intervened, especially when you've taken away their government and way of life. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the cost of keeping troops in Iraq for an extended period make it a difficult decision to continue. If the real reason for invading Iraq was to bring democracy, why not do the same for other countries? I believe the real reasons are more about oil and controlling resources, as evidenced by the lack of action against countries like North Korea, which has admitted to having weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon, and there's peace in the region. However, based on the current situation, it's unlikely.",
            "Okay, so I'm trying to gather my thoughts about gay marriage - something I've been strongly in favor of for a while now. It seems to me that whether someone is gay or straight is largely a matter of personal preference, and studies have increasingly shown that it's linked to biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI don't think the government or politics should have a say in this, it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families. I know of a few openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they're just like any other family - they take care of their daily tasks and live their lives like everyone else. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch has shown that there may be a chemical basis for homosexuality, suggesting it's not something you're born into due to your upbringing or environment. It's a complex issue, but it's clear that biology plays a role. I've read numerous articles and reports that support this idea.\n\nEssentially, it comes down to the fact that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately and quietly, but if two gay people try to do the same, it's a public spectacle. I think marriage should be a personal, private matter, not something subject to public scrutiny or federal regulation.",
            "honestly, i'm not even sure where to start with this \n   when you put something online, it's a public forum - completely open to the public eye \n   as an RA, i've already dealt with this issue firsthand \n   the thing is, once you post something online, you can't control how others will perceive you \n   especially when it comes to sensitive topics like violence or shootings \n   someone's bound to take it seriously and share it with others \n   and once that happens, it's out of your hands \n   the internet is a vast, global platform, and what you post can be seen by anyone \n   if you're connected with that person on social media, they'll likely receive the post \n   in this case, it wasn't the school that received the bulletin - it was someone who overheard something and took it to the authorities \n   they can't just ignore it, as they have a responsibility to act on potential threats \n   the problem is, it can be hard to distinguish between genuine threats and pranks or experiments gone wrong \n   like that one time we had at school, where a student's post was misinterpreted \n   it could be a joke, or it could be a serious warning sign \n   in this particular case, a friend of the person in question checked their social media profile and became concerned about certain posts \n   these posts were initially meant as jokes, but took on a different meaning in light of the situation \n   the thing is, when you post something online, you lose control over who sees it and how they interpret it \n   there's no such thing as true online privacy - if you don't want something out there, don't post it \n   you can't dictate what others think or how they'll react \n   and as for school officials friending students on social media, i don't think that's a good idea \n   they should focus on monitoring situations that are brought to their attention, not constantly scouring social media for potential issues \n   if a student or parent reports something, that's a different story - then the school has a responsibility to investigate \n   but they shouldn't be actively searching through social media accounts without a legitimate reason \n   as an RA, i can attest to this - it's not my job to police my residents' online activities, and i don't want to know about them if i can help it \n   that's why i wouldn't friend them on social media - it's not my place to know that kind of information",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for way too long. Initially, I believed the purpose was sound - to bring democracy to a country without a fair system. But over time, it seems we've lost sight of that goal. It's possible we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world we're a superpower. My concern is that the original motivations may have been suspect, given George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the war's purpose was truly to bring democracy, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective within the first few months. The fact that the war has been ongoing for years, draining our resources and lives, makes it far too prolonged.\n\nI genuinely believe our original purpose was noble, and that's why I initially supported the war. Unfortunately, I think our reasons have become distorted and misguided. It seems we're now fighting for the sake of war itself, rather than for a meaningful outcome. We don't want to end the war without a clear victory, but I think that time has passed.\n\nThe war has dragged on for far too long, and it's time to bring it to a close. The Iraqi government will have to fend for itself eventually, and I believe that time has come. We're diverting billions of dollars from our economy, which could be better spent on domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. These problems are far more pressing and deserving of our attention.\n\nIt's alarming to see our money being spent on a war that's lost its original purpose. We have our own internal struggles to address, and it's not wise to prioritize a foreign conflict over our own domestic challenges. The lives of our own citizens are being lost in this conflict, and it's time to reassess our priorities.\n\nThat's my take on the situation.",
            "I wanted to ask a question to clear something up. I understand that someone on the internet found that there was a reason for something not happening, but I'm not sure what that reason was. \n\nOn sites like Myspace, you know, you can share a lot of information about yourself, and that information is available to anyone who can view your profile. Even if you need someone else to be a member to see your profile, you've essentially given them permission to see it by accepting them as a friend. So, it's kind of like you have to expect that a lot of people will see whatever you put on the internet.\n\nI think it's actually a good thing that someone saw something that might have prevented a life from being lost, though. I can understand why it might be tough for someone to monitor all of the profiles on a school's Myspace, but it's not really fair to single out certain students based on their online activity. It's a tricky situation because you can't just have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles, but at the same time, it's not right to discriminate against certain people.\n\nI don't really know how to balance it all out. I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see things about me that I might not want them to see. I've seen this guy on TV who was trying to show how easy it is for people to get information about others online, and it's kind of scary. He got a girl's screen name in just a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. I wouldn't meet with someone I didn't know in person, but I do have people in my classes who know my screen name and can contact me. It's hard to know who's really looking at your information and what they're doing with it.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but at the same time, I don't want to limit it too much because I use it to communicate with friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. I only accept people I know as friends, but I'm not really sure who else can see my information. My roommate was telling me about a time when her high school banned students from having Myspace, and I wasn't really sure how the school officials had the right to make that decision.",
            "I'm hesitant to bring up the Iraq War again, but I feel like it's worth discussing one more time. To be honest, I'm not sure I should be joining the chorus of people who claim they were against the war from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The majority of people everywhere, including the administration, have realized that the war was a bad idea. If we look at recent polls, it's clear that the overwhelming consensus is that the war was a mistake. In fact, polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a bad idea. Even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, around 70%, believe that the war was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. It's little wonder, considering the war has been a disaster from the start. The issue is that there's a huge cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern nations, making it difficult for the US to understand the local culture. The idea that we can impose democracy on a region where it may not be the preferred system is simplistic and misguided. While Saddam was undoubtedly a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. The situation in Iraq has become like quicksand, and I'm not sure what to say about it. Honestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq. I'm skeptical of the administration's claims that staying is beneficial and that problems will arise if we withdraw. I'm yet to hear a legitimate argument for why we should remain in Iraq beyond what's necessary to ensure a safe withdrawal. If the administration wants to pull out gradually, I'm not opposed to that. However, I don't see a compelling reason for us to stay any longer than necessary. What's striking is that, according to statistics, around 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective, and it's possible that they know better than us. By asking them if we should leave and they say yes, we can avoid being blamed if things go wrong. If we do decide to help after that, at least we'll be seen as the good guys – well, as good as we can be in the Middle East.",
            "To be honest, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. I mean, it's not just about women, though. I believe it's more about the specific field someone works in. For instance, even in industries where equality is supposed to be the norm, it can be tough for people to overcome the ingrained biases that have been built up over time. Think about it: most people still struggle to see past the \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from working under a woman. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long, perpetuating the idea that men are the ones in charge.\n\nAs a result, women often feel like they have to work twice as hard to prove themselves. They might have all the qualifications for a promotion, but if they're not part of the traditional upper echelons of a company, they might not get the nod. It's the same issue in other industries, like fashion or caregiving. It's rare to see men taking on the role of primary caregiver, and when they do, society often frowns upon it. People assume that men should be the breadwinners, not the ones staying home with the kids.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's even more complicated. If a man is interested in fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume he's not a \"real\" fashion expert. I mean, typically men who are into fashion have a certain style, and if someone who doesn't fit that mold tries to join the industry, people might wonder if they really know what they're talking about.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though. People from different backgrounds can face discrimination too. For example, if someone grew up on a farm and didn't have the best education, but they're intelligent and work their way up to a high-level position, others might doubt their abilities because of their background. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you speak. So, I think that depending on the field and the individual, there's definitely still a lot of gender (and other forms of) discrimination in the US.\n\nChanging this is tough, though. Society has a set mindset, and it's hard to shift away from that. We've made progress, obviously - women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world - but it's a slow process. As people see more women in leadership positions and stay-at-home dads becoming more common, they're starting to accept it more. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, but change takes time, and we've come a long way already.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it completely legal, but rather decriminalized it. Decriminalization essentially downgrades it from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket - something you get cited for, rather than arrested and booked. This is a big deal for people, especially when it comes to job interviews and other future endeavors, because it's the worst part of having a drug charge. \n\nHowever, there's an argument that it's expensive to arrest and prosecute people, and then let them go. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and have them appear in court multiple times. Plus, there's the cost of public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office. For cash-strapped municipalities, it's hard to justify this expense, even if it would free up money for other important programs. \n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, seems to be okay with decriminalization. They might actually have more money to spend on things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless now. It's a big deal because marijuana isn't something you want to see everywhere, for a variety of reasons. There's a financial element to consider, as well as societal factors. \n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could become like cigarettes - sold in gas stations and consumed everywhere. Some people might be worried about it being a major issue, especially with driving and smoking. It's still taboo in many places, and having it out in the open like that could be awkward for a lot of people. \n\nAlcohol has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. It's hard to generalize about substances, because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, while others can't. It's complicated, and I think both substances have their own set of problems.",
            "I'd have to agree \nThe thing is, a lot of the methods they use have been around for ages \nThey stick to traditional practices, which is good in some ways \nBut it's also essential to be open to change \nMany people within the Catholic Church believe in attending church services every week \nHowever, the Church can be pretty strict about how things are done \nSometimes, it seems like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow their doctrine to the letter \nThey also don't always accept those who don't share their exact beliefs \nFor instance, my parents were both raised in different Christian denominations, and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's background \n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church teaches the importance of loving others, but then doesn't always put that into practice \nThis can come across as hypocritical when you consider their stance on other religions \nI think it's a matter of outdated doctrine that contradicts the actual practice \nThey continue to stick with the old ways, even if they're no longer relevant \n\nI don't think being allowed to marry would necessarily change the behavior of priests who engage in pedophilia \nAs I see it, the issue lies in the power dynamic between the priest and the child, not in their marital status \nIt's not like someone who would abuse a child would suddenly change their ways just because they're married \n\nThose who abuse children tend to do so regardless of their marital status \nIt's the relationship between the abuser and the victim that's the problem, not their marital situation \nSo, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these issues from occurring",
            "I'm still weighing my thoughts on this complex issue, and to be honest, I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong yet. The debate surrounding the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a real brain-twister. It's a delicate matter, and I can see why people might get tripped up trying to navigate it without offending anyone.\n\nFor me, the question of whether marriage should be defined by the government is a tough one. Marriage is often considered a sacred institution, and yet, people who get married don't necessarily receive special treatment from the government just because of their faith. If two people get baptized, for instance, they don't automatically receive tax breaks or other government benefits. It's a similar situation with marriage - it's essentially a civil union, a union between two consenting adults.\n\nI think the government should just focus on recognizing civil unions, rather than trying to define what kind of marriage they are. After all, it's about two individuals coming together in a commitment to each other, not about the specific details of their relationship. The fact that same-sex couples are seeking the same rights as everyone else is a no-brainer - they're just looking for a civil union, just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement on this, it should be made a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a cause that's not significant enough to warrant changing the constitution. The constitution should only be amended for truly fundamental reasons, not for something that affects a relatively small group of people.\n\nTo put it simply, banning gay marriage isn't worth amending the constitution. I'm afraid I'm not on board with that idea.",
            "to be honest, i was raised in a conservative christian household, and as such, homosexuality has always been somewhat of a complicated issue for me.  i have a lot of gay friends, which has definitely broadened my perspective, but at the same time, i still don't fully agree with that lifestyle choice.  however, i do think it should be legalized, but not because it's a federal issue.  i believe it should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves.  after all, different states have different political leanings - some are more liberal, while others are more conservative.  if you're living in a state that leans democratic, it's likely that they'll push for gay marriage, and if you're not comfortable with that, perhaps you should consider moving to a state with different values.  still, i think that people of all orientations should have the same rights and opportunities, so i think it should be legalized state-by-state. \n\nas for the federal government, i don't think it's right for the president to impose their views on the entire country.  take bush, for example - just because he's in office, it doesn't mean he gets to dictate how every state should handle gay marriage.  that's a decision for the states to make, not the president.  and let's be real, he'll be out of office in a few years, so it's not like he'll have to live with the consequences of his decisions.  in the end, i think each state should be free to make their own decisions, without the president's interference.",
            "Honestly, I'd love to dive into this topic, but to be honest, I'm not quite sure where to start. Myspace, as a public platform, is essentially a bulletin board for people to share their thoughts and experiences with others. If you consider that definition, it's pretty clear that anything posted online is visible to the public, including school officials. Whether or not they're accessing it under the school's name, they could still find it through their personal computers at home.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials use online platforms like Myspace to prevent potential threats, such as school shootings, then I think it's perfectly reasonable. After all, it's their responsibility to ensure student safety, and if that means monitoring online activity, then so be it. I mean, think about it - if they're checking the internet to see if students are engaging in activities they shouldn't be, they're doing it specifically to prevent trouble and catch potential issues.\n\nNow, I'm not saying I agree with the idea of invading students' privacy, but if it saves lives and makes the school a safer place, then I'm okay with it. It's not like they're snooping through personal emails or messages; they're just looking at public content. And let's be real, once something's online, it's there forever, so it's not like you can take it back.\n\nI think it's pretty ridiculous for students to expect to post whatever they want online without facing any consequences. I mean, we're all worried about saying something we might regret in an email or message, aren't we? And even if we think we're anonymous, there's always a chance that someone will see it and use it against us.\n\nIt's a bit like this: if you do something in college that gets you into trouble later on, there's no way to get out of it. Once it's online, it's there forever. And I'm not saying I think it's an invasion of privacy just because school officials are monitoring online activity. I mean, like I said before, it's a public thing.\n\nI'm not saying that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to prevent a school shooting, then that's a different story. It's like what my teacher from public high school told me - they have to ensure the school is safe, and that means monitoring online activity.\n\nIt's kind of like during the terrorist attacks; we had to be safe, so we did lockdown drills and stuff. And while that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's kind of similar. They're just trying to prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's basically all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I've been struggling to express my thoughts on the war, and it's been a long time coming. At first, I was all for it after 9/11, as I was personally affected, and I thought we should go in there and create chaos just like they did here. However, I think we overlooked the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nI believe we went in there unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately backfired. I was initially in favor of the war, but now I'm strongly against it. I don't think it's achieved anything. The people over there are so consumed by their own internal conflicts that they can't even fight us effectively. It's a waste of our time and resources to be there.\n\nTo be honest, I've become somewhat desensitized to what's happening over there due to 9/11. I just don't care about the situation anymore. At times, I find it hard to see the Iraqis as human beings because they're so focused on fighting each other. I think we went in there with a simplistic idea of how to solve their problems, but it's not that easy.\n\nWar is a completely different beast in Iraq than it is for us. They have a much more brutal approach to conflict, and I don't think they're interested in improving their country; they just want us out. I think we should just leave and be done with it.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were more driven by revenge and a desire to \"do something\" after 9/11, rather than thinking through the potential consequences. President Bush seemed to take it upon himself to declare war on Iraq, and I understand where he was coming from, but I don't think we had a choice. However, I do think we could have planned better and had a clearer idea of what we were trying to achieve.\n\nLack of unity and a clear plan have hindered our efforts. We didn't have a clear understanding of what we wanted to accomplish, and we didn't prepare for the aftermath. I think that's what ultimately led to the mess we're in.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the Iraqi people. They've always been that way, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify the cost. I believe we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq, and once we leave, the situation will likely collapse."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq

the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003

um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to reassess some of its views and consider adapting to more modern perspectives. It's no secret that the Church has been experiencing a decline in followers, and I think this is partly due to its inflexibility on certain issues. The Church has strong opinions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which might be too outdated for some people. \n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary approach, it might not lose its followers. I've noticed that many people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. Some individuals are starting to disagree with the Church's views on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, which might make them uncomfortable being part of a community that rejects their values.\n\nFor instance, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel at ease being part of a Church that views it as morally wrong. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage or have strong feelings about it might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share their views. I also think that allowing female priests or married priests wouldn't necessarily have prevented the Church's problems. It's uncertain whether this would have made a significant difference.\n\nHowever, I do believe that priests should be allowed to get married. The Church views priests as married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith, but this doesn't seem fair when compared to the rest of the world. Most people have a job and a family life, and I don't see why priests can't have the same balance. It's hypocritical to expect them to dedicate themselves completely to their work while everyone else is allowed to have a personal life.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on something, but I'm having a bit of trouble putting my thoughts into words. Anyway, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously decide on. I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nIt seems to me that it's unfair to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples while allowing opposite-sex couples to have that right. I haven't given it a lot of thought, but it just seems wrong to me. \n\nWhen you think about it, people's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born straight; others are born gay. It's not something they can control or be held responsible for. \n\nI think it's wrong for the government to get involved in matters like this, especially when it's not a matter of national security or moral values. It just seems like they're overstepping their bounds and sticking their noses into people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. They shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nTo be honest, I don't really think the federal government should have any say in the matter. It's not their business, and it's not something that affects the country's security or moral fabric. They're just being intrusive and interfering with people's personal lives. \n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it; it's a tough issue, but I think the government should stay out of it. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.  There's no valid reason not to.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not a fair argument.  It's apples and oranges - two different issues that aren't comparable.  The truth is, there are many aspects of gay relationships that are similar to those of heterosexual couples, and that's what counts.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to basic rights like property taxes and healthcare, a partner in a gay relationship is usually excluded from being present in the hospital or visiting if the other partner is sick.  This is just plain silly, especially given that many gay couples have the same rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.  It's all about the relationship itself, not the sex of the partners.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church; what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.  If the government allows civil unions, why not marriages?  It's segregation by another name - separate but unequal.\n\nThere are also concerns about adoption and community issues, like how gay couples will be perceived by their neighbors and how their children will adjust to society.  However, the truth is that the main drawback is how children are treated by their peers and other adults.  In some areas, like New York City, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nParents who protest to remove these children from their schools are missing the point - parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.  Ultimately, it's about personality choices, not the sexual orientation of the parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state.  The proposed amendment is a bad idea, and President Bush's stance on the issue, which is rooted in his personal religious views, doesn't reflect the views of the majority of Americans.  It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are also opposed to gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect.  However, this is simply not true, as the American Psychological Association has stated.  If we listened to research and studies on the subject instead of popular opinion, we might see things in a different light.",
            "Ugh, fine. I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and you know, just because something's off-limits doesn't mean it has zero redeeming qualities. I mean, take it or leave it, but as far as making it available to the general public, I'm a no. Absolutely not. However, when it comes to using it for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story altogether. It's not like just because something's outlawed, it's automatically useless. You get my point?\n\nAnyway, there are plenty of controlled substances we use at the pharmacy that are technically off-limits, like oxycodone, vicodin, or percs. They're all beneficial, despite being what you might call 'forbidden.' And if we're going to deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because of a social stigma, well, that's a pretty pointless stance in my opinion. I think we should acknowledge its benefits rather than dismissing them out of hand.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's exactly like alcohol in terms of abuse potential, because if you overdo it on marijuana, you might run into problems. But hey, we all know that excessive drinking can lead to some pretty nasty outcomes, too. It's a tough call, but I'd say we could try to approach marijuana legalization in a more gradual way, rather than a 'cold turkey' approach. If we'd just drop the whole taboo surrounding it, people might start using it more responsibly, and that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nPeople have this warped perception of marijuana because of its illicit status, but honestly, it's not like heroine or cocaine or anything else that's really bad for you. So, if we could just rebrand marijuana as something that's not inherently evil, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\nNot my problem, though.",
            "I think the church has definitely adapted to 21st-century standards.  It's not as rigid as it used to be, which I noticed even when I was younger.  For example, I used to go to church every Sunday as a kid, and I would always dress up in cute little outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse.  It was just part of the routine since I attended a private school and saw all my friends there on weekends.  However, as I've grown older, I've noticed that the church has introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually.  In the summer, people often show up in beach clothes, and it's not uncommon to see families rush in late.  Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis.  It's a more relaxed atmosphere, but still respectable.\n\nOne thing that stands out is how casual the church has become.  I don't know the politics behind the church's decisions, but that's my observation.  Moving on to the topic of accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think changing the rules, such as allowing female priests or married priests, would have prevented these incidents.  There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not because of their marital status.  It's an individual issue, and people can be drawn to children regardless of their marital status.\n\nI also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and it's not solely because of the rules that determine whether someone can get married.  In some denominations, like Seventh Heaven's type of faith, clergy are allowed to be married, and it's not a barrier to their faith.  If someone wants to be married and practice their faith, they might consider a different faith that allows it.  I'm not saying it would have made a difference in preventing pedophilia, but it's an alternative option.\n\nTo elaborate on my answer, I think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing.  I don't think it's a matter of choice, and trying to hide it through marriage wouldn't change the underlying issue.  It's a complex topic, and if the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's a different story.  However, I don't think they knew about all the cases.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "I have to admit, I was initially open to the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, and it seems like the invasion of Iraq was a pretext for other underlying reasons. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since become clear that these allegations were false. This really rubs me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still gets under my skin.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been dishonest with the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for its lies. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I think this kind of deceit is a serious offense, especially for a government official, and it's an impeachable crime.\n\nThe Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the Constitution and has been working to erode it since 9/11. It's clear they had a pre-existing intent to go to war, and it's possible that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. The real reason might have been to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to stop the war, but I'm also concerned that withdrawing troops now could lead to civil war and more casualties. The alternative being considered - a coalition of nearby countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia - might not be the best solution, as it would likely lead to more problems in the long run, including issues with Iraq's sovereignty. The current government is already ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the interim government is falling apart, and even the Prime Minister has little control over the situation. The radical elements in Iraq are still vying for power, and the political process is really struggling as a result. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm certainly not sure I can articulate it in polite conversation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not exactly sure where to start with my thoughts on the war in Iraq. To be frank, it all started to feel pointless to me, mainly because it wasn't officially declared as a war by Congress. It feels like we went in there in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq, so it seemed like a way to get back at them. But now, it's hard to keep up with all the details, and I think we're mainly staying there to try to build a democracy and get their oil.\n\nHowever, it's not a good reason to stay, as it's causing a lot of upset. If we stay, we'll have to try to establish a democracy, which will take forever and might even make things worse. On the other hand, if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up and having to start over. It's a tricky situation.\n\nI'm not exactly an expert on this topic, and I'm not sure what to think. I think we should stop calling it a war, though, because it wasn't officially declared as one. We're using force to show our power, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to stay.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources, and I feel bad for President Bush because of how it's turning out. It's making him look like one of the worst presidents in U.S. history, and it's causing a lot of problems for the people of Iraq. The whole Vietnam War thing comes to mind – it was an undeclared war and is now considered pointless. I'm worried that this will be remembered as another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard for me to say that I want the war to end, though, because I know families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. However, the situation there is complicated, and I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into a second U.S. and make things worse. The different groups in Iraq are killing each other over their beliefs, and it's creating an unsafe environment. On the other hand, if we leave, it might allow these groups to grow and create more hatred towards the U.S.\n\nIt's all a bit of a mess, and I think this whole thing will drag on for years to come. I'm not sure what the solution is, but it's a complex issue that needs to be carefully considered.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for a government to make it legal or even declare it as lawful. In my opinion, it's more up to the churches to decide, considering the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that any attempt to enforce authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established in the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we've seen, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't prohibit or permit.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend this would be contradictory to what's already in place and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I strongly disagree with that approach.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why the president is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own Catholic beliefs. By doing so, he's essentially showing a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or the government. There's no valid reason to support this amendment, as it seems to be driven by personal views rather than any tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society.\n\nI think I've covered the main points.",
            "Well, I haven't been posting about my thoughts on the Iraq war, but I think it's time to share my views. To be honest, I'm not convinced that the government was entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it's not that clear-cut. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. The fact that so many American soldiers have died in Iraq is heartbreaking, and it's clear that they were removing the Iraqi government without considering the consequences.\n\nThe US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, leading to chaos and power vacuums that are still ongoing. They're trying to implement a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process. The US government should have known better, given their past experiences, that it wouldn't be a clear-cut victory.\n\nIt's hard to abandon a country once you've intervened, especially when you've taken away their government and way of life. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the cost of keeping troops in Iraq for an extended period make it a difficult decision to continue. If the real reason for invading Iraq was to bring democracy, why not do the same for other countries? I believe the real reasons are more about oil and controlling resources, as evidenced by the lack of action against countries like North Korea, which has admitted to having weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon, and there's peace in the region. However, based on the current situation, it's unlikely.",
            "Okay, so I'm trying to gather my thoughts about gay marriage - something I've been strongly in favor of for a while now. It seems to me that whether someone is gay or straight is largely a matter of personal preference, and studies have increasingly shown that it's linked to biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI don't think the government or politics should have a say in this, it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families. I know of a few openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they're just like any other family - they take care of their daily tasks and live their lives like everyone else. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch has shown that there may be a chemical basis for homosexuality, suggesting it's not something you're born into due to your upbringing or environment. It's a complex issue, but it's clear that biology plays a role. I've read numerous articles and reports that support this idea.\n\nEssentially, it comes down to the fact that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately and quietly, but if two gay people try to do the same, it's a public spectacle. I think marriage should be a personal, private matter, not something subject to public scrutiny or federal regulation.",
            "honestly, i'm not even sure where to start with this \n   when you put something online, it's a public forum - completely open to the public eye \n   as an RA, i've already dealt with this issue firsthand \n   the thing is, once you post something online, you can't control how others will perceive you \n   especially when it comes to sensitive topics like violence or shootings \n   someone's bound to take it seriously and share it with others \n   and once that happens, it's out of your hands \n   the internet is a vast, global platform, and what you post can be seen by anyone \n   if you're connected with that person on social media, they'll likely receive the post \n   in this case, it wasn't the school that received the bulletin - it was someone who overheard something and took it to the authorities \n   they can't just ignore it, as they have a responsibility to act on potential threats \n   the problem is, it can be hard to distinguish between genuine threats and pranks or experiments gone wrong \n   like that one time we had at school, where a student's post was misinterpreted \n   it could be a joke, or it could be a serious warning sign \n   in this particular case, a friend of the person in question checked their social media profile and became concerned about certain posts \n   these posts were initially meant as jokes, but took on a different meaning in light of the situation \n   the thing is, when you post something online, you lose control over who sees it and how they interpret it \n   there's no such thing as true online privacy - if you don't want something out there, don't post it \n   you can't dictate what others think or how they'll react \n   and as for school officials friending students on social media, i don't think that's a good idea \n   they should focus on monitoring situations that are brought to their attention, not constantly scouring social media for potential issues \n   if a student or parent reports something, that's a different story - then the school has a responsibility to investigate \n   but they shouldn't be actively searching through social media accounts without a legitimate reason \n   as an RA, i can attest to this - it's not my job to police my residents' online activities, and i don't want to know about them if i can help it \n   that's why i wouldn't friend them on social media - it's not my place to know that kind of information",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for way too long. Initially, I believed the purpose was sound - to bring democracy to a country without a fair system. But over time, it seems we've lost sight of that goal. It's possible we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world we're a superpower. My concern is that the original motivations may have been suspect, given George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the war's purpose was truly to bring democracy, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective within the first few months. The fact that the war has been ongoing for years, draining our resources and lives, makes it far too prolonged.\n\nI genuinely believe our original purpose was noble, and that's why I initially supported the war. Unfortunately, I think our reasons have become distorted and misguided. It seems we're now fighting for the sake of war itself, rather than for a meaningful outcome. We don't want to end the war without a clear victory, but I think that time has passed.\n\nThe war has dragged on for far too long, and it's time to bring it to a close. The Iraqi government will have to fend for itself eventually, and I believe that time has come. We're diverting billions of dollars from our economy, which could be better spent on domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. These problems are far more pressing and deserving of our attention.\n\nIt's alarming to see our money being spent on a war that's lost its original purpose. We have our own internal struggles to address, and it's not wise to prioritize a foreign conflict over our own domestic challenges. The lives of our own citizens are being lost in this conflict, and it's time to reassess our priorities.\n\nThat's my take on the situation.",
            "I wanted to ask a question to clear something up. I understand that someone on the internet found that there was a reason for something not happening, but I'm not sure what that reason was. \n\nOn sites like Myspace, you know, you can share a lot of information about yourself, and that information is available to anyone who can view your profile. Even if you need someone else to be a member to see your profile, you've essentially given them permission to see it by accepting them as a friend. So, it's kind of like you have to expect that a lot of people will see whatever you put on the internet.\n\nI think it's actually a good thing that someone saw something that might have prevented a life from being lost, though. I can understand why it might be tough for someone to monitor all of the profiles on a school's Myspace, but it's not really fair to single out certain students based on their online activity. It's a tricky situation because you can't just have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles, but at the same time, it's not right to discriminate against certain people.\n\nI don't really know how to balance it all out. I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see things about me that I might not want them to see. I've seen this guy on TV who was trying to show how easy it is for people to get information about others online, and it's kind of scary. He got a girl's screen name in just a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. I wouldn't meet with someone I didn't know in person, but I do have people in my classes who know my screen name and can contact me. It's hard to know who's really looking at your information and what they're doing with it.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but at the same time, I don't want to limit it too much because I use it to communicate with friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. I only accept people I know as friends, but I'm not really sure who else can see my information. My roommate was telling me about a time when her high school banned students from having Myspace, and I wasn't really sure how the school officials had the right to make that decision.",
            "I'm hesitant to bring up the Iraq War again, but I feel like it's worth discussing one more time. To be honest, I'm not sure I should be joining the chorus of people who claim they were against the war from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The majority of people everywhere, including the administration, have realized that the war was a bad idea. If we look at recent polls, it's clear that the overwhelming consensus is that the war was a mistake. In fact, polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a bad idea. Even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, around 70%, believe that the war was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. It's little wonder, considering the war has been a disaster from the start. The issue is that there's a huge cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern nations, making it difficult for the US to understand the local culture. The idea that we can impose democracy on a region where it may not be the preferred system is simplistic and misguided. While Saddam was undoubtedly a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. The situation in Iraq has become like quicksand, and I'm not sure what to say about it. Honestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq. I'm skeptical of the administration's claims that staying is beneficial and that problems will arise if we withdraw. I'm yet to hear a legitimate argument for why we should remain in Iraq beyond what's necessary to ensure a safe withdrawal. If the administration wants to pull out gradually, I'm not opposed to that. However, I don't see a compelling reason for us to stay any longer than necessary. What's striking is that, according to statistics, around 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective, and it's possible that they know better than us. By asking them if we should leave and they say yes, we can avoid being blamed if things go wrong. If we do decide to help after that, at least we'll be seen as the good guys – well, as good as we can be in the Middle East.",
            "To be honest, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. I mean, it's not just about women, though. I believe it's more about the specific field someone works in. For instance, even in industries where equality is supposed to be the norm, it can be tough for people to overcome the ingrained biases that have been built up over time. Think about it: most people still struggle to see past the \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from working under a woman. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long, perpetuating the idea that men are the ones in charge.\n\nAs a result, women often feel like they have to work twice as hard to prove themselves. They might have all the qualifications for a promotion, but if they're not part of the traditional upper echelons of a company, they might not get the nod. It's the same issue in other industries, like fashion or caregiving. It's rare to see men taking on the role of primary caregiver, and when they do, society often frowns upon it. People assume that men should be the breadwinners, not the ones staying home with the kids.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's even more complicated. If a man is interested in fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume he's not a \"real\" fashion expert. I mean, typically men who are into fashion have a certain style, and if someone who doesn't fit that mold tries to join the industry, people might wonder if they really know what they're talking about.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though. People from different backgrounds can face discrimination too. For example, if someone grew up on a farm and didn't have the best education, but they're intelligent and work their way up to a high-level position, others might doubt their abilities because of their background. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you speak. So, I think that depending on the field and the individual, there's definitely still a lot of gender (and other forms of) discrimination in the US.\n\nChanging this is tough, though. Society has a set mindset, and it's hard to shift away from that. We've made progress, obviously - women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world - but it's a slow process. As people see more women in leadership positions and stay-at-home dads becoming more common, they're starting to accept it more. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, but change takes time, and we've come a long way already.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it completely legal, but rather decriminalized it. Decriminalization essentially downgrades it from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket - something you get cited for, rather than arrested and booked. This is a big deal for people, especially when it comes to job interviews and other future endeavors, because it's the worst part of having a drug charge. \n\nHowever, there's an argument that it's expensive to arrest and prosecute people, and then let them go. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and have them appear in court multiple times. Plus, there's the cost of public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office. For cash-strapped municipalities, it's hard to justify this expense, even if it would free up money for other important programs. \n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, seems to be okay with decriminalization. They might actually have more money to spend on things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless now. It's a big deal because marijuana isn't something you want to see everywhere, for a variety of reasons. There's a financial element to consider, as well as societal factors. \n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could become like cigarettes - sold in gas stations and consumed everywhere. Some people might be worried about it being a major issue, especially with driving and smoking. It's still taboo in many places, and having it out in the open like that could be awkward for a lot of people. \n\nAlcohol has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. It's hard to generalize about substances, because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, while others can't. It's complicated, and I think both substances have their own set of problems.",
            "I'd have to agree \nThe thing is, a lot of the methods they use have been around for ages \nThey stick to traditional practices, which is good in some ways \nBut it's also essential to be open to change \nMany people within the Catholic Church believe in attending church services every week \nHowever, the Church can be pretty strict about how things are done \nSometimes, it seems like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow their doctrine to the letter \nThey also don't always accept those who don't share their exact beliefs \nFor instance, my parents were both raised in different Christian denominations, and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's background \n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church teaches the importance of loving others, but then doesn't always put that into practice \nThis can come across as hypocritical when you consider their stance on other religions \nI think it's a matter of outdated doctrine that contradicts the actual practice \nThey continue to stick with the old ways, even if they're no longer relevant \n\nI don't think being allowed to marry would necessarily change the behavior of priests who engage in pedophilia \nAs I see it, the issue lies in the power dynamic between the priest and the child, not in their marital status \nIt's not like someone who would abuse a child would suddenly change their ways just because they're married \n\nThose who abuse children tend to do so regardless of their marital status \nIt's the relationship between the abuser and the victim that's the problem, not their marital situation \nSo, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these issues from occurring",
            "I'm still weighing my thoughts on this complex issue, and to be honest, I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong yet. The debate surrounding the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a real brain-twister. It's a delicate matter, and I can see why people might get tripped up trying to navigate it without offending anyone.\n\nFor me, the question of whether marriage should be defined by the government is a tough one. Marriage is often considered a sacred institution, and yet, people who get married don't necessarily receive special treatment from the government just because of their faith. If two people get baptized, for instance, they don't automatically receive tax breaks or other government benefits. It's a similar situation with marriage - it's essentially a civil union, a union between two consenting adults.\n\nI think the government should just focus on recognizing civil unions, rather than trying to define what kind of marriage they are. After all, it's about two individuals coming together in a commitment to each other, not about the specific details of their relationship. The fact that same-sex couples are seeking the same rights as everyone else is a no-brainer - they're just looking for a civil union, just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement on this, it should be made a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a cause that's not significant enough to warrant changing the constitution. The constitution should only be amended for truly fundamental reasons, not for something that affects a relatively small group of people.\n\nTo put it simply, banning gay marriage isn't worth amending the constitution. I'm afraid I'm not on board with that idea.",
            "to be honest, i was raised in a conservative christian household, and as such, homosexuality has always been somewhat of a complicated issue for me.  i have a lot of gay friends, which has definitely broadened my perspective, but at the same time, i still don't fully agree with that lifestyle choice.  however, i do think it should be legalized, but not because it's a federal issue.  i believe it should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves.  after all, different states have different political leanings - some are more liberal, while others are more conservative.  if you're living in a state that leans democratic, it's likely that they'll push for gay marriage, and if you're not comfortable with that, perhaps you should consider moving to a state with different values.  still, i think that people of all orientations should have the same rights and opportunities, so i think it should be legalized state-by-state. \n\nas for the federal government, i don't think it's right for the president to impose their views on the entire country.  take bush, for example - just because he's in office, it doesn't mean he gets to dictate how every state should handle gay marriage.  that's a decision for the states to make, not the president.  and let's be real, he'll be out of office in a few years, so it's not like he'll have to live with the consequences of his decisions.  in the end, i think each state should be free to make their own decisions, without the president's interference.",
            "Honestly, I'd love to dive into this topic, but to be honest, I'm not quite sure where to start. Myspace, as a public platform, is essentially a bulletin board for people to share their thoughts and experiences with others. If you consider that definition, it's pretty clear that anything posted online is visible to the public, including school officials. Whether or not they're accessing it under the school's name, they could still find it through their personal computers at home.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials use online platforms like Myspace to prevent potential threats, such as school shootings, then I think it's perfectly reasonable. After all, it's their responsibility to ensure student safety, and if that means monitoring online activity, then so be it. I mean, think about it - if they're checking the internet to see if students are engaging in activities they shouldn't be, they're doing it specifically to prevent trouble and catch potential issues.\n\nNow, I'm not saying I agree with the idea of invading students' privacy, but if it saves lives and makes the school a safer place, then I'm okay with it. It's not like they're snooping through personal emails or messages; they're just looking at public content. And let's be real, once something's online, it's there forever, so it's not like you can take it back.\n\nI think it's pretty ridiculous for students to expect to post whatever they want online without facing any consequences. I mean, we're all worried about saying something we might regret in an email or message, aren't we? And even if we think we're anonymous, there's always a chance that someone will see it and use it against us.\n\nIt's a bit like this: if you do something in college that gets you into trouble later on, there's no way to get out of it. Once it's online, it's there forever. And I'm not saying I think it's an invasion of privacy just because school officials are monitoring online activity. I mean, like I said before, it's a public thing.\n\nI'm not saying that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to prevent a school shooting, then that's a different story. It's like what my teacher from public high school told me - they have to ensure the school is safe, and that means monitoring online activity.\n\nIt's kind of like during the terrorist attacks; we had to be safe, so we did lockdown drills and stuff. And while that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's kind of similar. They're just trying to prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's basically all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I've been struggling to express my thoughts on the war, and it's been a long time coming. At first, I was all for it after 9/11, as I was personally affected, and I thought we should go in there and create chaos just like they did here. However, I think we overlooked the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nI believe we went in there unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately backfired. I was initially in favor of the war, but now I'm strongly against it. I don't think it's achieved anything. The people over there are so consumed by their own internal conflicts that they can't even fight us effectively. It's a waste of our time and resources to be there.\n\nTo be honest, I've become somewhat desensitized to what's happening over there due to 9/11. I just don't care about the situation anymore. At times, I find it hard to see the Iraqis as human beings because they're so focused on fighting each other. I think we went in there with a simplistic idea of how to solve their problems, but it's not that easy.\n\nWar is a completely different beast in Iraq than it is for us. They have a much more brutal approach to conflict, and I don't think they're interested in improving their country; they just want us out. I think we should just leave and be done with it.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were more driven by revenge and a desire to \"do something\" after 9/11, rather than thinking through the potential consequences. President Bush seemed to take it upon himself to declare war on Iraq, and I understand where he was coming from, but I don't think we had a choice. However, I do think we could have planned better and had a clearer idea of what we were trying to achieve.\n\nLack of unity and a clear plan have hindered our efforts. We didn't have a clear understanding of what we wanted to accomplish, and we didn't prepare for the aftermath. I think that's what ultimately led to the mess we're in.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the Iraqi people. They've always been that way, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify the cost. I believe we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq, and once we leave, the situation will likely collapse."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to reassess some of its views and consider adapting to more modern perspectives. It's no secret that the Church has been experiencing a decline in followers, and I think this is partly due to its inflexibility on certain issues. The Church has strong opinions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which might be too outdated for some people. \n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary approach, it might not lose its followers. I've noticed that many people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. Some individuals are starting to disagree with the Church's views on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, which might make them uncomfortable being part of a community that rejects their values.\n\nFor instance, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel at ease being part of a Church that views it as morally wrong. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage or have strong feelings about it might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share their views. I also think that allowing female priests or married priests wouldn't necessarily have prevented the Church's problems. It's uncertain whether this would have made a significant difference.\n\nHowever, I do believe that priests should be allowed to get married. The Church views priests as married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith, but this doesn't seem fair when compared to the rest of the world. Most people have a job and a family life, and I don't see why priests can't have the same balance. It's hypocritical to expect them to dedicate themselves completely to their work while everyone else is allowed to have a personal life.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on something, but I'm having a bit of trouble putting my thoughts into words. Anyway, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously decide on. I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nIt seems to me that it's unfair to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples while allowing opposite-sex couples to have that right. I haven't given it a lot of thought, but it just seems wrong to me. \n\nWhen you think about it, people's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born straight; others are born gay. It's not something they can control or be held responsible for. \n\nI think it's wrong for the government to get involved in matters like this, especially when it's not a matter of national security or moral values. It just seems like they're overstepping their bounds and sticking their noses into people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. They shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nTo be honest, I don't really think the federal government should have any say in the matter. It's not their business, and it's not something that affects the country's security or moral fabric. They're just being intrusive and interfering with people's personal lives. \n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it; it's a tough issue, but I think the government should stay out of it. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.  There's no valid reason not to.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not a fair argument.  It's apples and oranges - two different issues that aren't comparable.  The truth is, there are many aspects of gay relationships that are similar to those of heterosexual couples, and that's what counts.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to basic rights like property taxes and healthcare, a partner in a gay relationship is usually excluded from being present in the hospital or visiting if the other partner is sick.  This is just plain silly, especially given that many gay couples have the same rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.  It's all about the relationship itself, not the sex of the partners.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church; what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.  If the government allows civil unions, why not marriages?  It's segregation by another name - separate but unequal.\n\nThere are also concerns about adoption and community issues, like how gay couples will be perceived by their neighbors and how their children will adjust to society.  However, the truth is that the main drawback is how children are treated by their peers and other adults.  In some areas, like New York City, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nParents who protest to remove these children from their schools are missing the point - parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.  Ultimately, it's about personality choices, not the sexual orientation of the parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state.  The proposed amendment is a bad idea, and President Bush's stance on the issue, which is rooted in his personal religious views, doesn't reflect the views of the majority of Americans.  It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are also opposed to gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect.  However, this is simply not true, as the American Psychological Association has stated.  If we listened to research and studies on the subject instead of popular opinion, we might see things in a different light.",
            "Ugh, fine. I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and you know, just because something's off-limits doesn't mean it has zero redeeming qualities. I mean, take it or leave it, but as far as making it available to the general public, I'm a no. Absolutely not. However, when it comes to using it for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story altogether. It's not like just because something's outlawed, it's automatically useless. You get my point?\n\nAnyway, there are plenty of controlled substances we use at the pharmacy that are technically off-limits, like oxycodone, vicodin, or percs. They're all beneficial, despite being what you might call 'forbidden.' And if we're going to deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because of a social stigma, well, that's a pretty pointless stance in my opinion. I think we should acknowledge its benefits rather than dismissing them out of hand.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's exactly like alcohol in terms of abuse potential, because if you overdo it on marijuana, you might run into problems. But hey, we all know that excessive drinking can lead to some pretty nasty outcomes, too. It's a tough call, but I'd say we could try to approach marijuana legalization in a more gradual way, rather than a 'cold turkey' approach. If we'd just drop the whole taboo surrounding it, people might start using it more responsibly, and that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nPeople have this warped perception of marijuana because of its illicit status, but honestly, it's not like heroine or cocaine or anything else that's really bad for you. So, if we could just rebrand marijuana as something that's not inherently evil, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\nNot my problem, though.",
            "I think the church has definitely adapted to 21st-century standards.  It's not as rigid as it used to be, which I noticed even when I was younger.  For example, I used to go to church every Sunday as a kid, and I would always dress up in cute little outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse.  It was just part of the routine since I attended a private school and saw all my friends there on weekends.  However, as I've grown older, I've noticed that the church has introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually.  In the summer, people often show up in beach clothes, and it's not uncommon to see families rush in late.  Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis.  It's a more relaxed atmosphere, but still respectable.\n\nOne thing that stands out is how casual the church has become.  I don't know the politics behind the church's decisions, but that's my observation.  Moving on to the topic of accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think changing the rules, such as allowing female priests or married priests, would have prevented these incidents.  There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not because of their marital status.  It's an individual issue, and people can be drawn to children regardless of their marital status.\n\nI also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and it's not solely because of the rules that determine whether someone can get married.  In some denominations, like Seventh Heaven's type of faith, clergy are allowed to be married, and it's not a barrier to their faith.  If someone wants to be married and practice their faith, they might consider a different faith that allows it.  I'm not saying it would have made a difference in preventing pedophilia, but it's an alternative option.\n\nTo elaborate on my answer, I think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing.  I don't think it's a matter of choice, and trying to hide it through marriage wouldn't change the underlying issue.  It's a complex topic, and if the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's a different story.  However, I don't think they knew about all the cases.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "I have to admit, I was initially open to the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, and it seems like the invasion of Iraq was a pretext for other underlying reasons. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since become clear that these allegations were false. This really rubs me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still gets under my skin.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been dishonest with the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for its lies. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I think this kind of deceit is a serious offense, especially for a government official, and it's an impeachable crime.\n\nThe Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the Constitution and has been working to erode it since 9/11. It's clear they had a pre-existing intent to go to war, and it's possible that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. The real reason might have been to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to stop the war, but I'm also concerned that withdrawing troops now could lead to civil war and more casualties. The alternative being considered - a coalition of nearby countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia - might not be the best solution, as it would likely lead to more problems in the long run, including issues with Iraq's sovereignty. The current government is already ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the interim government is falling apart, and even the Prime Minister has little control over the situation. The radical elements in Iraq are still vying for power, and the political process is really struggling as a result. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm certainly not sure I can articulate it in polite conversation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not exactly sure where to start with my thoughts on the war in Iraq. To be frank, it all started to feel pointless to me, mainly because it wasn't officially declared as a war by Congress. It feels like we went in there in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq, so it seemed like a way to get back at them. But now, it's hard to keep up with all the details, and I think we're mainly staying there to try to build a democracy and get their oil.\n\nHowever, it's not a good reason to stay, as it's causing a lot of upset. If we stay, we'll have to try to establish a democracy, which will take forever and might even make things worse. On the other hand, if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up and having to start over. It's a tricky situation.\n\nI'm not exactly an expert on this topic, and I'm not sure what to think. I think we should stop calling it a war, though, because it wasn't officially declared as one. We're using force to show our power, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to stay.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources, and I feel bad for President Bush because of how it's turning out. It's making him look like one of the worst presidents in U.S. history, and it's causing a lot of problems for the people of Iraq. The whole Vietnam War thing comes to mind – it was an undeclared war and is now considered pointless. I'm worried that this will be remembered as another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard for me to say that I want the war to end, though, because I know families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. However, the situation there is complicated, and I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into a second U.S. and make things worse. The different groups in Iraq are killing each other over their beliefs, and it's creating an unsafe environment. On the other hand, if we leave, it might allow these groups to grow and create more hatred towards the U.S.\n\nIt's all a bit of a mess, and I think this whole thing will drag on for years to come. I'm not sure what the solution is, but it's a complex issue that needs to be carefully considered.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for a government to make it legal or even declare it as lawful. In my opinion, it's more up to the churches to decide, considering the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that any attempt to enforce authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established in the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we've seen, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't prohibit or permit.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend this would be contradictory to what's already in place and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I strongly disagree with that approach.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why the president is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own Catholic beliefs. By doing so, he's essentially showing a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or the government. There's no valid reason to support this amendment, as it seems to be driven by personal views rather than any tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society.\n\nI think I've covered the main points.",
            "Well, I haven't been posting about my thoughts on the Iraq war, but I think it's time to share my views. To be honest, I'm not convinced that the government was entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it's not that clear-cut. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. The fact that so many American soldiers have died in Iraq is heartbreaking, and it's clear that they were removing the Iraqi government without considering the consequences.\n\nThe US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, leading to chaos and power vacuums that are still ongoing. They're trying to implement a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process. The US government should have known better, given their past experiences, that it wouldn't be a clear-cut victory.\n\nIt's hard to abandon a country once you've intervened, especially when you've taken away their government and way of life. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the cost of keeping troops in Iraq for an extended period make it a difficult decision to continue. If the real reason for invading Iraq was to bring democracy, why not do the same for other countries? I believe the real reasons are more about oil and controlling resources, as evidenced by the lack of action against countries like North Korea, which has admitted to having weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon, and there's peace in the region. However, based on the current situation, it's unlikely.",
            "Okay, so I'm trying to gather my thoughts about gay marriage - something I've been strongly in favor of for a while now. It seems to me that whether someone is gay or straight is largely a matter of personal preference, and studies have increasingly shown that it's linked to biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI don't think the government or politics should have a say in this, it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families. I know of a few openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they're just like any other family - they take care of their daily tasks and live their lives like everyone else. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch has shown that there may be a chemical basis for homosexuality, suggesting it's not something you're born into due to your upbringing or environment. It's a complex issue, but it's clear that biology plays a role. I've read numerous articles and reports that support this idea.\n\nEssentially, it comes down to the fact that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately and quietly, but if two gay people try to do the same, it's a public spectacle. I think marriage should be a personal, private matter, not something subject to public scrutiny or federal regulation.",

But over time, it seems we've lost sight of that goal. It's possible we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world we're a superpower. My concern is that the original motivations may have been suspect, given George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the war's purpose was truly to bring democracy, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective within the first few months. The fact that the war has been ongoing for years, draining our resources and lives, makes it far too prolonged.\n\nI genuinely believe our original purpose was noble, and that's why I initially supported the war. Unfortunately, I think our reasons have become distorted and misguided. It seems we're now fighting for the sake of war itself, rather than for a meaningful outcome. We don't want to end the war without a clear victory, but I think that time has passed.\n\nThe war has dragged on for far too long, and it's time to bring it to a close. The Iraqi government will have to fend for itself eventually, and I believe that time has come. We're diverting billions of dollars from our economy, which could be better spent on domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. These problems are far more pressing and deserving of our attention.\n\nIt's alarming to see our money being spent on a war that's lost its original purpose. We have our own internal struggles to address, and it's not wise to prioritize a foreign conflict over our own domestic challenges. The lives of our own citizens are being lost in this conflict, and it's time to reassess our priorities.\n\nThat's my take on the situation.",
            "I wanted to ask a question to clear something up. I understand that someone on the internet found that there was a reason for something not happening, but I'm not sure what that reason was. \n\nOn sites like Myspace, you know, you can share a lot of information about yourself, and that information is available to anyone who can view your profile. Even if you need someone else to be a member to see your profile, you've essentially given them permission to see it by accepting them as a friend. So, it's kind of like you have to expect that a lot of people will see whatever you put on the internet.\n\nI think it's actually a good thing that someone saw something that might have prevented a life from being lost, though. I can understand why it might be tough for someone to monitor all of the profiles on a school's Myspace, but it's not really fair to single out certain students based on their online activity. It's a tricky situation because you can't just have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles, but at the same time, it's not right to discriminate against certain people.\n\nI don't really know how to balance it all out. I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see things about me that I might not want them to see. I've seen this guy on TV who was trying to show how easy it is for people to get information about others online, and it's kind of scary. He got a girl's screen name in just a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. I wouldn't meet with someone I didn't know in person, but I do have people in my classes who know my screen name and can contact me. It's hard to know who's really looking at your information and what they're doing with it.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but at the same time, I don't want to limit it too much because I use it to communicate with friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. I only accept people I know as friends, but I'm not really sure who else can see my information. My roommate was telling me about a time when her high school banned students from having Myspace, and I wasn't really sure how the school officials had the right to make that decision.",
            "I'm hesitant to bring up the Iraq War again, but I feel like it's worth discussing one more time. To be honest, I'm not sure I should be joining the chorus of people who claim they were against the war from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The majority of people everywhere, including the administration, have realized that the war was a bad idea. If we look at recent polls, it's clear that the overwhelming consensus is that the war was a mistake. In fact, polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a bad idea. Even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, around 70%, believe that the war was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. It's little wonder, considering the war has been a disaster from the start. The issue is that there's a huge cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern nations, making it difficult for the US to understand the local culture. The idea that we can impose democracy on a region where it may not be the preferred system is simplistic and misguided. While Saddam was undoubtedly a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. The situation in Iraq has become like quicksand, and I'm not sure what to say about it. Honestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq. I'm skeptical of the administration's claims that staying is beneficial and that problems will arise if we withdraw. I'm yet to hear a legitimate argument for why we should remain in Iraq beyond what's necessary to ensure a safe withdrawal. If the administration wants to pull out gradually, I'm not opposed to that. However, I don't see a compelling reason for us to stay any longer than necessary. What's striking is that, according to statistics, around 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective, and it's possible that they know better than us. By asking them if we should leave and they say yes, we can avoid being blamed if things go wrong. If we do decide to help after that, at least we'll be seen as the good guys – well, as good as we can be in the Middle East.",
            "To be honest, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. I mean, it's not just about women, though. I believe it's more about the specific field someone works in. For instance, even in industries where equality is supposed to be the norm, it can be tough for people to overcome the ingrained biases that have been built up over time. Think about it: most people still struggle to see past the \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from working under a woman. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long, perpetuating the idea that men are the ones in charge.\n\nAs a result, women often feel like they have to work twice as hard to prove themselves. They might have all the qualifications for a promotion, but if they're not part of the traditional upper echelons of a company, they might not get the nod. It's the same issue in other industries, like fashion or caregiving. It's rare to see men taking on the role of primary caregiver, and when they do, society often frowns upon it. People assume that men should be the breadwinners, not the ones staying home with the kids.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's even more complicated. If a man is interested in fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume he's not a \"real\" fashion expert. I mean, typically men who are into fashion have a certain style, and if someone who doesn't fit that mold tries to join the industry, people might wonder if they really know what they're talking about.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though. People from different backgrounds can face discrimination too. For example, if someone grew up on a farm and didn't have the best education, but they're intelligent and work their way up to a high-level position, others might doubt their abilities because of their background. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you speak. So, I think that depending on the field and the individual, there's definitely still a lot of gender (and other forms of) discrimination in the US.\n\nChanging this is tough, though. Society has a set mindset, and it's hard to shift away from that. We've made progress, obviously - women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world - but it's a slow process. As people see more women in leadership positions and stay-at-home dads becoming more common, they're starting to accept it more. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, but change takes time, and we've come a long way already.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it completely legal, but rather decriminalized it. Decriminalization essentially downgrades it from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket - something you get cited for, rather than arrested and booked. This is a big deal for people, especially when it comes to job interviews and other future endeavors, because it's the worst part of having a drug charge. \n\nHowever, there's an argument that it's expensive to arrest and prosecute people, and then let them go. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and have them appear in court multiple times. Plus, there's the cost of public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office. For cash-strapped municipalities, it's hard to justify this expense, even if it would free up money for other important programs. \n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, seems to be okay with decriminalization. They might actually have more money to spend on things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless now. It's a big deal because marijuana isn't something you want to see everywhere, for a variety of reasons. There's a financial element to consider, as well as societal factors. \n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could become like cigarettes - sold in gas stations and consumed everywhere. Some people might be worried about it being a major issue, especially with driving and smoking. It's still taboo in many places, and having it out in the open like that could be awkward for a lot of people. \n\nAlcohol has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. It's hard to generalize about substances, because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, while others can't. It's complicated, and I think both substances have their own set of problems.",
            "I'd have to agree \nThe thing is, a lot of the methods they use have been around for ages \nThey stick to traditional practices, which is good in some ways \nBut it's also essential to be open to change \nMany people within the Catholic Church believe in attending church services every week \nHowever, the Church can be pretty strict about how things are done \nSometimes, it seems like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow their doctrine to the letter \nThey also don't always accept those who don't share their exact beliefs \nFor instance, my parents were both raised in different Christian denominations, and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's background \n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church teaches the importance of loving others, but then doesn't always put that into practice \nThis can come across as hypocritical when you consider their stance on other religions \nI think it's a matter of outdated doctrine that contradicts the actual practice \nThey continue to stick with the old ways, even if they're no longer relevant \n\nI don't think being allowed to marry would necessarily change the behavior of priests who engage in pedophilia \nAs I see it, the issue lies in the power dynamic between the priest and the child, not in their marital status \nIt's not like someone who would abuse a child would suddenly change their ways just because they're married \n\nThose who abuse children tend to do so regardless of their marital status \nIt's the relationship between the abuser and the victim that's the problem, not their marital situation \nSo, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these issues from occurring",
            "I'm still weighing my thoughts on this complex issue, and to be honest, I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong yet. The debate surrounding the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a real brain-twister. It's a delicate matter, and I can see why people might get tripped up trying to navigate it without offending anyone.\n\nFor me, the question of whether marriage should be defined by the government is a tough one. Marriage is often considered a sacred institution, and yet, people who get married don't necessarily receive special treatment from the government just because of their faith. If two people get baptized, for instance, they don't automatically receive tax breaks or other government benefits. It's a similar situation with marriage - it's essentially a civil union, a union between two consenting adults.\n\nI think the government should just focus on recognizing civil unions, rather than trying to define what kind of marriage they are. After all, it's about two individuals coming together in a commitment to each other, not about the specific details of their relationship. The fact that same-sex couples are seeking the same rights as everyone else is a no-brainer - they're just looking for a civil union, just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement on this, it should be made a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a cause that's not significant enough to warrant changing the constitution. The constitution should only be amended for truly fundamental reasons, not for something that affects a relatively small group of people.\n\nTo put it simply, banning gay marriage isn't worth amending the constitution. I'm afraid I'm not on board with that idea.",
            "to be honest, i was raised in a conservative christian household, and as such, homosexuality has always been somewhat of a complicated issue for me.  i have a lot of gay friends, which has definitely broadened my perspective, but at the same time, i still don't fully agree with that lifestyle choice.  however, i do think it should be legalized, but not because it's a federal issue.  i believe it should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves.  after all, different states have different political leanings - some are more liberal, while others are more conservative.  if you're living in a state that leans democratic, it's likely that they'll push for gay marriage, and if you're not comfortable with that, perhaps you should consider moving to a state with different values.  still, i think that people of all orientations should have the same rights and opportunities, so i think it should be legalized state-by-state. \n\nas for the federal government, i don't think it's right for the president to impose their views on the entire country.  take bush, for example - just because he's in office, it doesn't mean he gets to dictate how every state should handle gay marriage.  that's a decision for the states to make, not the president.  and let's be real, he'll be out of office in a few years, so it's not like he'll have to live with the consequences of his decisions.  in the end, i think each state should be free to make their own decisions, without the president's interference.",
            "Honestly, I'd love to dive into this topic, but to be honest, I'm not quite sure where to start. Myspace, as a public platform, is essentially a bulletin board for people to share their thoughts and experiences with others. If you consider that definition, it's pretty clear that anything posted online is visible to the public, including school officials. Whether or not they're accessing it under the school's name, they could still find it through their personal computers at home.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials use online platforms like Myspace to prevent potential threats, such as school shootings, then I think it's perfectly reasonable. After all, it's their responsibility to ensure student safety, and if that means monitoring online activity, then so be it. I mean, think about it - if they're checking the internet to see if students are engaging in activities they shouldn't be, they're doing it specifically to prevent trouble and catch potential issues.\n\nNow, I'm not saying I agree with the idea of invading students' privacy, but if it saves lives and makes the school a safer place, then I'm okay with it. It's not like they're snooping through personal emails or messages; they're just looking at public content. And let's be real, once something's online, it's there forever, so it's not like you can take it back.\n\nI think it's pretty ridiculous for students to expect to post whatever they want online without facing any consequences. I mean, we're all worried about saying something we might regret in an email or message, aren't we? And even if we think we're anonymous, there's always a chance that someone will see it and use it against us.\n\nIt's a bit like this: if you do something in college that gets you into trouble later on, there's no way to get out of it. Once it's online, it's there forever. And I'm not saying I think it's an invasion of privacy just because school officials are monitoring online activity. I mean, like I said before, it's a public thing.\n\nI'm not saying that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to prevent a school shooting, then that's a different story. It's like what my teacher from public high school told me - they have to ensure the school is safe, and that means monitoring online activity.\n\nIt's kind of like during the terrorist attacks; we had to be safe, so we did lockdown drills and stuff. And while that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's kind of similar. They're just trying to prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's basically all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I've been struggling to express my thoughts on the war, and it's been a long time coming. At first, I was all for it after 9/11, as I was personally affected, and I thought we should go in there and create chaos just like they did here. However, I think we overlooked the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nI believe we went in there unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately backfired. I was initially in favor of the war, but now I'm strongly against it. I don't think it's achieved anything. The people over there are so consumed by their own internal conflicts that they can't even fight us effectively. It's a waste of our time and resources to be there.\n\nTo be honest, I've become somewhat desensitized to what's happening over there due to 9/11. I just don't care about the situation anymore. At times, I find it hard to see the Iraqis as human beings because they're so focused on fighting each other. I think we went in there with a simplistic idea of how to solve their problems, but it's not that easy.\n\nWar is a completely different beast in Iraq than it is for us. They have a much more brutal approach to conflict, and I don't think they're interested in improving their country; they just want us out. I think we should just leave and be done with it.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were more driven by revenge and a desire to \"do something\" after 9/11, rather than thinking through the potential consequences. President Bush seemed to take it upon himself to declare war on Iraq, and I understand where he was coming from, but I don't think we had a choice. However, I do think we could have planned better and had a clearer idea of what we were trying to achieve.\n\nLack of unity and a clear plan have hindered our efforts. We didn't have a clear understanding of what we wanted to accomplish, and we didn't prepare for the aftermath. I think that's what ultimately led to the mess we're in.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the Iraqi people. They've always been that way, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify the cost. I believe we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq, and once we leave, the situation will likely collapse."
