            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think there are a few areas where the Catholic Church needs to modernize its views. I believe that the Church's stance on several issues is one of the reasons it's losing followers. They've been saying that they're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things. \n\nFor example, their views on gay marriages, abortions, and birth control are quite strict. While I understand that these are important issues, I think their views are a bit outdated in some ways. If they adapted to a more contemporary way of thinking, I think they'd be less concerned about losing their followers.\n\nHowever, it seems like a lot of people are starting to distance themselves from the Church due to their stance on these issues. They see the Church's views as being out of touch with modern society, which is causing disagreements and divisions. \n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, might make it difficult for people who support it to feel comfortable being part of the Church. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage might not want to be part of a community that views it as wrong. The same goes for other issues like the exclusion of female priests and married priests.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church claims that priests are devoted to God, but everyone else in the world has to balance their job with other aspects of their life, so why should priests be any different? It's not like having a family or other relationships would distract them from their faith.",
            "Honestly, I haven't really had much to say on the topic of gay marriage, but I do have a pretty clear opinion on it. In my view, being gay isn't something that someone chooses, it's just who they are. I don't think people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation, and it's not something that's within their control.\n\nTo me, it seems unfair that people can marry someone of the opposite sex, but not someone of the same sex. It just doesn't seem right to me. I've given it some thought, but to be honest, I haven't put a lot of effort into it because it just seems like a basic issue of equality.\n\nLike, we're all born with our own unique qualities and characteristics - some people are straight, while others are gay. It's not something that people can just decide or choose to be. I think it's unfair to hold gay people to a different standard just because of who they are.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any business getting involved in this issue. It's not a matter of national security, and it's not a moral issue in my opinion. It's just a matter of people being who they are and living their lives. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who people can and can't marry based on their own personal preferences.\n\nIt's hard to put into words, but it just seems like the government is overstepping its bounds when it comes to this issue. They're not addressing any real concerns or threats to society, they're just interfering with people's personal lives. And that's not right.\n\nI think that's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there isn't a valid argument against it. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The fact is that gay couples are vastly different from straight couples, and it's impossible to compare the two. They're like two sides of the same coin - they're fundamentally the same, but with some key differences. It's not like one is inherently better than the other.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is that gay couples are denied certain civil rights, such as the right to make medical decisions for each other or visit each other in the hospital. This is ridiculous, especially since many gay couples are committed to each other for life. Research has shown that homosexual couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples, and they have the same factors that contribute to a healthy relationship.\n\nThe real issue here is that gay couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church wedding. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, including the roles they play in their relationships, and they're just as capable of raising children as straight couples.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Children of gay couples are just as likely to adjust to society as children of straight couples, and they're not more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. The real issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, for example, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nIt's not about the parenting skills of gay couples, but about the societal attitudes towards them. It's not about whether or not children of gay couples will turn out okay, but about whether or not society will accept and support them. The federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal nationwide, and the proposed amendment should be rejected. President Bush's views on the matter are rooted in his own moral beliefs, but morality varies from person to person, and it's not up to the government to impose its own morality on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has stated that these claims are unfounded, and people should listen to research and studies rather than popular opinion or cultural norms. By doing so, we can start to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. People often assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it automatically has no benefits. But, in my opinion, that's not necessarily true. I'd say that for public availability, I'm against it, no question. However, for medical purposes, I believe it's a different story. A drug's illegality doesn't necessarily mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial in some cases, but I think you get my point.\n\nYeah, I mean think about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're prescribed because of their benefits, even though they're restricted. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of the stigma surrounding it, well, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should acknowledge its potential benefits instead.\n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol, since marijuana abuse can have different consequences. Although, like with alcohol, abusing it can lead to problems. It's a complex issue. I'd say we could integrate it into our society gradually, but not all at once, as that could lead to abuse. However, if we could just remove the stigma around marijuana, people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople have this horrible image of marijuana because it's a prohibited substance, but it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could change this perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has already made some changes to adapt to the 21st century. The atmosphere isn't as strict as it was when I was younger. I used to attend church every Sunday and would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just part of the routine, especially since I went to a private school where I'd see my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced a more casual teenage mass that lasts only 30 minutes. People now wear a lot more relaxed clothing, especially during the summer months when some even show up directly from the beach. Even during morning masses, which I used to dress up for, people often wear jeans and khakis, a far cry from the more formal attire of the past. To me, that's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\nAs for other issues, like the allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still develop pedophilic tendencies, and it's not solely because they're allowed or not allowed to get married. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and their attraction to young children isn't something that can be prevented by changing the church's stance on marriage. In fact, some religions already allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh Heaven's reverend or minister, so it's not a matter of whether they're allowed to get married, but rather a personal choice. \n\nI believe that pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that's developed due to upbringing or environment. While there might be some factors that contribute to it, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent these incidents from happening. If they knew about the abuse and were covering it up, then that's a different story, but in many cases, they might not have been aware. \n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any further thoughts to add.",
            "What got me going is that I think the initial premise was somewhat plausible, but the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was still too raw, and I believe it was used as a pretext for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration initially linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which we now know was a false narrative. This really put my hackles up, and the whole Iraq war still boils my blood.\n\nIt's hard to shake the feeling that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American public and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a severe breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the constitution has been evident since 9/11, and it's been a long-term strategy to marginalize it. I believe they had a plan to go to war from the start, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly stemming from his father's administration.\n\nThe alleged plan to expand our energy supply in the region, as revealed by a former Treasury Secretary in his book, adds fuel to the fire. It's an underhanded way to achieve this goal.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, I'm not convinced it's the right time to withdraw, as it could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current alternative, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the solution either, as it could create more problems in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty is at risk, and the interim government is struggling to maintain control.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is ineffective, and even the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. The return of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, is a significant concern. The political process is plagued by infighting and radical factions vying for control, making it a challenging and fractious environment.\n\nI'm at a loss for words to articulate my frustrations in polite company.",
            "I've been trying to think about the War in Iraq, but to be honest, it's a bit of a tough topic for me. I mean, it's not even like it was officially declared as a war, you know? It feels like we just sort of went after Iraq as a way of getting back at them for the 9/11 attacks. So, I haven't really been following it closely, I don't know the details, and I'm not sure what our main goals are anymore. I think we're trying to build democracy over there, but it feels like that's just a way of making Iraq like us, and we're also sort of using it as an excuse to get control of their oil resources. However, I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep sending our troops over there, because it's causing so much tension and hurting innocent people. It's like, if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, but that's going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up. I'm really not sure what to think.\n\nHonestly, I think the whole thing is kind of pointless now. I'm not even sure why we're still calling it a war when it was never officially declared by Congress. I think that's like, a requirement or something. And I'm not sure what our point is anymore. We're using guns to show that we're powerful and American, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep going. I think we should just call it what it is and try to find a way to get out of there without causing more harm.\n\nBut at the same time, I feel bad for the families of our soldiers who are over there, and I don't want them to get hurt. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end when I know that it's affecting so many people's lives. However, I do think that trying to impose our values and culture on Iraq is just going to make things worse for them in the long run. It's a whole different culture over there, and we're just going to end up causing more problems by trying to change them. And I think that's what's going to make the Al-Kaida thing even worse, and they'll just keep hating us more. So, I think this whole thing is just going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Honestly, I have some reservations about the notion that it's right for the government to declare something as legal or illegal, especially when it comes to issues that are largely under the purview of churches. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone principle in the US constitution, and I believe that trying to impose a particular stance on this issue would be a clear disregard for that fundamental principle.\n\nIn my view, attempting to legislate or enforce powers over these matters would be akin to defying the constitution and its guarantees of separation. Moreover, I think that trying to outlaw something based on the prevailing views of one church or denomination over another would be problematic, given that different churches have varying stances on the issue.\n\nThe fact that some churchgoers, like Catholics, are opposed to the practice while others support it, further underscores the idea that it's not for the government to decide what's allowed or prohibited. The separation of church and state is essential for fostering religious tolerance in the US, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be contradictory to its original intent.\n\nIn fact, I think that such an amendment would be one of the few instances where the government would be restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting its own power. I strongly believe that the government should not be involved in this issue, especially when the push for an amendment seems to be driven by personal views rather than a genuine concern for the welfare of the country.\n\nTo me, it's hard to see how an amendment banning the practice would have a tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that it could have a positive effect by allowing individuals to make their own choices and decisions. Ultimately, I think it's up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government or any particular individual with a personal agenda.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on the war in Iraq, but I've been putting it off because I think the government didn't entirely be truthful with the American people about the reasons for the invasion. In my opinion, they tried to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but the two are not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the effects of 9/11, and that's when the invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nAs someone who's generally against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes, I think the war in Iraq is eerily similar to the Vietnam War in many ways. The US government should have learned from past mistakes, but instead, they seem to be repeating them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is absolutely tragic, and it's not just about the human cost – it's also about the fact that the US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing a country's government. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were predicted, but it seems the government didn't take these consequences into consideration.\n\nThe goal was to install a democratic government in Iraq, something that was also attempted in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that imposing a democracy on a foreign country is never an easy task, especially when faced with a large number of insurgents who are determined to resist. Fighting a war against a country's citizens is a much harder and more complex task than fighting a traditional army. \n\nIn my opinion, the US government was not well-prepared for this situation, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that the war would be a quick and easy victory. We've been in Iraq for over a decade now, and many American troops are still dying, and we're still training the Iraqi troops to police their own country – a process that will likely take years. It's clear that the US government underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful.\n\nLooking back at our own history, democracy was a long and difficult struggle to achieve in the US, with periods of civil war and tension. It's naive to think that the same process would be easy for another country. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and difficult process.\n\nAs for what to do now, it's a tough decision because we've been in Iraq for so long. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken responsibility for, but the cost in American lives and resources is becoming increasingly high. One of the main reasons we invaded Iraq was the promise of a democratic Iraq, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I believe the real reason is the oil issue – it's all about control and resources.\n\nIt's also worth noting that before the invasion, the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which are known to possess such weapons, are not being targeted. It's clear that the US government is not being thorough or truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nI can only hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that there will be peace in the country. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely.",
            "I'm a bit stammering here, but let's get to it – I'm for gay marriage. I've always been, to be honest. I genuinely believe it's a personal preference, and research has shown that it's more biological than sociological. It's not something people have control over, so it's inhumane to deny them rights due to it. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I think it's a matter of personal freedom and equality. \n\nI don't think government or politics should interfere with this issue, as it's a personal, household matter. In my neighborhood, I've seen gay couples living openly, and they function just like any other family – they walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and deserve the same respect as everyone else. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to redefine marriage in his own image, disregarding the complexity of the issue.\n\nResearch suggests that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing. For example, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father might not be predisposed to be gay just because of their environment. It's a matter of biology over sociology.\n\nThe main issue is that marriage is something people should be able to choose privately, without it being a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married in secret, they can do so without anyone knowing, but gay couples are often forced to deal with media attention. This highlights the stark difference between a private, personal issue and a public, national matter.\n\nTo me, it's clear that gay marriage should be a personal, private affair, not something subject to government or national scrutiny.",

            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. When it first started, the goal was understandable – to establish democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original purpose over time. Now, it feels like we're in it just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a powerful nation. I've always questioned the motives behind the war, given the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the intention was indeed to spread democracy, that would be a valid reason, but only if personal agendas weren't involved. Unfortunately, I believe that's not the case. I think we made our statement in the first few months of the war, but now it's been dragged out for far too long – over a year, in fact. We've had more than enough time to achieve our initial goal.\n\nIf we were genuinely trying to bring democracy to a nation ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. It's like we're more invested in the idea of being at war than in achieving a decisive victory or a clear outcome.\n\nI truly believe the war has gone on long enough. At some point, the Iraqi government will have to fend for itself, and I think that time has come. We're draining our economy by spending billions on this war when we have pressing issues on our own turf – poverty, internal conflicts, and infrastructure problems – that desperately need attention and funding. We should be prioritizing these issues instead of throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nIt's astonishing that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not even in our long-term budget. We have real problems that need funding – education, healthcare, public roads, and poverty alleviation. The money would be better spent on addressing these critical issues rather than sacrificing our own citizens in a foreign war that's already lost its cause. I think it's time to acknowledge that.",
            "I'm not sure if I can clarify this, but I was wondering about something. It turns out that someone was able to find out about it because they looked it up online.\n\nOkay, so it's not really an invasion of privacy, right? I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's like sharing it with the world. Like on Myspace, you kind of invite people to be your \"friend\" so they can see your profile. By doing that, you're basically giving them permission to see what you've shared.\n\nAnytime you put something online, you've got to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. So if someone was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from happening because they looked up your online info, that's actually a good thing, right?\n\nHowever, it's a bit of a tricky situation. On one hand, you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent problems. That would be unfair and discriminatory. On the other hand, if someone was specifically looking for info, they might be trying to do something malicious.\n\nI don't know, I guess it all depends on the situation. If someone was just browsing profiles and happened to find something suspicious, that's one thing. But if they were actively looking for evidence of something, that's different.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see all the stuff I've shared. I saw this TV show about a guy who was trying to prove how easily he could get people's info online. He managed to get a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger within minutes. It's scary to think about.\n\nIt's tough because you think people know your interests and other stuff about you, so it's hard to know who's really who online. Even if you limit what you post, there's still a lot of info out there. The thing is, I use Facebook to stay in touch with friends, but it's a trade-off between sharing too much or too little.\n\nI don't know, it's a complicated issue. My roommate was telling me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nI guess that's the only other thought I can think of.",
            "hmm, it's been a bit of a struggle to bring myself to talk about the Iraq War again, but it seems like it's one of those topics that can't be avoided. I'm aware that I might sound hypocritical, but I've been thinking a lot about this issue, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were opposed to the war from the start. I mean, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people, both in the US and globally, thought the war was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who refused to acknowledge their own mistakes.\n\nI've been following the polls, and it's evident that over 75-80% of the world's population, including Iraqis, US troops, and people from other parts of the globe, think that the war was a disaster. Even the soldiers on the ground consider it a bad idea and think we should withdraw within a year. It's been a complete mess since before we even intervened, and now the idea of pulling out seems just as catastrophic. The Middle East has always been a complex region, and the culture clash between the US and these countries is a significant contributor to our struggles there. It's not that I think Saddam was a good guy - he wasn't - but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a quagmire like it has.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq right now, and I haven't heard a compelling argument from the administration that convinces me otherwise. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I'm not opposed to that, but I just don't see any reason to stay any longer than we should. The fact that 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter of them think we should leave now, makes me wonder if we're listening to the people we're trying to help. I think they might know better than we do, and if we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. It's better to be the ones who made the decision to leave rather than being stuck in a situation where we're not making progress.",
            "You know, I think gender discrimination is still a pretty big issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; it's more related to the specific field of work you're in. For instance, even though there's supposed to be equality, women often face it tougher because of the \"glass ceiling\" - it's hard for men to find a job under a woman in charge, mainly because of how society's been raised over time. In the workplace, women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in leadership positions. \n\nIt's the same with men in certain industries, like being a stay-at-home dad, which is still not common. When a man decides to take on this role, people often look down on him because society expects men to be the breadwinners. It's tough on them because they might want to be involved in raising their kids and helping their partner with their career. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's another form of discrimination - people often don't take straight men seriously if they're interested in fashion. It's because traditionally, men who like fashion tend to have different lifestyles, and people might question whether they truly understand fashion or not. It's a bit like they're saying, \"How can I trust what you know about fashion if you can't even speak like a 'real' woman?\" It's weird, I know, but it's a thing.\n\nThe thing is, depending on the field of work, there's definitely gender discrimination in society. Changing this is difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is slow. It's happening, though, as women rise to leadership positions and become more accepted in the business world. The same goes for stay-at-home dads - people are starting to realize that maybe the female partner has the better job or wants to be the one working. \n\nTo promote change, you have to show people the good qualities of the people who are usually discriminated against without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good balance now where it's starting to become more accepted. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against, not just based on gender, but also based on where they're from or their education level. For instance, someone who grew up on a farm might have poor grammar but be extremely intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their grammar, even though they're incredibly smart. It's another example of how people can be discriminated against based on their background or education level.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out whether they legalized it or just decriminalized it. From what I understand, they took it down from a crime to something more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and booked. While this might seem like a good thing, I think people still worry about the long-term effects, even after decriminalization. I mean, a marijuana charge can still affect job prospects and other things, which can be pretty bad.\n\nHowever, there's another side to this. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and then let them go. Plus, there's the cost of court appearances, public defenders, and other expenses. When a city is financially struggling, they might not be willing to give up that money, even if it would free up some funds for other things.\n\nDenver's a bit of an exception, though. People there tend to be more open-minded and willing to try new things. And I think that's worked out okay for them, as they've been able to use the saved money for education, social programs, and other good causes.\n\nOf course, there are still valid reasons not to have marijuana everywhere. I'm not sure how I'd feel if it was totally legalized, to be honest. I mean, it could be sold in gas stations like cigarettes, and people might start smoking and driving, which wouldn't be great. Plus, it's still not really accepted in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward.\n\nI also think that marijuana can have some pretty significant effects on people's lifestyles, even if it doesn't necessarily affect their decision-making skills as much as alcohol does. But, like with anything, people react differently, and some folks are just more... let's say, resilient than others. So, it's hard to make general statements about the substance.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "So, I'd say yes to the idea of adapting certain traditional practices, considering they've been followed for a long time. It's good to have some roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be open to change. The thing is, a lot of Catholics believe in sticking to their weekly church attendance and being very strict about their practices. However, it often feels like they look down on those who don't follow their doctrine to the letter, and they don't accept people with different beliefs or those from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my parents are a good example - my mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. They wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they weren't allowed to because of my dad's religion. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is a fundamental principle. It's hypocritical when you say you're supposed to love others but then exclude them because of their differences. I think the Catholic Church often gets stuck on outdated ideas and sticks to them even though they contradict their own teachings.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not sure it would make a difference in the way some priests behave. It's a separate issue altogether. Even if priests were allowed to marry, some might still engage in certain behaviors because it's about the nature of their actions, not their marital status. So, in this case, I'm not convinced that allowing priests to get married would necessarily prevent those issues from happening.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this complex issue. I'm not quite sure which side has the stronger argument, but I do think this is one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. The line between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a tough one to tread without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm still undecided on how to approach it - all I know is that civil unions sound like a good starting point. I'm not convinced that marriage should be seen as a purely government-defined institution, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament by many people. If that's the case, then why would the government care about what kind of marriage it is? It's just about two people committing to each other, and that's what a civil union is. It shouldn't matter what the government thinks about the type of marriage it is - it's just about two people uniting.\n\nAs for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people entering into a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then they should push for it to become federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure to me. It's a big issue for some people, but not big enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's not a vital enough issue to redefine the constitution and ban gay marriage. To put it simply, I'm just not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to think.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a complicated view on homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. On one hand, I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it hard for me to take a firm stance against it. However, I still have some reservations about the lifestyle. Despite this, I think it should be legalized and not be a national issue that the president decides for the entire country. I believe that each state should have the freedom to make its own decision on the matter.\n\nI understand that some states are democratic and others are republican, and it's likely that democratic states will support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or bans gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with the decision. It's ultimately up to the individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves.\n\nWhat I do think is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. Given this, I believe that the decision on gay marriage should be left to each state to decide for themselves. I also think it's unfair for the president to impose his opinion on the whole country. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so why should he decide how each one runs itself? Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide for themselves, as they'll be the ones living with the consequences of that decision.",
            "Here's the issue - I don't want to post right now because I'm trying to figure out how to get my thoughts across, but essentially, I want to talk about Myspace and why I think school officials could have accessed my information on it. I suppose it's a public platform, like a bulletin board where you can post for everyone to see, and that's okay, but what if school officials see it? They could have checked it from home, even if it wasn't associated with the school's name. \n\nMy opinion is that if it means saving lives and keeping students safe, it's okay for them to check, even if it feels like an invasion of privacy. It's their responsibility to prevent school shootings, like what happened at Columbine. If they check Myspace to see if students are doing stuff they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay too, as long as it's not just to get them in trouble.\n\nIt's easy to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess that's not the point. It's a public thing, and if you post something on Myspace and don't expect to get in trouble, that's a bit naive. I'm worried about posting stuff online because I know it can come back to haunt me. If I post something negative about someone, it could be found later and cause problems. \n\nIf you do something as a college student that's not good, it can follow you later and get you in trouble. Once something's on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. School officials might not be looking for trouble, but if they find something that helps make the school a safer place, that's okay. They're just doing their job, like teachers who have to prepare for lockdowns and other safety measures.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that it's a public platform, but school officials have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, that's okay. They're not just trying to catch students, they're trying to prevent bad things from happening. I think that's a reasonable thing to do.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about the war and my initial reaction to it. I have to admit that I was fully on board with it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to see justice served and to create chaos in response to what happened over here. However, I think we got caught up in the emotions of the situation and overlooked the bigger picture. We charged in without a clear plan, and I genuinely believe that backfired on us.\n\nNow, I've done a complete turnaround and I'm strongly against the war. In my opinion, it didn't achieve anything. The people over there are too busy fighting among themselves to pose a threat to us, so our presence is doing more harm than good. The fact that they can't even put aside their differences to work together is quite telling.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 has left me with a sense of apathy towards the conflict in the Middle East. I struggle to care about their struggles because their concept of war is so different from ours. They seem to be more focused on driving us out than on improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them figure out their own problems.\n\nI believe our initial decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge and a knee-jerk reaction to the traumatic event. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand where he was coming from, I think we were ill-prepared for the consequences. We didn't have a clear plan for creating order or establishing a unified front. This lack of vision and unity ultimately led to more chaos and division.\n\nLooking back, I think we should have taken a more measured approach and had a solid plan in place before invading. In the end, I don't believe we're equipped to change the people of Iraq. They've been a complex and fragmented society for centuries, and it's unlikely that we can force them to become something else. Our continued presence is only exacerbating the situation, and I think we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nIt's a complex issue, and I don't have any easy answers. However, I do know that we need to reassess our role in the conflict and focus on finding a way out. The longer we stay, the more we'll be contributing to the instability and chaos in the region. It's time for us to acknowledge that we can't stay forever and start making plans for a peaceful exit."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nI feel like the war has been drawn out far too much \nI think the purpose was good in the beginning \nUm \nMeaning to restore democracy in another country \nBut \nI think we’ve long since lost sight of that purpose \nAnd \nWe’re now just maybe doing it for the sake of doing it \nJust to prove that we’re some sort of super power in the world \nI just think also maybe the motives were originally questionable dealing with \nUm \nGeorge Bush’s father’s previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein \nSo \nI think \nUm \nI think the original motivation if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system then that would be a fair motivation if there were any personal matters in it I do not think it would have been fair \nBut \nI do think it’s been drawn out \nUm \nI think we got our purpose across in the first couple months just starting the war I think that was a statement in and of itself \nBut \nThe fact that it has gone on for over a year several years \nI just think it’s way too drawn out \n\nUm \nYeah I think \nUm \nI mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country that was ruled by a tyrant I think that’s a just purpose \nAnd \nThat’s good reason for the war \nBut \nI don’t think \nI think our reason over time has been deteriorated \nAnd \nMisconceived \nJust like seems that we’re still at war for the purpose of going to war \nAnd \nWe don’t want to come out of this thing without a decisive end a victory or what not \n\nUm \nYeah I do think it has gone on long enough \nAnd \nIt should stop \nI mean there comes a point when their government \nTheir officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway \nAnd \nI think that time has come \nWe’ve long since been draining our own economy spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf such as poverty and what not that we should be spending that money on I think it’s a drain on our economy for a purpose that’s long since been drawn out \n\nYeah I mean they’re spending billions and billions of dollars \nAnd \nWar is not something that should be in our budget for the long term \nThere are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements \nYou know \nUm \nPublic roads or anything dealing with schools \nWe certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that \nHealth care that I think that money could be much better spent on \nRight now that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we’ve lost the cause for \n\nI think that’s it \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

They've been saying that they're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things. \n\nFor example, their views on gay marriages, abortions, and birth control are quite strict. While I understand that these are important issues, I think their views are a bit outdated in some ways. If they adapted to a more contemporary way of thinking, I think they'd be less concerned about losing their followers.\n\nHowever, it seems like a lot of people are starting to distance themselves from the Church due to their stance on these issues. They see the Church's views as being out of touch with modern society, which is causing disagreements and divisions. \n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, might make it difficult for people who support it to feel comfortable being part of the Church. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage might not want to be part of a community that views it as wrong. The same goes for other issues like the exclusion of female priests and married priests.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church claims that priests are devoted to God, but everyone else in the world has to balance their job with other aspects of their life, so why should priests be any different? It's not like having a family or other relationships would distract them from their faith.",
            "Honestly, I haven't really had much to say on the topic of gay marriage, but I do have a pretty clear opinion on it. In my view, being gay isn't something that someone chooses, it's just who they are. I don't think people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation, and it's not something that's within their control.\n\nTo me, it seems unfair that people can marry someone of the opposite sex, but not someone of the same sex. It just doesn't seem right to me. I've given it some thought, but to be honest, I haven't put a lot of effort into it because it just seems like a basic issue of equality.\n\nLike, we're all born with our own unique qualities and characteristics - some people are straight, while others are gay. It's not something that people can just decide or choose to be. I think it's unfair to hold gay people to a different standard just because of who they are.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any business getting involved in this issue. It's not a matter of national security, and it's not a moral issue in my opinion. It's just a matter of people being who they are and living their lives. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who people can and can't marry based on their own personal preferences.\n\nIt's hard to put into words, but it just seems like the government is overstepping its bounds when it comes to this issue. They're not addressing any real concerns or threats to society, they're just interfering with people's personal lives. And that's not right.\n\nI think that's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there isn't a valid argument against it. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The fact is that gay couples are vastly different from straight couples, and it's impossible to compare the two. They're like two sides of the same coin - they're fundamentally the same, but with some key differences. It's not like one is inherently better than the other.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is that gay couples are denied certain civil rights, such as the right to make medical decisions for each other or visit each other in the hospital. This is ridiculous, especially since many gay couples are committed to each other for life. Research has shown that homosexual couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples, and they have the same factors that contribute to a healthy relationship.\n\nThe real issue here is that gay couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church wedding. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, including the roles they play in their relationships, and they're just as capable of raising children as straight couples.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Children of gay couples are just as likely to adjust to society as children of straight couples, and they're not more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. The real issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, for example, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nIt's not about the parenting skills of gay couples, but about the societal attitudes towards them. It's not about whether or not children of gay couples will turn out okay, but about whether or not society will accept and support them. The federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal nationwide, and the proposed amendment should be rejected. President Bush's views on the matter are rooted in his own moral beliefs, but morality varies from person to person, and it's not up to the government to impose its own morality on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has stated that these claims are unfounded, and people should listen to research and studies rather than popular opinion or cultural norms. By doing so, we can start to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. People often assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it automatically has no benefits. But, in my opinion, that's not necessarily true. I'd say that for public availability, I'm against it, no question. However, for medical purposes, I believe it's a different story. A drug's illegality doesn't necessarily mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial in some cases, but I think you get my point.\n\nYeah, I mean think about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're prescribed because of their benefits, even though they're restricted. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of the stigma surrounding it, well, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should acknowledge its potential benefits instead.\n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol, since marijuana abuse can have different consequences. Although, like with alcohol, abusing it can lead to problems. It's a complex issue. I'd say we could integrate it into our society gradually, but not all at once, as that could lead to abuse. However, if we could just remove the stigma around marijuana, people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople have this horrible image of marijuana because it's a prohibited substance, but it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could change this perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has already made some changes to adapt to the 21st century. The atmosphere isn't as strict as it was when I was younger. I used to attend church every Sunday and would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just part of the routine, especially since I went to a private school where I'd see my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced a more casual teenage mass that lasts only 30 minutes. People now wear a lot more relaxed clothing, especially during the summer months when some even show up directly from the beach. Even during morning masses, which I used to dress up for, people often wear jeans and khakis, a far cry from the more formal attire of the past. To me, that's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\nAs for other issues, like the allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still develop pedophilic tendencies, and it's not solely because they're allowed or not allowed to get married. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and their attraction to young children isn't something that can be prevented by changing the church's stance on marriage. In fact, some religions already allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh Heaven's reverend or minister, so it's not a matter of whether they're allowed to get married, but rather a personal choice. \n\nI believe that pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that's developed due to upbringing or environment. While there might be some factors that contribute to it, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent these incidents from happening. If they knew about the abuse and were covering it up, then that's a different story, but in many cases, they might not have been aware. \n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any further thoughts to add.",
            "What got me going is that I think the initial premise was somewhat plausible, but the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was still too raw, and I believe it was used as a pretext for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration initially linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which we now know was a false narrative. This really put my hackles up, and the whole Iraq war still boils my blood.\n\nIt's hard to shake the feeling that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American public and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a severe breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the constitution has been evident since 9/11, and it's been a long-term strategy to marginalize it. I believe they had a plan to go to war from the start, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly stemming from his father's administration.\n\nThe alleged plan to expand our energy supply in the region, as revealed by a former Treasury Secretary in his book, adds fuel to the fire. It's an underhanded way to achieve this goal.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, I'm not convinced it's the right time to withdraw, as it could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current alternative, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the solution either, as it could create more problems in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty is at risk, and the interim government is struggling to maintain control.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is ineffective, and even the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. The return of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, is a significant concern. The political process is plagued by infighting and radical factions vying for control, making it a challenging and fractious environment.\n\nI'm at a loss for words to articulate my frustrations in polite company.",
            "I've been trying to think about the War in Iraq, but to be honest, it's a bit of a tough topic for me. I mean, it's not even like it was officially declared as a war, you know? It feels like we just sort of went after Iraq as a way of getting back at them for the 9/11 attacks. So, I haven't really been following it closely, I don't know the details, and I'm not sure what our main goals are anymore. I think we're trying to build democracy over there, but it feels like that's just a way of making Iraq like us, and we're also sort of using it as an excuse to get control of their oil resources. However, I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep sending our troops over there, because it's causing so much tension and hurting innocent people. It's like, if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, but that's going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up. I'm really not sure what to think.\n\nHonestly, I think the whole thing is kind of pointless now. I'm not even sure why we're still calling it a war when it was never officially declared by Congress. I think that's like, a requirement or something. And I'm not sure what our point is anymore. We're using guns to show that we're powerful and American, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep going. I think we should just call it what it is and try to find a way to get out of there without causing more harm.\n\nBut at the same time, I feel bad for the families of our soldiers who are over there, and I don't want them to get hurt. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end when I know that it's affecting so many people's lives. However, I do think that trying to impose our values and culture on Iraq is just going to make things worse for them in the long run. It's a whole different culture over there, and we're just going to end up causing more problems by trying to change them. And I think that's what's going to make the Al-Kaida thing even worse, and they'll just keep hating us more. So, I think this whole thing is just going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Honestly, I have some reservations about the notion that it's right for the government to declare something as legal or illegal, especially when it comes to issues that are largely under the purview of churches. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone principle in the US constitution, and I believe that trying to impose a particular stance on this issue would be a clear disregard for that fundamental principle.\n\nIn my view, attempting to legislate or enforce powers over these matters would be akin to defying the constitution and its guarantees of separation. Moreover, I think that trying to outlaw something based on the prevailing views of one church or denomination over another would be problematic, given that different churches have varying stances on the issue.\n\nThe fact that some churchgoers, like Catholics, are opposed to the practice while others support it, further underscores the idea that it's not for the government to decide what's allowed or prohibited. The separation of church and state is essential for fostering religious tolerance in the US, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be contradictory to its original intent.\n\nIn fact, I think that such an amendment would be one of the few instances where the government would be restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting its own power. I strongly believe that the government should not be involved in this issue, especially when the push for an amendment seems to be driven by personal views rather than a genuine concern for the welfare of the country.\n\nTo me, it's hard to see how an amendment banning the practice would have a tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that it could have a positive effect by allowing individuals to make their own choices and decisions. Ultimately, I think it's up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government or any particular individual with a personal agenda.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on the war in Iraq, but I've been putting it off because I think the government didn't entirely be truthful with the American people about the reasons for the invasion. In my opinion, they tried to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but the two are not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the effects of 9/11, and that's when the invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nAs someone who's generally against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes, I think the war in Iraq is eerily similar to the Vietnam War in many ways. The US government should have learned from past mistakes, but instead, they seem to be repeating them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is absolutely tragic, and it's not just about the human cost – it's also about the fact that the US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing a country's government. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were predicted, but it seems the government didn't take these consequences into consideration.\n\nThe goal was to install a democratic government in Iraq, something that was also attempted in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that imposing a democracy on a foreign country is never an easy task, especially when faced with a large number of insurgents who are determined to resist. Fighting a war against a country's citizens is a much harder and more complex task than fighting a traditional army. \n\nIn my opinion, the US government was not well-prepared for this situation, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that the war would be a quick and easy victory. We've been in Iraq for over a decade now, and many American troops are still dying, and we're still training the Iraqi troops to police their own country – a process that will likely take years. It's clear that the US government underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful.\n\nLooking back at our own history, democracy was a long and difficult struggle to achieve in the US, with periods of civil war and tension. It's naive to think that the same process would be easy for another country. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and difficult process.\n\nAs for what to do now, it's a tough decision because we've been in Iraq for so long. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken responsibility for, but the cost in American lives and resources is becoming increasingly high. One of the main reasons we invaded Iraq was the promise of a democratic Iraq, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I believe the real reason is the oil issue – it's all about control and resources.\n\nIt's also worth noting that before the invasion, the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which are known to possess such weapons, are not being targeted. It's clear that the US government is not being thorough or truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nI can only hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that there will be peace in the country. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely.",
            "I'm a bit stammering here, but let's get to it – I'm for gay marriage. I've always been, to be honest. I genuinely believe it's a personal preference, and research has shown that it's more biological than sociological. It's not something people have control over, so it's inhumane to deny them rights due to it. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I think it's a matter of personal freedom and equality. \n\nI don't think government or politics should interfere with this issue, as it's a personal, household matter. In my neighborhood, I've seen gay couples living openly, and they function just like any other family – they walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and deserve the same respect as everyone else. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to redefine marriage in his own image, disregarding the complexity of the issue.\n\nResearch suggests that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing. For example, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father might not be predisposed to be gay just because of their environment. It's a matter of biology over sociology.\n\nThe main issue is that marriage is something people should be able to choose privately, without it being a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married in secret, they can do so without anyone knowing, but gay couples are often forced to deal with media attention. This highlights the stark difference between a private, personal issue and a public, national matter.\n\nTo me, it's clear that gay marriage should be a personal, private affair, not something subject to government or national scrutiny.",

            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. When it first started, the goal was understandable – to establish democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original purpose over time. Now, it feels like we're in it just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a powerful nation. I've always questioned the motives behind the war, given the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the intention was indeed to spread democracy, that would be a valid reason, but only if personal agendas weren't involved. Unfortunately, I believe that's not the case. I think we made our statement in the first few months of the war, but now it's been dragged out for far too long – over a year, in fact. We've had more than enough time to achieve our initial goal.\n\nIf we were genuinely trying to bring democracy to a nation ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. It's like we're more invested in the idea of being at war than in achieving a decisive victory or a clear outcome.\n\nI truly believe the war has gone on long enough. At some point, the Iraqi government will have to fend for itself, and I think that time has come. We're draining our economy by spending billions on this war when we have pressing issues on our own turf – poverty, internal conflicts, and infrastructure problems – that desperately need attention and funding. We should be prioritizing these issues instead of throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nIt's astonishing that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not even in our long-term budget. We have real problems that need funding – education, healthcare, public roads, and poverty alleviation. The money would be better spent on addressing these critical issues rather than sacrificing our own citizens in a foreign war that's already lost its cause. I think it's time to acknowledge that.",
            "I'm not sure if I can clarify this, but I was wondering about something. It turns out that someone was able to find out about it because they looked it up online.\n\nOkay, so it's not really an invasion of privacy, right? I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's like sharing it with the world. Like on Myspace, you kind of invite people to be your \"friend\" so they can see your profile. By doing that, you're basically giving them permission to see what you've shared.\n\nAnytime you put something online, you've got to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. So if someone was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from happening because they looked up your online info, that's actually a good thing, right?\n\nHowever, it's a bit of a tricky situation. On one hand, you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent problems. That would be unfair and discriminatory. On the other hand, if someone was specifically looking for info, they might be trying to do something malicious.\n\nI don't know, I guess it all depends on the situation. If someone was just browsing profiles and happened to find something suspicious, that's one thing. But if they were actively looking for evidence of something, that's different.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see all the stuff I've shared. I saw this TV show about a guy who was trying to prove how easily he could get people's info online. He managed to get a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger within minutes. It's scary to think about.\n\nIt's tough because you think people know your interests and other stuff about you, so it's hard to know who's really who online. Even if you limit what you post, there's still a lot of info out there. The thing is, I use Facebook to stay in touch with friends, but it's a trade-off between sharing too much or too little.\n\nI don't know, it's a complicated issue. My roommate was telling me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nI guess that's the only other thought I can think of.",
            "hmm, it's been a bit of a struggle to bring myself to talk about the Iraq War again, but it seems like it's one of those topics that can't be avoided. I'm aware that I might sound hypocritical, but I've been thinking a lot about this issue, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were opposed to the war from the start. I mean, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people, both in the US and globally, thought the war was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who refused to acknowledge their own mistakes.\n\nI've been following the polls, and it's evident that over 75-80% of the world's population, including Iraqis, US troops, and people from other parts of the globe, think that the war was a disaster. Even the soldiers on the ground consider it a bad idea and think we should withdraw within a year. It's been a complete mess since before we even intervened, and now the idea of pulling out seems just as catastrophic. The Middle East has always been a complex region, and the culture clash between the US and these countries is a significant contributor to our struggles there. It's not that I think Saddam was a good guy - he wasn't - but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a quagmire like it has.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq right now, and I haven't heard a compelling argument from the administration that convinces me otherwise. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I'm not opposed to that, but I just don't see any reason to stay any longer than we should. The fact that 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter of them think we should leave now, makes me wonder if we're listening to the people we're trying to help. I think they might know better than we do, and if we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. It's better to be the ones who made the decision to leave rather than being stuck in a situation where we're not making progress.",
            "You know, I think gender discrimination is still a pretty big issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; it's more related to the specific field of work you're in. For instance, even though there's supposed to be equality, women often face it tougher because of the \"glass ceiling\" - it's hard for men to find a job under a woman in charge, mainly because of how society's been raised over time. In the workplace, women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in leadership positions. \n\nIt's the same with men in certain industries, like being a stay-at-home dad, which is still not common. When a man decides to take on this role, people often look down on him because society expects men to be the breadwinners. It's tough on them because they might want to be involved in raising their kids and helping their partner with their career. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's another form of discrimination - people often don't take straight men seriously if they're interested in fashion. It's because traditionally, men who like fashion tend to have different lifestyles, and people might question whether they truly understand fashion or not. It's a bit like they're saying, \"How can I trust what you know about fashion if you can't even speak like a 'real' woman?\" It's weird, I know, but it's a thing.\n\nThe thing is, depending on the field of work, there's definitely gender discrimination in society. Changing this is difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is slow. It's happening, though, as women rise to leadership positions and become more accepted in the business world. The same goes for stay-at-home dads - people are starting to realize that maybe the female partner has the better job or wants to be the one working. \n\nTo promote change, you have to show people the good qualities of the people who are usually discriminated against without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good balance now where it's starting to become more accepted. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against, not just based on gender, but also based on where they're from or their education level. For instance, someone who grew up on a farm might have poor grammar but be extremely intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their grammar, even though they're incredibly smart. It's another example of how people can be discriminated against based on their background or education level.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out whether they legalized it or just decriminalized it. From what I understand, they took it down from a crime to something more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and booked. While this might seem like a good thing, I think people still worry about the long-term effects, even after decriminalization. I mean, a marijuana charge can still affect job prospects and other things, which can be pretty bad.\n\nHowever, there's another side to this. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and then let them go. Plus, there's the cost of court appearances, public defenders, and other expenses. When a city is financially struggling, they might not be willing to give up that money, even if it would free up some funds for other things.\n\nDenver's a bit of an exception, though. People there tend to be more open-minded and willing to try new things. And I think that's worked out okay for them, as they've been able to use the saved money for education, social programs, and other good causes.\n\nOf course, there are still valid reasons not to have marijuana everywhere. I'm not sure how I'd feel if it was totally legalized, to be honest. I mean, it could be sold in gas stations like cigarettes, and people might start smoking and driving, which wouldn't be great. Plus, it's still not really accepted in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward.\n\nI also think that marijuana can have some pretty significant effects on people's lifestyles, even if it doesn't necessarily affect their decision-making skills as much as alcohol does. But, like with anything, people react differently, and some folks are just more... let's say, resilient than others. So, it's hard to make general statements about the substance.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "So, I'd say yes to the idea of adapting certain traditional practices, considering they've been followed for a long time. It's good to have some roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be open to change. The thing is, a lot of Catholics believe in sticking to their weekly church attendance and being very strict about their practices. However, it often feels like they look down on those who don't follow their doctrine to the letter, and they don't accept people with different beliefs or those from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my parents are a good example - my mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. They wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they weren't allowed to because of my dad's religion. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is a fundamental principle. It's hypocritical when you say you're supposed to love others but then exclude them because of their differences. I think the Catholic Church often gets stuck on outdated ideas and sticks to them even though they contradict their own teachings.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not sure it would make a difference in the way some priests behave. It's a separate issue altogether. Even if priests were allowed to marry, some might still engage in certain behaviors because it's about the nature of their actions, not their marital status. So, in this case, I'm not convinced that allowing priests to get married would necessarily prevent those issues from happening.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this complex issue. I'm not quite sure which side has the stronger argument, but I do think this is one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. The line between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a tough one to tread without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm still undecided on how to approach it - all I know is that civil unions sound like a good starting point. I'm not convinced that marriage should be seen as a purely government-defined institution, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament by many people. If that's the case, then why would the government care about what kind of marriage it is? It's just about two people committing to each other, and that's what a civil union is. It shouldn't matter what the government thinks about the type of marriage it is - it's just about two people uniting.\n\nAs for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people entering into a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then they should push for it to become federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure to me. It's a big issue for some people, but not big enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's not a vital enough issue to redefine the constitution and ban gay marriage. To put it simply, I'm just not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to think.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a complicated view on homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. On one hand, I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it hard for me to take a firm stance against it. However, I still have some reservations about the lifestyle. Despite this, I think it should be legalized and not be a national issue that the president decides for the entire country. I believe that each state should have the freedom to make its own decision on the matter.\n\nI understand that some states are democratic and others are republican, and it's likely that democratic states will support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or bans gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with the decision. It's ultimately up to the individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves.\n\nWhat I do think is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. Given this, I believe that the decision on gay marriage should be left to each state to decide for themselves. I also think it's unfair for the president to impose his opinion on the whole country. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so why should he decide how each one runs itself? Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide for themselves, as they'll be the ones living with the consequences of that decision.",
            "Here's the issue - I don't want to post right now because I'm trying to figure out how to get my thoughts across, but essentially, I want to talk about Myspace and why I think school officials could have accessed my information on it. I suppose it's a public platform, like a bulletin board where you can post for everyone to see, and that's okay, but what if school officials see it? They could have checked it from home, even if it wasn't associated with the school's name. \n\nMy opinion is that if it means saving lives and keeping students safe, it's okay for them to check, even if it feels like an invasion of privacy. It's their responsibility to prevent school shootings, like what happened at Columbine. If they check Myspace to see if students are doing stuff they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay too, as long as it's not just to get them in trouble.\n\nIt's easy to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess that's not the point. It's a public thing, and if you post something on Myspace and don't expect to get in trouble, that's a bit naive. I'm worried about posting stuff online because I know it can come back to haunt me. If I post something negative about someone, it could be found later and cause problems. \n\nIf you do something as a college student that's not good, it can follow you later and get you in trouble. Once something's on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. School officials might not be looking for trouble, but if they find something that helps make the school a safer place, that's okay. They're just doing their job, like teachers who have to prepare for lockdowns and other safety measures.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that it's a public platform, but school officials have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, that's okay. They're not just trying to catch students, they're trying to prevent bad things from happening. I think that's a reasonable thing to do.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about the war and my initial reaction to it. I have to admit that I was fully on board with it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to see justice served and to create chaos in response to what happened over here. However, I think we got caught up in the emotions of the situation and overlooked the bigger picture. We charged in without a clear plan, and I genuinely believe that backfired on us.\n\nNow, I've done a complete turnaround and I'm strongly against the war. In my opinion, it didn't achieve anything. The people over there are too busy fighting among themselves to pose a threat to us, so our presence is doing more harm than good. The fact that they can't even put aside their differences to work together is quite telling.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 has left me with a sense of apathy towards the conflict in the Middle East. I struggle to care about their struggles because their concept of war is so different from ours. They seem to be more focused on driving us out than on improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them figure out their own problems.\n\nI believe our initial decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge and a knee-jerk reaction to the traumatic event. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand where he was coming from, I think we were ill-prepared for the consequences. We didn't have a clear plan for creating order or establishing a unified front. This lack of vision and unity ultimately led to more chaos and division.\n\nLooking back, I think we should have taken a more measured approach and had a solid plan in place before invading. In the end, I don't believe we're equipped to change the people of Iraq. They've been a complex and fragmented society for centuries, and it's unlikely that we can force them to become something else. Our continued presence is only exacerbating the situation, and I think we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nIt's a complex issue, and I don't have any easy answers. However, I do know that we need to reassess our role in the conflict and focus on finding a way out. The longer we stay, the more we'll be contributing to the instability and chaos in the region. It's time for us to acknowledge that we can't stay forever and start making plans for a peaceful exit."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think there are a few areas where the Catholic Church needs to modernize its views. I believe that the Church's stance on several issues is one of the reasons it's losing followers. They've been saying that they're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things. \n\nFor example, their views on gay marriages, abortions, and birth control are quite strict. While I understand that these are important issues, I think their views are a bit outdated in some ways. If they adapted to a more contemporary way of thinking, I think they'd be less concerned about losing their followers.\n\nHowever, it seems like a lot of people are starting to distance themselves from the Church due to their stance on these issues. They see the Church's views as being out of touch with modern society, which is causing disagreements and divisions. \n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, might make it difficult for people who support it to feel comfortable being part of the Church. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage might not want to be part of a community that views it as wrong. The same goes for other issues like the exclusion of female priests and married priests.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church claims that priests are devoted to God, but everyone else in the world has to balance their job with other aspects of their life, so why should priests be any different? It's not like having a family or other relationships would distract them from their faith.",
            "Honestly, I haven't really had much to say on the topic of gay marriage, but I do have a pretty clear opinion on it. In my view, being gay isn't something that someone chooses, it's just who they are. I don't think people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation, and it's not something that's within their control.\n\nTo me, it seems unfair that people can marry someone of the opposite sex, but not someone of the same sex. It just doesn't seem right to me. I've given it some thought, but to be honest, I haven't put a lot of effort into it because it just seems like a basic issue of equality.\n\nLike, we're all born with our own unique qualities and characteristics - some people are straight, while others are gay. It's not something that people can just decide or choose to be. I think it's unfair to hold gay people to a different standard just because of who they are.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any business getting involved in this issue. It's not a matter of national security, and it's not a moral issue in my opinion. It's just a matter of people being who they are and living their lives. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who people can and can't marry based on their own personal preferences.\n\nIt's hard to put into words, but it just seems like the government is overstepping its bounds when it comes to this issue. They're not addressing any real concerns or threats to society, they're just interfering with people's personal lives. And that's not right.\n\nI think that's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there isn't a valid argument against it. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The fact is that gay couples are vastly different from straight couples, and it's impossible to compare the two. They're like two sides of the same coin - they're fundamentally the same, but with some key differences. It's not like one is inherently better than the other.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is that gay couples are denied certain civil rights, such as the right to make medical decisions for each other or visit each other in the hospital. This is ridiculous, especially since many gay couples are committed to each other for life. Research has shown that homosexual couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples, and they have the same factors that contribute to a healthy relationship.\n\nThe real issue here is that gay couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church wedding. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, including the roles they play in their relationships, and they're just as capable of raising children as straight couples.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Children of gay couples are just as likely to adjust to society as children of straight couples, and they're not more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. The real issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, for example, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nIt's not about the parenting skills of gay couples, but about the societal attitudes towards them. It's not about whether or not children of gay couples will turn out okay, but about whether or not society will accept and support them. The federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal nationwide, and the proposed amendment should be rejected. President Bush's views on the matter are rooted in his own moral beliefs, but morality varies from person to person, and it's not up to the government to impose its own morality on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has stated that these claims are unfounded, and people should listen to research and studies rather than popular opinion or cultural norms. By doing so, we can start to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. People often assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it automatically has no benefits. But, in my opinion, that's not necessarily true. I'd say that for public availability, I'm against it, no question. However, for medical purposes, I believe it's a different story. A drug's illegality doesn't necessarily mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial in some cases, but I think you get my point.\n\nYeah, I mean think about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're prescribed because of their benefits, even though they're restricted. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of the stigma surrounding it, well, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should acknowledge its potential benefits instead.\n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol, since marijuana abuse can have different consequences. Although, like with alcohol, abusing it can lead to problems. It's a complex issue. I'd say we could integrate it into our society gradually, but not all at once, as that could lead to abuse. However, if we could just remove the stigma around marijuana, people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople have this horrible image of marijuana because it's a prohibited substance, but it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could change this perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has already made some changes to adapt to the 21st century. The atmosphere isn't as strict as it was when I was younger. I used to attend church every Sunday and would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just part of the routine, especially since I went to a private school where I'd see my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced a more casual teenage mass that lasts only 30 minutes. People now wear a lot more relaxed clothing, especially during the summer months when some even show up directly from the beach. Even during morning masses, which I used to dress up for, people often wear jeans and khakis, a far cry from the more formal attire of the past. To me, that's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\nAs for other issues, like the allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still develop pedophilic tendencies, and it's not solely because they're allowed or not allowed to get married. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and their attraction to young children isn't something that can be prevented by changing the church's stance on marriage. In fact, some religions already allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh Heaven's reverend or minister, so it's not a matter of whether they're allowed to get married, but rather a personal choice. \n\nI believe that pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that's developed due to upbringing or environment. While there might be some factors that contribute to it, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent these incidents from happening. If they knew about the abuse and were covering it up, then that's a different story, but in many cases, they might not have been aware. \n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any further thoughts to add.",
            "What got me going is that I think the initial premise was somewhat plausible, but the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was still too raw, and I believe it was used as a pretext for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration initially linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which we now know was a false narrative. This really put my hackles up, and the whole Iraq war still boils my blood.\n\nIt's hard to shake the feeling that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American public and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a severe breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the constitution has been evident since 9/11, and it's been a long-term strategy to marginalize it. I believe they had a plan to go to war from the start, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly stemming from his father's administration.\n\nThe alleged plan to expand our energy supply in the region, as revealed by a former Treasury Secretary in his book, adds fuel to the fire. It's an underhanded way to achieve this goal.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, I'm not convinced it's the right time to withdraw, as it could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current alternative, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the solution either, as it could create more problems in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty is at risk, and the interim government is struggling to maintain control.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is ineffective, and even the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. The return of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, is a significant concern. The political process is plagued by infighting and radical factions vying for control, making it a challenging and fractious environment.\n\nI'm at a loss for words to articulate my frustrations in polite company.",
            "I've been trying to think about the War in Iraq, but to be honest, it's a bit of a tough topic for me. I mean, it's not even like it was officially declared as a war, you know? It feels like we just sort of went after Iraq as a way of getting back at them for the 9/11 attacks. So, I haven't really been following it closely, I don't know the details, and I'm not sure what our main goals are anymore. I think we're trying to build democracy over there, but it feels like that's just a way of making Iraq like us, and we're also sort of using it as an excuse to get control of their oil resources. However, I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep sending our troops over there, because it's causing so much tension and hurting innocent people. It's like, if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, but that's going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up. I'm really not sure what to think.\n\nHonestly, I think the whole thing is kind of pointless now. I'm not even sure why we're still calling it a war when it was never officially declared by Congress. I think that's like, a requirement or something. And I'm not sure what our point is anymore. We're using guns to show that we're powerful and American, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep going. I think we should just call it what it is and try to find a way to get out of there without causing more harm.\n\nBut at the same time, I feel bad for the families of our soldiers who are over there, and I don't want them to get hurt. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end when I know that it's affecting so many people's lives. However, I do think that trying to impose our values and culture on Iraq is just going to make things worse for them in the long run. It's a whole different culture over there, and we're just going to end up causing more problems by trying to change them. And I think that's what's going to make the Al-Kaida thing even worse, and they'll just keep hating us more. So, I think this whole thing is just going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Honestly, I have some reservations about the notion that it's right for the government to declare something as legal or illegal, especially when it comes to issues that are largely under the purview of churches. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone principle in the US constitution, and I believe that trying to impose a particular stance on this issue would be a clear disregard for that fundamental principle.\n\nIn my view, attempting to legislate or enforce powers over these matters would be akin to defying the constitution and its guarantees of separation. Moreover, I think that trying to outlaw something based on the prevailing views of one church or denomination over another would be problematic, given that different churches have varying stances on the issue.\n\nThe fact that some churchgoers, like Catholics, are opposed to the practice while others support it, further underscores the idea that it's not for the government to decide what's allowed or prohibited. The separation of church and state is essential for fostering religious tolerance in the US, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be contradictory to its original intent.\n\nIn fact, I think that such an amendment would be one of the few instances where the government would be restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting its own power. I strongly believe that the government should not be involved in this issue, especially when the push for an amendment seems to be driven by personal views rather than a genuine concern for the welfare of the country.\n\nTo me, it's hard to see how an amendment banning the practice would have a tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that it could have a positive effect by allowing individuals to make their own choices and decisions. Ultimately, I think it's up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government or any particular individual with a personal agenda.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on the war in Iraq, but I've been putting it off because I think the government didn't entirely be truthful with the American people about the reasons for the invasion. In my opinion, they tried to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but the two are not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the effects of 9/11, and that's when the invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nAs someone who's generally against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes, I think the war in Iraq is eerily similar to the Vietnam War in many ways. The US government should have learned from past mistakes, but instead, they seem to be repeating them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is absolutely tragic, and it's not just about the human cost – it's also about the fact that the US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing a country's government. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were predicted, but it seems the government didn't take these consequences into consideration.\n\nThe goal was to install a democratic government in Iraq, something that was also attempted in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that imposing a democracy on a foreign country is never an easy task, especially when faced with a large number of insurgents who are determined to resist. Fighting a war against a country's citizens is a much harder and more complex task than fighting a traditional army. \n\nIn my opinion, the US government was not well-prepared for this situation, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that the war would be a quick and easy victory. We've been in Iraq for over a decade now, and many American troops are still dying, and we're still training the Iraqi troops to police their own country – a process that will likely take years. It's clear that the US government underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful.\n\nLooking back at our own history, democracy was a long and difficult struggle to achieve in the US, with periods of civil war and tension. It's naive to think that the same process would be easy for another country. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and difficult process.\n\nAs for what to do now, it's a tough decision because we've been in Iraq for so long. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken responsibility for, but the cost in American lives and resources is becoming increasingly high. One of the main reasons we invaded Iraq was the promise of a democratic Iraq, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I believe the real reason is the oil issue – it's all about control and resources.\n\nIt's also worth noting that before the invasion, the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which are known to possess such weapons, are not being targeted. It's clear that the US government is not being thorough or truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nI can only hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that there will be peace in the country. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely.",
            "I'm a bit stammering here, but let's get to it – I'm for gay marriage. I've always been, to be honest. I genuinely believe it's a personal preference, and research has shown that it's more biological than sociological. It's not something people have control over, so it's inhumane to deny them rights due to it. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I think it's a matter of personal freedom and equality. \n\nI don't think government or politics should interfere with this issue, as it's a personal, household matter. In my neighborhood, I've seen gay couples living openly, and they function just like any other family – they walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and deserve the same respect as everyone else. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to redefine marriage in his own image, disregarding the complexity of the issue.\n\nResearch suggests that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing. For example, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father might not be predisposed to be gay just because of their environment. It's a matter of biology over sociology.\n\nThe main issue is that marriage is something people should be able to choose privately, without it being a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married in secret, they can do so without anyone knowing, but gay couples are often forced to deal with media attention. This highlights the stark difference between a private, personal issue and a public, national matter.\n\nTo me, it's clear that gay marriage should be a personal, private affair, not something subject to government or national scrutiny.",

            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. When it first started, the goal was understandable – to establish democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original purpose over time. Now, it feels like we're in it just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a powerful nation. I've always questioned the motives behind the war, given the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the intention was indeed to spread democracy, that would be a valid reason, but only if personal agendas weren't involved. Unfortunately, I believe that's not the case. I think we made our statement in the first few months of the war, but now it's been dragged out for far too long – over a year, in fact. We've had more than enough time to achieve our initial goal.\n\nIf we were genuinely trying to bring democracy to a nation ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. It's like we're more invested in the idea of being at war than in achieving a decisive victory or a clear outcome.\n\nI truly believe the war has gone on long enough. At some point, the Iraqi government will have to fend for itself, and I think that time has come. We're draining our economy by spending billions on this war when we have pressing issues on our own turf – poverty, internal conflicts, and infrastructure problems – that desperately need attention and funding. We should be prioritizing these issues instead of throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nIt's astonishing that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not even in our long-term budget. We have real problems that need funding – education, healthcare, public roads, and poverty alleviation. The money would be better spent on addressing these critical issues rather than sacrificing our own citizens in a foreign war that's already lost its cause. I think it's time to acknowledge that.",
            "I'm not sure if I can clarify this, but I was wondering about something. It turns out that someone was able to find out about it because they looked it up online.\n\nOkay, so it's not really an invasion of privacy, right? I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's like sharing it with the world. Like on Myspace, you kind of invite people to be your \"friend\" so they can see your profile. By doing that, you're basically giving them permission to see what you've shared.\n\nAnytime you put something online, you've got to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. So if someone was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from happening because they looked up your online info, that's actually a good thing, right?\n\nHowever, it's a bit of a tricky situation. On one hand, you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent problems. That would be unfair and discriminatory. On the other hand, if someone was specifically looking for info, they might be trying to do something malicious.\n\nI don't know, I guess it all depends on the situation. If someone was just browsing profiles and happened to find something suspicious, that's one thing. But if they were actively looking for evidence of something, that's different.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see all the stuff I've shared. I saw this TV show about a guy who was trying to prove how easily he could get people's info online. He managed to get a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger within minutes. It's scary to think about.\n\nIt's tough because you think people know your interests and other stuff about you, so it's hard to know who's really who online. Even if you limit what you post, there's still a lot of info out there. The thing is, I use Facebook to stay in touch with friends, but it's a trade-off between sharing too much or too little.\n\nI don't know, it's a complicated issue. My roommate was telling me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nI guess that's the only other thought I can think of.",
            "hmm, it's been a bit of a struggle to bring myself to talk about the Iraq War again, but it seems like it's one of those topics that can't be avoided. I'm aware that I might sound hypocritical, but I've been thinking a lot about this issue, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were opposed to the war from the start. I mean, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people, both in the US and globally, thought the war was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who refused to acknowledge their own mistakes.\n\nI've been following the polls, and it's evident that over 75-80% of the world's population, including Iraqis, US troops, and people from other parts of the globe, think that the war was a disaster. Even the soldiers on the ground consider it a bad idea and think we should withdraw within a year. It's been a complete mess since before we even intervened, and now the idea of pulling out seems just as catastrophic. The Middle East has always been a complex region, and the culture clash between the US and these countries is a significant contributor to our struggles there. It's not that I think Saddam was a good guy - he wasn't - but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a quagmire like it has.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq right now, and I haven't heard a compelling argument from the administration that convinces me otherwise. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I'm not opposed to that, but I just don't see any reason to stay any longer than we should. The fact that 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter of them think we should leave now, makes me wonder if we're listening to the people we're trying to help. I think they might know better than we do, and if we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. It's better to be the ones who made the decision to leave rather than being stuck in a situation where we're not making progress.",
            "You know, I think gender discrimination is still a pretty big issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; it's more related to the specific field of work you're in. For instance, even though there's supposed to be equality, women often face it tougher because of the \"glass ceiling\" - it's hard for men to find a job under a woman in charge, mainly because of how society's been raised over time. In the workplace, women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in leadership positions. \n\nIt's the same with men in certain industries, like being a stay-at-home dad, which is still not common. When a man decides to take on this role, people often look down on him because society expects men to be the breadwinners. It's tough on them because they might want to be involved in raising their kids and helping their partner with their career. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's another form of discrimination - people often don't take straight men seriously if they're interested in fashion. It's because traditionally, men who like fashion tend to have different lifestyles, and people might question whether they truly understand fashion or not. It's a bit like they're saying, \"How can I trust what you know about fashion if you can't even speak like a 'real' woman?\" It's weird, I know, but it's a thing.\n\nThe thing is, depending on the field of work, there's definitely gender discrimination in society. Changing this is difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is slow. It's happening, though, as women rise to leadership positions and become more accepted in the business world. The same goes for stay-at-home dads - people are starting to realize that maybe the female partner has the better job or wants to be the one working. \n\nTo promote change, you have to show people the good qualities of the people who are usually discriminated against without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good balance now where it's starting to become more accepted. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against, not just based on gender, but also based on where they're from or their education level. For instance, someone who grew up on a farm might have poor grammar but be extremely intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their grammar, even though they're incredibly smart. It's another example of how people can be discriminated against based on their background or education level.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out whether they legalized it or just decriminalized it. From what I understand, they took it down from a crime to something more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and booked. While this might seem like a good thing, I think people still worry about the long-term effects, even after decriminalization. I mean, a marijuana charge can still affect job prospects and other things, which can be pretty bad.\n\nHowever, there's another side to this. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and then let them go. Plus, there's the cost of court appearances, public defenders, and other expenses. When a city is financially struggling, they might not be willing to give up that money, even if it would free up some funds for other things.\n\nDenver's a bit of an exception, though. People there tend to be more open-minded and willing to try new things. And I think that's worked out okay for them, as they've been able to use the saved money for education, social programs, and other good causes.\n\nOf course, there are still valid reasons not to have marijuana everywhere. I'm not sure how I'd feel if it was totally legalized, to be honest. I mean, it could be sold in gas stations like cigarettes, and people might start smoking and driving, which wouldn't be great. Plus, it's still not really accepted in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward.\n\nI also think that marijuana can have some pretty significant effects on people's lifestyles, even if it doesn't necessarily affect their decision-making skills as much as alcohol does. But, like with anything, people react differently, and some folks are just more... let's say, resilient than others. So, it's hard to make general statements about the substance.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "So, I'd say yes to the idea of adapting certain traditional practices, considering they've been followed for a long time. It's good to have some roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be open to change. The thing is, a lot of Catholics believe in sticking to their weekly church attendance and being very strict about their practices. However, it often feels like they look down on those who don't follow their doctrine to the letter, and they don't accept people with different beliefs or those from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my parents are a good example - my mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. They wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they weren't allowed to because of my dad's religion. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is a fundamental principle. It's hypocritical when you say you're supposed to love others but then exclude them because of their differences. I think the Catholic Church often gets stuck on outdated ideas and sticks to them even though they contradict their own teachings.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not sure it would make a difference in the way some priests behave. It's a separate issue altogether. Even if priests were allowed to marry, some might still engage in certain behaviors because it's about the nature of their actions, not their marital status. So, in this case, I'm not convinced that allowing priests to get married would necessarily prevent those issues from happening.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this complex issue. I'm not quite sure which side has the stronger argument, but I do think this is one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. The line between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a tough one to tread without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm still undecided on how to approach it - all I know is that civil unions sound like a good starting point. I'm not convinced that marriage should be seen as a purely government-defined institution, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament by many people. If that's the case, then why would the government care about what kind of marriage it is? It's just about two people committing to each other, and that's what a civil union is. It shouldn't matter what the government thinks about the type of marriage it is - it's just about two people uniting.\n\nAs for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people entering into a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then they should push for it to become federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure to me. It's a big issue for some people, but not big enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's not a vital enough issue to redefine the constitution and ban gay marriage. To put it simply, I'm just not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to think.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a complicated view on homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. On one hand, I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it hard for me to take a firm stance against it. However, I still have some reservations about the lifestyle. Despite this, I think it should be legalized and not be a national issue that the president decides for the entire country. I believe that each state should have the freedom to make its own decision on the matter.\n\nI understand that some states are democratic and others are republican, and it's likely that democratic states will support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or bans gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with the decision. It's ultimately up to the individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves.\n\nWhat I do think is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. Given this, I believe that the decision on gay marriage should be left to each state to decide for themselves. I also think it's unfair for the president to impose his opinion on the whole country. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so why should he decide how each one runs itself? Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide for themselves, as they'll be the ones living with the consequences of that decision.",
            "Here's the issue - I don't want to post right now because I'm trying to figure out how to get my thoughts across, but essentially, I want to talk about Myspace and why I think school officials could have accessed my information on it. I suppose it's a public platform, like a bulletin board where you can post for everyone to see, and that's okay, but what if school officials see it? They could have checked it from home, even if it wasn't associated with the school's name. \n\nMy opinion is that if it means saving lives and keeping students safe, it's okay for them to check, even if it feels like an invasion of privacy. It's their responsibility to prevent school shootings, like what happened at Columbine. If they check Myspace to see if students are doing stuff they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay too, as long as it's not just to get them in trouble.\n\nIt's easy to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess that's not the point. It's a public thing, and if you post something on Myspace and don't expect to get in trouble, that's a bit naive. I'm worried about posting stuff online because I know it can come back to haunt me. If I post something negative about someone, it could be found later and cause problems. \n\nIf you do something as a college student that's not good, it can follow you later and get you in trouble. Once something's on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. School officials might not be looking for trouble, but if they find something that helps make the school a safer place, that's okay. They're just doing their job, like teachers who have to prepare for lockdowns and other safety measures.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that it's a public platform, but school officials have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, that's okay. They're not just trying to catch students, they're trying to prevent bad things from happening. I think that's a reasonable thing to do.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about the war and my initial reaction to it. I have to admit that I was fully on board with it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to see justice served and to create chaos in response to what happened over here. However, I think we got caught up in the emotions of the situation and overlooked the bigger picture. We charged in without a clear plan, and I genuinely believe that backfired on us.\n\nNow, I've done a complete turnaround and I'm strongly against the war. In my opinion, it didn't achieve anything. The people over there are too busy fighting among themselves to pose a threat to us, so our presence is doing more harm than good. The fact that they can't even put aside their differences to work together is quite telling.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 has left me with a sense of apathy towards the conflict in the Middle East. I struggle to care about their struggles because their concept of war is so different from ours. They seem to be more focused on driving us out than on improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them figure out their own problems.\n\nI believe our initial decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge and a knee-jerk reaction to the traumatic event. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand where he was coming from, I think we were ill-prepared for the consequences. We didn't have a clear plan for creating order or establishing a unified front. This lack of vision and unity ultimately led to more chaos and division.\n\nLooking back, I think we should have taken a more measured approach and had a solid plan in place before invading. In the end, I don't believe we're equipped to change the people of Iraq. They've been a complex and fragmented society for centuries, and it's unlikely that we can force them to become something else. Our continued presence is only exacerbating the situation, and I think we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nIt's a complex issue, and I don't have any easy answers. However, I do know that we need to reassess our role in the conflict and focus on finding a way out. The longer we stay, the more we'll be contributing to the instability and chaos in the region. It's time for us to acknowledge that we can't stay forever and start making plans for a peaceful exit."
