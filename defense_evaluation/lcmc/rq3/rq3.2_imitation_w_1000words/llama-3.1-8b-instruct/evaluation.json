            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "i think the catholic church really needs to reevaluate its stance on certain issues. they're experiencing a decline in followers, and i believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. for instance, their rigid views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite outdated and may be driving people away. if they adapted to a more modern perspective, they might not lose their followers. many people are turning against the church due to its traditional views on these matters. those who disagree with the church on these subjects may not feel comfortable being part of a community where such views are strongly emphasized. this could lead to people leaving the church because they feel they're going against its teachings. i don't see why the church can't reconsider its stance on issues like female priests or priests being able to get married. it's possible that if they allowed priests to have personal relationships, it might not have changed the outcome, but it's worth exploring. however, the church's stance on these topics seems archaic, and it's hard to understand why they can't find a middle ground. they claim that priests are married to god and devoted to their faith, but they're essentially denying them a normal life with a family and loved ones, just like everyone else.",
            "Honestly, I'll be the first to admit that I haven't fully given much thought to the issue of gay marriage. However, I'm not opposed to the idea in principle. I think people, regardless of their sexual orientation, shouldn't be held accountable for who they are. It's not like being gay is a choice that someone makes consciously. I believe people are born with their orientation, and it's not something they should be penalized for. To deny gay couples the right to marriage while allowing opposite-sex couples to do so just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nOn a deeper level, the idea that people's sexual orientation is not a choice seems obvious. Think about it - I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not as if they have control over it. This lack of control means they shouldn't be held responsible for who they are.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government shouldn't be involved in issues like this. It's not a matter of law or morality; it's simply about giving people the freedom to be who they are. I don't think it's fair to put people on a pedestal and imply they made a wrong decision or choice. Gay people aren't doing anything wrong; they're just existing and being themselves.\n\nFrankly, I think the federal government is out of place here. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's simply a matter of people's personal lives. They shouldn't be intervened in or judged based on their orientation. It's who they are, and that's not something they should be punished for.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "I'm in favor of legalizing gay marriage because there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but that's not true. It's like saying heads will never be tails - they're two sides of the same coin. While people may have different views on the matter, there are many civil rights at stake, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a gay couple is together, their partner shouldn't be denied the right to be with them in the hospital or visit them when they're sick.\n\nThe fact is, scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship, such as communication, trust, and commitment. It's not about getting married in a church; it's about obtaining a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, it's hard to argue against granting marriage to gay couples. It's essentially segregation, separate but unequal. People worry about adoption issues and community concerns, but these concerns are unfounded. Gay couples can be just as good parents as heterosexual couples, and their children will face the same challenges in school and society.\n\nIn fact, some cities, like New York, have already implemented programs to support children of gay parents, such as special schools to protect them from bullying and harassment. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about the quality of care and parenting skills.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is hypocritical, considering the government's stance on other issues, such as stem cell research and the Pledge of Allegiance. It's unacceptable to enforce religious standards on an entire country while ignoring the moral and cultural diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to institutions that conduct research and studies, rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Well, I've got a bit of a soapbox moment here, so bear with me. As a pharmacy intern in a hospital over the summer, I've had some time to think about the whole issue of illegal substances. Now, just because something's on the list of forbidden substances doesn't mean it's inherently bad. Take it for what it's worth, I think it's fair to say that some illegal drugs have real benefits.\n\nIn fact, pharmacies like the one I'm working at use controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets all the time because they're proven to help people. And let's be real, if we're going to dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana because of its illegality, that's just a cop-out. We should be able to explore its medicinal uses without fear of judgment.\n\nI'm not saying it's identical to alcohol, which can be abused and lead to all sorts of problems. But if we're honest, marijuana isn't exactly the same. If we could create a more nuanced view of marijuana, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, maybe people would use it more responsibly. After all, it's not like it's heroin or cocaine – it's not that toxic.\n\nMy point is, getting rid of the negative stigma surrounding marijuana might be the first step towards using it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes. If we could move past the 'terrifying illicit substance' image, people might be more likely to use it in a way that's not detrimental to their health.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has made some adjustments to fit into the 21st century. It's not as traditional as it used to be. Growing up, I used to go to church every Sunday, and it was a big deal - I'd get dressed up in matching outfits, including a cute little dress, shoes, and a purse. It was a big part of my private school experience, where I'd see all my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, I've noticed some changes. They've introduced a shorter, 30-minute mass for teenagers, and it's become more casual. People often dress down, especially in the summer, and even families who run late still show up. It's become a more relaxed atmosphere, even during morning masses where people used to dress up. I've noticed that people now wear jeans and khakis, which is still nice, but it's a more casual vibe overall.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the shift in the church's atmosphere. I'm not familiar with the church's politics, but that's my observation. As for the recent scandals involving Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not about the marriage or lack thereof - it's about the individual's attraction to young kids. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their personal decision, and there are other faiths that allow their leaders to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, perhaps they should consider a different denomination.\n\nI was asked to elaborate on my answer, and I think it boils down to the idea that pedophilia is more about genetics than environmental factors. People are born with their inclinations, and you can't change that through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and covered them up, that's a problem, but I don't think they were aware of everything in all cases. As for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments.",
            "Honestly, at first, I wasn't entirely opposed to the premise, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the September 11th attacks was still a sensitive time, and we kind of got sidetracked into Iraq for reasons that weren't entirely genuine. The Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since been revealed that these claims were false.\n\nTo be frank, this really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems to me that the Bush administration has lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it, even with Colin Powell admitting he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a serious abuse of power and, in my opinion, an impeachable offense.\n\nIt's also disturbing to see the administration disregard the constitution and try to undermine it since 9/11. I think they came into office with the intention of going to war, despite the supposed pretext of WMDs and a connection to 9/11. In fact, it's been suggested that younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and that he wanted to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded motive.\n\nI think the war has dragged on for too long, but withdrawing now would have its own set of problems, as there's a risk that the country would descend into civil war and more people would lose their lives. The alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It's likely to create more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty becomes an increasingly contentious issue. The interim government is already showing signs of disintegration, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control. The presence of radical elements, like Mugtada al-Sadr's party with 20 seats in Parliament, is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I'm struggling to articulate my concerns in a polite manner.",
            "i was supposed to write something about my thoughts on the war in iraq, but it's really hard to form a coherent opinion on the topic. to be honest, i'm not even sure what's going on over there anymore. from what i understand, it started as a kind of get-back reaction because we thought iraq was behind the nine eleven attacks. but now it seems like we're just trying to set up a democracy in iraq, which sounds like a nice idea, but it's a lot harder to achieve than it sounds. \n\ni'm not really an expert on the war, but it seems like we're just causing more problems by being there. i mean, we're using a lot of resources, and it's making everyone upset. if we stay, we'll have to try and create a democracy, which will take a long time, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up. it's a tough spot to be in.\n\ni've been trying to think about this for a while, but it's just really hard to wrap my head around it. i don't even know if i should be calling it a war anymore, since it wasn't even declared by congress. i think that's how it's supposed to work, right? \n\ni guess my opinion is that it's a pointless thing to stay in iraq, but at the same time, i feel bad for all the families whose kids are over there fighting. it's like, i want them to be safe, but at the same time, we're kind of destroying their country and culture. it's hard to say what's the right thing to do. \n\ni feel like the war is going to go on for a long time, and it's just going to get worse and worse. it's already making us look bad, and it's just causing more and more problems. it's hard to know what to think, but i guess that's my two cents on the matter.\n\ni think the whole thing would be a lot simpler if we just declared it a war and got it over with, but that's not how it works. it's like, we're trying to turn iraq into a second u.s., but that's not going to work. it's just going to make things worse, and it's going to fuel the al-qaeda thing even more. i don't know, it's just a mess.\n\nanyway, that's my attempt at forming an opinion on the war in iraq. i'm not exactly sure what to think, but i hope that's a start.",
            "To be honest, I have strong reservations about the government declaring something as legal or not. I believe it's more the domain of churches to decide these matters, given the separation of church and state as outlined in the constitution. This principle is crystal clear, and any attempt to impose power over it would essentially defy the constitution's written words. \n\nIn my opinion, those trying to make it illegal are essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. The fact that most Catholics and Christians don't support it, except in a few areas, speaks volumes. It doesn't seem right for the government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Proposing an amendment to address this issue seems counterintuitive, as it would contradict the constitution's existing provisions. Furthermore, it would likely be the only amendment restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs, which raises the concern that he's favoring one religion over others. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not the government or its officials. There's little justification for the amendment beyond personal views, and I fail to see how it would positively impact the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive effect on society, so I don't think there's a valid reason to pursue it.\n\nI've expressed my main points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "Okay, I was thinking about the war in Iraq, and I believe the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for invading the country before going in. It seemed like there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which wasn't entirely accurate. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the invasion, and it began in 2003.\n\nTo start, I'm not a fan of war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq has a lot of parallels with the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes and not repeated them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is tragic and unacceptable.\n\nWhen the US invaded Iraq, they removed the country's government without being prepared for the aftermath or the power vacuum that would follow. It's like trying to impose a democratic government without considering the potential consequences. They were trying to do the same thing in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and establishing democracy.\n\nHowever, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process. It's not something that can be achieved easily, especially when you're fighting an insurgency rather than a conventional army. You're fighting ordinary citizens who are resisting the occupation, making it extremely difficult to put them down.\n\nI think the government rushed into war without being adequately prepared for the outcome, and that's been a major issue. If we're going to go to war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government failed to do this, and we're still dealing with the consequences. Many American troops are still in Iraq, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to take control of their country.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government tried to deceive the American people by making it seem like the invasion would be a quick and successful operation. However, it's not that simple. Implementing a new form of government takes time, and it's not something that can be achieved overnight. We're naive to think it would be easy, especially when we consider our own country's history with democracy.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated issue, and there's no easy solution. If I had to vote in the 2004 presidential election, one of my reservations about voting for George Bush was that he would finish what he started. However, it's hard to abandon a country after being involved for so long, especially when we've taken away their government and way of life.\n\nOn the other hand, it's impossible to ignore the number of American casualties and the risk of further losses. We need to consider the cost of continuing the war and whether it's worth it for the sake of a free democratic Iraq. If we're making the case that Iraq needs democracy, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the real reason is the oil issue and controlling resources. The US government's decisions are often driven by self-interest and a desire for power.\n\nIn conclusion, I just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that peace is restored. However, I'm not optimistic about the situation, and it's likely that it will take a long time to resolve.",
            "Well, let me get this straight - I'm all for gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal choice, and I think it's ridiculous that people are still debating this. With all the evidence that shows it's not just a social construct, but something that could be biological, it's inhumane to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI'm not sure why the government and politicians are even involved in this. It's a personal issue, not a state or national concern. I mean, take my neighborhood for instance - there are at least two openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and what's the difference? I think it's absurd that President Bush is trying to dictate what marriage means and imposing his own interpretation on the rest of us.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's a growing body of evidence that suggests there's a chemical component to being gay, something that's not just a product of upbringing or environment. It's not like being gay is a choice, it's a natural part of who people are. So, I just don't get why it's such a big deal.\n\nIt's not like straight couples need to jump through hoops to get married. If a guy and a girl want to get hitched, they can just elope in Vegas and nobody bats an eye, but if two gay people want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's splashed all over the national news.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Well, I'm here to give you a reality check - when you post something online, it's essentially public domain. You can't expect your personal opinions or actions to remain private. As someone who's dealt with this firsthand as a resident advisor, I can attest to the fact that anything you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. This can be particularly problematic when you're discussing sensitive or serious topics like violence or shootings. Someone, somewhere, will inevitably stumble upon it and react.\n\nThe internet is a vast, open space that's accessible to everyone, including your friends and acquaintances on social media platforms. Whether it's a bulletin on Myspace or a post on Facebook, it's not just a school or institution that's exposed to it - it's the entire online community. If something serious enough is posted, it can put people on high alert, and as you can imagine, schools and institutions can't just ignore these warnings.\n\nIt's a delicate line to walk because, on the one hand, some people might be joking or engaging in a social experiment, while others might be genuinely expressing their thoughts or concerns. Take the recent incident at our school, for example, where someone overheard a comment and reported it, leading to a deeper investigation. It turned out that a student had posted some concerning content on their social media profiles that they never intended to be taken seriously, but in hindsight, it became a serious issue.\n\nWhen you post something online, you should be aware that there's no such thing as true online privacy. If you don't want your thoughts or actions to be public knowledge, it's best not to post them in the first place. You can't control how people interpret your online presence, but you can control what you put out there. School officials, for instance, shouldn't be friending their students on social media or snooping through their profiles - that's just not their place.\n\nHowever, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a different story if they're monitoring private communications like phone conversations or texts without consent. But if it's something that's publicly available, they can't just ignore it.\n\nAs a residential advisor, I wouldn't even think of friending my residents on social media, not because I'm concerned about their online activities, but because I don't want to be privy to that information. That's not my place, and I'd rather not have to deal with the potential consequences. So, to sum it up, be mindful of what you post online because it can have real-world implications.",
            "I'm starting to feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the idea seemed to be a good one – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original goal. Instead, it feels like we're fighting for the sake of being a global superpower, just to prove a point. I'm also concerned that the real motives behind the war were questionable from the start, considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, as long as there weren't any personal agendas involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective in the first few months, and that was a significant statement in itself.\n\nThe fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, or even several years, is just too much. I believe our purpose has been slowly eroded over time, and it's now more about being at war for the sake of being at war. We're not looking for a decisive end or a victory; we just don't want to lose face.\n\nI think it's time for us to call it quits. The Iraqi government will eventually have to take care of itself, and our continued involvement is just draining our economy. We're spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose, while we have our own problems to address, such as poverty and internal issues like public roads, schools, and healthcare. It seems like a waste of resources to be spending that money on a war that's not achieving its original goal.\n\nIt's astounding to think that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not in our long-term budget. We have our own problems to solve at home, and it's time for us to focus on those. Our citizens are dying in a foreign country, and it's just not worth it.",
            "I wanted to clarify a point, but I'm not sure if I should even bring it up. Apparently, someone online discovered that there was a reason certain information was being kept from the public. Okay, so here's my question: if you post stuff on the internet, like on Myspace, for instance, you have to accept that a lot of people are going to see it. I mean, if you want to be friends with someone on Myspace, you basically give them permission to view your profile, right? So, anytime you put info on the internet, you have to understand that it's out there for anyone to see.\n\nIt's a bit of a tough situation because, on one hand, you can't have someone sitting around all day monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening, but on the other hand, it's like, what if they're just looking for evidence of someone doing something wrong? It's not clear-cut. I mean, I don't think it's right to have someone's job just to snoop through people's profiles, but I guess it depends on the circumstances.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's a bit unsettling to think that there are people out there who can see things about me just by looking at my profile. I saw this thing on TV once where this guy was showing how easy it is to get information about someone online. He went onto this girl's Myspace profile and got her screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. It's pretty scary.\n\nIt's hard to balance the fact that you want to be able to communicate with your friends online, but at the same time, you don't want to put too much information out there that could be used against you. I've noticed that some of my classmates can IM me without even knowing my screen name, which is a bit unnerving. They know a lot about me from my profile, including my class schedule and what my friends are like. I've tried to limit what I put up, but it's a tricky balance to strike.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she said that in her high school, students were banned from having Myspace accounts. I'm not sure how the school had the right to do that, and it seemed a bit unfair. I'm not sure if that's a real privacy issue, but it did strike me as strange.",
            "I struggled with whether to bring up the Iraq War topic, but I guess I have to eventually. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's not really a crucial issue anymore, as everyone except the Bush administration seems to agree that it was a bad idea. Looking at the recent polls, it's clear that the majority of the world population thinks so, with around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops in Iraq all sharing this sentiment. It's hard to argue with the fact that the conflict has been a disaster since before our involvement, and now it's a challenge to find a solution that won't make things worse.\n\nI believe the underlying issue is the deep cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern states, which makes it difficult for our administration to understand the local perspective. It's naive to think we can impose democracy on an area where it's not naturally embraced. While Saddam was a bad guy, we should have carefully weighed the pros and cons before invading. The situation has turned into a quagmire, and I don't see a reason for us to stay any longer. I'm not convinced by the administration's arguments about the potential problems that might arise from our withdrawal, and I'd love to hear a legitimate reason to stay.\n\nIf the administration plans to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I just can't see the justification for prolonging our presence. It's even more ironic that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're essentially telling us to leave. I think they might know better than us, and at least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the enemy in the Middle East.",
            "you know, i think gender discrimination is still an issue in the US.  it's not just a women's problem, though - it's more complex than that.  i believe it's often tied to the specific industry or work environment, and how long it's traditionally been male-dominated.  for instance, in business, women face a 'glass ceiling' where they might have all the qualifications for a job, but are overlooked for promotions due to ingrained societal attitudes. \n\nthe same can be said for men in certain industries, like fashion, where being a stay-at-home parent is often viewed as unusual and not masculine.  it's a common stereotype that men should be the breadwinners, and people look down on them if they choose to take on more domestic responsibilities.  this can be tough for men who want to be involved in childcare and support their families, but are judged for their choices. \n\nin fashion, there's also the issue of men being taken seriously if they're interested in it as a career.  people often doubt their credibility because of societal expectations around masculinity and style.  it's like, how can you truly understand fashion if you're a guy?  the same goes for men who don't fit the typical mold of masculinity.\n\nsocietal attitudes and mindsets are hard to change, and it's a slow process.  we've made progress, but it's still a work in progress.  women are breaking into leadership positions and being accepted in the business world, and more men are choosing to be stay-at-home dads.  as we continue to push for change, it's essential to promote the qualities and strengths of those who are often stereotyped or overlooked.  we need to do this in a way that's not pushy or aggressive, but rather by showcasing their abilities and potential. \n\nit's all about finding a balance and promoting acceptance, rather than forcing it.  we're at a good point where it's starting to become more mainstream, but change takes time.  i'm not sure what more we can do, as it seems like we're already seeing progress.  it's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and with varying levels of education can face discrimination, not just based on gender but also on other factors like socioeconomic status, education level, or geographical location.",
            "It seems that many people misunderstand the recent changes to the law regarding this substance.  To clarify, it was decriminalized, not fully legalized. In other words, it's no longer a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, akin to a traffic ticket. You might get cited and fined without facing the full penalties of arrest and prosecution.\n\nOne issue people often worry about when it comes to decriminalization is the potential long-term consequences, such as difficulties in job interviews and other professional situations. These repercussions can still linger even after decriminalization. However, some argue that the costs associated with arresting and processing individuals, including courtroom appearances and public defender fees, can be substantial.\n\nFrom a budgetary perspective, many municipalities struggle to justify the expense of enforcing this law. Even if it would lead to significant cost savings, some communities may not be willing to make this change, especially if they're strongly opposed to the substance.\n\nOn the other hand, places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, might find it reasonable to decriminalize it. As a result, they could potentially redirect funds to more pressing needs, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and services for the homeless.\n\nIt's essential to consider the financial implications, as well as other factors, when discussing this topic. While marijuana shouldn't be allowed to be ubiquitous, the financial element does play a role in the decision-making process. Some people might be concerned that if it were fully legalized, it could lead to widespread use and potentially problematic behaviors, like driving under the influence. However, it's also true that many people view marijuana as taboo, and making it widely available might be awkward for some.\n\nIn general, both marijuana and alcohol have their negative effects, but they can impact people differently. Some might be more susceptible to the lifestyle consequences of marijuana use, while others may be more affected by its impact on motor skills. Ultimately, everyone's reaction to substances is unique, and it's difficult to make broad generalizations.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree [REWRITE]However, [REWRITE]There are many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church that have remained consistent over time, and [REWRITE]it's great to see these enduring practices [REWRITE]But at the same time, it's essential to be open to change [REWRITE]Many Catholics adhere to the idea of attending church every week, and [REWRITE]they're quite particular about how things are done [REWRITE]Sometimes, though, I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine [REWRITE]Furthermore, they don't accept individuals who aren't flawless Catholics or those from other faiths [REWRITE]For example, my parents' interfaith marriage was not recognized in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background [REWRITE]This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, given the Catholic emphasis on loving others [REWRITE]It's like they're preaching one thing but not practicing it [REWRITE]The disconnect between doctrine and practice is a significant issue, especially when it's rooted in outdated ideas [REWRITE]Despite this, they continue to stick with these outdated practices [REWRITE]Personally, I think it would be beneficial to allow priests to marry [REWRITE]However, I'm not convinced that this would prevent pedophilic behavior [REWRITE]Those who engage in such acts likely wouldn't be deterred by marriage [REWRITE]It's a different dynamic altogether, and [REWRITE]I don't think allowing priests to be married would necessarily make a difference [REWRITE]In other words, child abuse is a separate issue that wouldn't be resolved by allowing priests to marry [REWRITE]It's a complex problem that requires a more comprehensive approach [REWRITE]",
            "so i haven't made up my mind on this yet, but it's a pretty tricky topic. the lines between separation of church and state are getting blurred, and defining marriage has become a really touchy issue. on one hand, you have civil unions, which i think are a good alternative, but on the other hand, you have this whole idea of marriage as a sacrament that's deeply rooted in faith. if that's the case, people don't get tax breaks or any special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. so i'm inclined to think that marriage should be viewed as a civil union, a union between two people, without any government interference in what that union is or isn't.\n\nthe thing is, the fact that gay marriage is even a debate is a bit of a non-starter. if two people want to get married, or enter into a civil union, it's really no one's business but theirs. and if the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should make it federal law. but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? that just seems like overkill. it's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution.\n\nit's not like it's some huge, earth-shattering cause that's worth amending the constitution over. it's just not that important. and to be honest, it's pretty ridiculous to try to define marriage in the constitution in the first place. i'm not even sure what to say to that.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to a somewhat mixed perspective on homosexuality for me. On one hand, I have many close gay friends, so it's hard for me to take a one-dimensional stance on the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't believe it's a matter for the federal government to decide; rather, each state should have the autonomy to make its own decision.\n\nConsidering the diversity of our country, with some states being more liberal and others more conservative, it's likely that each state will have its own stance on gay marriage. If you live in a state that has already legalized it, I don't think you should disagree with the decision, as you have chosen to reside there and should respect the local laws. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, and therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left up to individual states.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but to reiterate, I don't think the president should be able to impose their will on the entire country in regards to this issue. President Bush's ban on gay marriage doesn't sit well with me, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't dictate how each one runs itself. It would be more productive to let the states decide for themselves. Plus, with the president's term coming to an end soon, the issue will likely be revisited, and it's better to let each state make its own decision rather than having it change every time the presidency switches hands. It's the states that will have to live with the consequences of this decision, not the president.",
            "Honestly, I'm finding it difficult to articulate my thoughts on this issue. Let me break it down for you. MySpace, like the internet in general, is a public platform where you post content for others to see. If you put something online, you have to accept that people will view it, including school officials. Even if you post under a pseudonym, they could still access it from their homes. In a situation where it might prevent a school shooting, I believe they have every right to do so. Their primary responsibility is to ensure student safety.\n\nIn fact, if school officials monitor Myspace to identify students engaging in prohibited activities, I think that's perfectly fine. It's their job to maintain a safe environment, and if that means keeping an eye on students' online behavior, so be it. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and invading students' privacy. However, if the monitoring leads to a safer school environment, I don't consider it an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but I'll try to summarize. Posting on Myspace is like sharing information with the public. If you're worried about getting in trouble for something you post, it's not unreasonable. Once something is online, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. This is something I'm cautious about, even in emails.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, and if that means monitoring Myspace or other online platforms, I'm okay with it. In fact, I've discussed this with a teacher of mine, and they feel the same way. They have to be prepared for potential threats, like lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. In a way, this incident was similar, as they were trying to prevent something like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn short, I think school officials were justified in monitoring Myspace to ensure student safety. They were simply doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. That's all I wanted to say on the matter.",
            "I guess I've been a bit quiet lately because I'm still trying to process my thoughts on the war. To be honest, my initial reaction after 9/11 was to support it. I was personally affected, and I felt like we needed to take action and show them that their actions wouldn't be tolerated. I think we went in there with a lot of emotions and anger, which clouded our judgment. We didn't really think about the long-term consequences or have a clear plan, which ultimately led to things not going as smoothly as we had hoped.\n\nI've since changed my mind and I'm now firmly against the war. I don't think it's done anything to help the situation, and in fact, I think it's made things worse. The people over there are fighting amongst themselves, so us being there isn't really accomplishing anything. It's like they're more focused on fighting each other than working towards a common goal, and I just don't see how us being there is making a difference.\n\nTo be blunt, I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel like we're just throwing our money and lives away for no reason. I've come to realize that war is a completely different beast when you're not the one waging it. The people over there have a completely different mindset, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, but rather get rid of us.\n\nLooking back, I think we went in there on a mission of revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. I think President Bush was swept up in the emotional response to 9/11 and declared war on Iraq without a clear plan in place. At the time, I understood where he was coming from, but now I think we should have taken a more measured approach.\n\nI don't think we could have just let things go after 9/11, but I do think we could have done a better job of planning and executing our strategy. There was a lack of unity and clear direction, and that's something that would have made a big difference. As it stands, I think we're just making things worse and hurting ourselves more than anyone else.\n\nWe're not the ones to change the people over there; they're going to be who they are, and we're not going to be able to fix that. I think we're just delaying the inevitable by staying there, and it's time for us to leave. We're not making enough progress, and once we do leave, things will likely collapse. I think we're just wasting our time and resources by staying, and it's time to cut our losses."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "i think the catholic church really needs to reevaluate its stance on certain issues. they're experiencing a decline in followers, and i believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. for instance, their rigid views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite outdated and may be driving people away. if they adapted to a more modern perspective, they might not lose their followers. many people are turning against the church due to its traditional views on these matters. those who disagree with the church on these subjects may not feel comfortable being part of a community where such views are strongly emphasized. this could lead to people leaving the church because they feel they're going against its teachings. i don't see why the church can't reconsider its stance on issues like female priests or priests being able to get married. it's possible that if they allowed priests to have personal relationships, it might not have changed the outcome, but it's worth exploring. however, the church's stance on these topics seems archaic, and it's hard to understand why they can't find a middle ground. they claim that priests are married to god and devoted to their faith, but they're essentially denying them a normal life with a family and loved ones, just like everyone else.",
            "Honestly, I'll be the first to admit that I haven't fully given much thought to the issue of gay marriage. However, I'm not opposed to the idea in principle. I think people, regardless of their sexual orientation, shouldn't be held accountable for who they are. It's not like being gay is a choice that someone makes consciously. I believe people are born with their orientation, and it's not something they should be penalized for. To deny gay couples the right to marriage while allowing opposite-sex couples to do so just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nOn a deeper level, the idea that people's sexual orientation is not a choice seems obvious. Think about it - I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not as if they have control over it. This lack of control means they shouldn't be held responsible for who they are.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government shouldn't be involved in issues like this. It's not a matter of law or morality; it's simply about giving people the freedom to be who they are. I don't think it's fair to put people on a pedestal and imply they made a wrong decision or choice. Gay people aren't doing anything wrong; they're just existing and being themselves.\n\nFrankly, I think the federal government is out of place here. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's simply a matter of people's personal lives. They shouldn't be intervened in or judged based on their orientation. It's who they are, and that's not something they should be punished for.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "I'm in favor of legalizing gay marriage because there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but that's not true. It's like saying heads will never be tails - they're two sides of the same coin. While people may have different views on the matter, there are many civil rights at stake, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a gay couple is together, their partner shouldn't be denied the right to be with them in the hospital or visit them when they're sick.\n\nThe fact is, scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship, such as communication, trust, and commitment. It's not about getting married in a church; it's about obtaining a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, it's hard to argue against granting marriage to gay couples. It's essentially segregation, separate but unequal. People worry about adoption issues and community concerns, but these concerns are unfounded. Gay couples can be just as good parents as heterosexual couples, and their children will face the same challenges in school and society.\n\nIn fact, some cities, like New York, have already implemented programs to support children of gay parents, such as special schools to protect them from bullying and harassment. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about the quality of care and parenting skills.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is hypocritical, considering the government's stance on other issues, such as stem cell research and the Pledge of Allegiance. It's unacceptable to enforce religious standards on an entire country while ignoring the moral and cultural diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to institutions that conduct research and studies, rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Well, I've got a bit of a soapbox moment here, so bear with me. As a pharmacy intern in a hospital over the summer, I've had some time to think about the whole issue of illegal substances. Now, just because something's on the list of forbidden substances doesn't mean it's inherently bad. Take it for what it's worth, I think it's fair to say that some illegal drugs have real benefits.\n\nIn fact, pharmacies like the one I'm working at use controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets all the time because they're proven to help people. And let's be real, if we're going to dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana because of its illegality, that's just a cop-out. We should be able to explore its medicinal uses without fear of judgment.\n\nI'm not saying it's identical to alcohol, which can be abused and lead to all sorts of problems. But if we're honest, marijuana isn't exactly the same. If we could create a more nuanced view of marijuana, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, maybe people would use it more responsibly. After all, it's not like it's heroin or cocaine – it's not that toxic.\n\nMy point is, getting rid of the negative stigma surrounding marijuana might be the first step towards using it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes. If we could move past the 'terrifying illicit substance' image, people might be more likely to use it in a way that's not detrimental to their health.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has made some adjustments to fit into the 21st century. It's not as traditional as it used to be. Growing up, I used to go to church every Sunday, and it was a big deal - I'd get dressed up in matching outfits, including a cute little dress, shoes, and a purse. It was a big part of my private school experience, where I'd see all my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, I've noticed some changes. They've introduced a shorter, 30-minute mass for teenagers, and it's become more casual. People often dress down, especially in the summer, and even families who run late still show up. It's become a more relaxed atmosphere, even during morning masses where people used to dress up. I've noticed that people now wear jeans and khakis, which is still nice, but it's a more casual vibe overall.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the shift in the church's atmosphere. I'm not familiar with the church's politics, but that's my observation. As for the recent scandals involving Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not about the marriage or lack thereof - it's about the individual's attraction to young kids. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their personal decision, and there are other faiths that allow their leaders to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, perhaps they should consider a different denomination.\n\nI was asked to elaborate on my answer, and I think it boils down to the idea that pedophilia is more about genetics than environmental factors. People are born with their inclinations, and you can't change that through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and covered them up, that's a problem, but I don't think they were aware of everything in all cases. As for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments.",
            "Honestly, at first, I wasn't entirely opposed to the premise, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the September 11th attacks was still a sensitive time, and we kind of got sidetracked into Iraq for reasons that weren't entirely genuine. The Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since been revealed that these claims were false.\n\nTo be frank, this really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems to me that the Bush administration has lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it, even with Colin Powell admitting he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a serious abuse of power and, in my opinion, an impeachable offense.\n\nIt's also disturbing to see the administration disregard the constitution and try to undermine it since 9/11. I think they came into office with the intention of going to war, despite the supposed pretext of WMDs and a connection to 9/11. In fact, it's been suggested that younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and that he wanted to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded motive.\n\nI think the war has dragged on for too long, but withdrawing now would have its own set of problems, as there's a risk that the country would descend into civil war and more people would lose their lives. The alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It's likely to create more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty becomes an increasingly contentious issue. The interim government is already showing signs of disintegration, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control. The presence of radical elements, like Mugtada al-Sadr's party with 20 seats in Parliament, is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I'm struggling to articulate my concerns in a polite manner.",
            "i was supposed to write something about my thoughts on the war in iraq, but it's really hard to form a coherent opinion on the topic. to be honest, i'm not even sure what's going on over there anymore. from what i understand, it started as a kind of get-back reaction because we thought iraq was behind the nine eleven attacks. but now it seems like we're just trying to set up a democracy in iraq, which sounds like a nice idea, but it's a lot harder to achieve than it sounds. \n\ni'm not really an expert on the war, but it seems like we're just causing more problems by being there. i mean, we're using a lot of resources, and it's making everyone upset. if we stay, we'll have to try and create a democracy, which will take a long time, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up. it's a tough spot to be in.\n\ni've been trying to think about this for a while, but it's just really hard to wrap my head around it. i don't even know if i should be calling it a war anymore, since it wasn't even declared by congress. i think that's how it's supposed to work, right? \n\ni guess my opinion is that it's a pointless thing to stay in iraq, but at the same time, i feel bad for all the families whose kids are over there fighting. it's like, i want them to be safe, but at the same time, we're kind of destroying their country and culture. it's hard to say what's the right thing to do. \n\ni feel like the war is going to go on for a long time, and it's just going to get worse and worse. it's already making us look bad, and it's just causing more and more problems. it's hard to know what to think, but i guess that's my two cents on the matter.\n\ni think the whole thing would be a lot simpler if we just declared it a war and got it over with, but that's not how it works. it's like, we're trying to turn iraq into a second u.s., but that's not going to work. it's just going to make things worse, and it's going to fuel the al-qaeda thing even more. i don't know, it's just a mess.\n\nanyway, that's my attempt at forming an opinion on the war in iraq. i'm not exactly sure what to think, but i hope that's a start.",
            "To be honest, I have strong reservations about the government declaring something as legal or not. I believe it's more the domain of churches to decide these matters, given the separation of church and state as outlined in the constitution. This principle is crystal clear, and any attempt to impose power over it would essentially defy the constitution's written words. \n\nIn my opinion, those trying to make it illegal are essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. The fact that most Catholics and Christians don't support it, except in a few areas, speaks volumes. It doesn't seem right for the government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Proposing an amendment to address this issue seems counterintuitive, as it would contradict the constitution's existing provisions. Furthermore, it would likely be the only amendment restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs, which raises the concern that he's favoring one religion over others. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not the government or its officials. There's little justification for the amendment beyond personal views, and I fail to see how it would positively impact the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive effect on society, so I don't think there's a valid reason to pursue it.\n\nI've expressed my main points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "Okay, I was thinking about the war in Iraq, and I believe the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for invading the country before going in. It seemed like there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which wasn't entirely accurate. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the invasion, and it began in 2003.\n\nTo start, I'm not a fan of war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq has a lot of parallels with the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes and not repeated them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is tragic and unacceptable.\n\nWhen the US invaded Iraq, they removed the country's government without being prepared for the aftermath or the power vacuum that would follow. It's like trying to impose a democratic government without considering the potential consequences. They were trying to do the same thing in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and establishing democracy.\n\nHowever, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process. It's not something that can be achieved easily, especially when you're fighting an insurgency rather than a conventional army. You're fighting ordinary citizens who are resisting the occupation, making it extremely difficult to put them down.\n\nI think the government rushed into war without being adequately prepared for the outcome, and that's been a major issue. If we're going to go to war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government failed to do this, and we're still dealing with the consequences. Many American troops are still in Iraq, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to take control of their country.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government tried to deceive the American people by making it seem like the invasion would be a quick and successful operation. However, it's not that simple. Implementing a new form of government takes time, and it's not something that can be achieved overnight. We're naive to think it would be easy, especially when we consider our own country's history with democracy.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated issue, and there's no easy solution. If I had to vote in the 2004 presidential election, one of my reservations about voting for George Bush was that he would finish what he started. However, it's hard to abandon a country after being involved for so long, especially when we've taken away their government and way of life.\n\nOn the other hand, it's impossible to ignore the number of American casualties and the risk of further losses. We need to consider the cost of continuing the war and whether it's worth it for the sake of a free democratic Iraq. If we're making the case that Iraq needs democracy, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the real reason is the oil issue and controlling resources. The US government's decisions are often driven by self-interest and a desire for power.\n\nIn conclusion, I just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that peace is restored. However, I'm not optimistic about the situation, and it's likely that it will take a long time to resolve.",
            "Well, let me get this straight - I'm all for gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal choice, and I think it's ridiculous that people are still debating this. With all the evidence that shows it's not just a social construct, but something that could be biological, it's inhumane to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI'm not sure why the government and politicians are even involved in this. It's a personal issue, not a state or national concern. I mean, take my neighborhood for instance - there are at least two openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and what's the difference? I think it's absurd that President Bush is trying to dictate what marriage means and imposing his own interpretation on the rest of us.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's a growing body of evidence that suggests there's a chemical component to being gay, something that's not just a product of upbringing or environment. It's not like being gay is a choice, it's a natural part of who people are. So, I just don't get why it's such a big deal.\n\nIt's not like straight couples need to jump through hoops to get married. If a guy and a girl want to get hitched, they can just elope in Vegas and nobody bats an eye, but if two gay people want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's splashed all over the national news.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Well, I'm here to give you a reality check - when you post something online, it's essentially public domain. You can't expect your personal opinions or actions to remain private. As someone who's dealt with this firsthand as a resident advisor, I can attest to the fact that anything you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. This can be particularly problematic when you're discussing sensitive or serious topics like violence or shootings. Someone, somewhere, will inevitably stumble upon it and react.\n\nThe internet is a vast, open space that's accessible to everyone, including your friends and acquaintances on social media platforms. Whether it's a bulletin on Myspace or a post on Facebook, it's not just a school or institution that's exposed to it - it's the entire online community. If something serious enough is posted, it can put people on high alert, and as you can imagine, schools and institutions can't just ignore these warnings.\n\nIt's a delicate line to walk because, on the one hand, some people might be joking or engaging in a social experiment, while others might be genuinely expressing their thoughts or concerns. Take the recent incident at our school, for example, where someone overheard a comment and reported it, leading to a deeper investigation. It turned out that a student had posted some concerning content on their social media profiles that they never intended to be taken seriously, but in hindsight, it became a serious issue.\n\nWhen you post something online, you should be aware that there's no such thing as true online privacy. If you don't want your thoughts or actions to be public knowledge, it's best not to post them in the first place. You can't control how people interpret your online presence, but you can control what you put out there. School officials, for instance, shouldn't be friending their students on social media or snooping through their profiles - that's just not their place.\n\nHowever, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a different story if they're monitoring private communications like phone conversations or texts without consent. But if it's something that's publicly available, they can't just ignore it.\n\nAs a residential advisor, I wouldn't even think of friending my residents on social media, not because I'm concerned about their online activities, but because I don't want to be privy to that information. That's not my place, and I'd rather not have to deal with the potential consequences. So, to sum it up, be mindful of what you post online because it can have real-world implications.",
            "I'm starting to feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the idea seemed to be a good one – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original goal. Instead, it feels like we're fighting for the sake of being a global superpower, just to prove a point. I'm also concerned that the real motives behind the war were questionable from the start, considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, as long as there weren't any personal agendas involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective in the first few months, and that was a significant statement in itself.\n\nThe fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, or even several years, is just too much. I believe our purpose has been slowly eroded over time, and it's now more about being at war for the sake of being at war. We're not looking for a decisive end or a victory; we just don't want to lose face.\n\nI think it's time for us to call it quits. The Iraqi government will eventually have to take care of itself, and our continued involvement is just draining our economy. We're spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose, while we have our own problems to address, such as poverty and internal issues like public roads, schools, and healthcare. It seems like a waste of resources to be spending that money on a war that's not achieving its original goal.\n\nIt's astounding to think that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not in our long-term budget. We have our own problems to solve at home, and it's time for us to focus on those. Our citizens are dying in a foreign country, and it's just not worth it.",
            "I wanted to clarify a point, but I'm not sure if I should even bring it up. Apparently, someone online discovered that there was a reason certain information was being kept from the public. Okay, so here's my question: if you post stuff on the internet, like on Myspace, for instance, you have to accept that a lot of people are going to see it. I mean, if you want to be friends with someone on Myspace, you basically give them permission to view your profile, right? So, anytime you put info on the internet, you have to understand that it's out there for anyone to see.\n\nIt's a bit of a tough situation because, on one hand, you can't have someone sitting around all day monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening, but on the other hand, it's like, what if they're just looking for evidence of someone doing something wrong? It's not clear-cut. I mean, I don't think it's right to have someone's job just to snoop through people's profiles, but I guess it depends on the circumstances.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's a bit unsettling to think that there are people out there who can see things about me just by looking at my profile. I saw this thing on TV once where this guy was showing how easy it is to get information about someone online. He went onto this girl's Myspace profile and got her screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. It's pretty scary.\n\nIt's hard to balance the fact that you want to be able to communicate with your friends online, but at the same time, you don't want to put too much information out there that could be used against you. I've noticed that some of my classmates can IM me without even knowing my screen name, which is a bit unnerving. They know a lot about me from my profile, including my class schedule and what my friends are like. I've tried to limit what I put up, but it's a tricky balance to strike.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she said that in her high school, students were banned from having Myspace accounts. I'm not sure how the school had the right to do that, and it seemed a bit unfair. I'm not sure if that's a real privacy issue, but it did strike me as strange.",
            "I struggled with whether to bring up the Iraq War topic, but I guess I have to eventually. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's not really a crucial issue anymore, as everyone except the Bush administration seems to agree that it was a bad idea. Looking at the recent polls, it's clear that the majority of the world population thinks so, with around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops in Iraq all sharing this sentiment. It's hard to argue with the fact that the conflict has been a disaster since before our involvement, and now it's a challenge to find a solution that won't make things worse.\n\nI believe the underlying issue is the deep cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern states, which makes it difficult for our administration to understand the local perspective. It's naive to think we can impose democracy on an area where it's not naturally embraced. While Saddam was a bad guy, we should have carefully weighed the pros and cons before invading. The situation has turned into a quagmire, and I don't see a reason for us to stay any longer. I'm not convinced by the administration's arguments about the potential problems that might arise from our withdrawal, and I'd love to hear a legitimate reason to stay.\n\nIf the administration plans to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I just can't see the justification for prolonging our presence. It's even more ironic that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're essentially telling us to leave. I think they might know better than us, and at least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the enemy in the Middle East.",
            "you know, i think gender discrimination is still an issue in the US.  it's not just a women's problem, though - it's more complex than that.  i believe it's often tied to the specific industry or work environment, and how long it's traditionally been male-dominated.  for instance, in business, women face a 'glass ceiling' where they might have all the qualifications for a job, but are overlooked for promotions due to ingrained societal attitudes. \n\nthe same can be said for men in certain industries, like fashion, where being a stay-at-home parent is often viewed as unusual and not masculine.  it's a common stereotype that men should be the breadwinners, and people look down on them if they choose to take on more domestic responsibilities.  this can be tough for men who want to be involved in childcare and support their families, but are judged for their choices. \n\nin fashion, there's also the issue of men being taken seriously if they're interested in it as a career.  people often doubt their credibility because of societal expectations around masculinity and style.  it's like, how can you truly understand fashion if you're a guy?  the same goes for men who don't fit the typical mold of masculinity.\n\nsocietal attitudes and mindsets are hard to change, and it's a slow process.  we've made progress, but it's still a work in progress.  women are breaking into leadership positions and being accepted in the business world, and more men are choosing to be stay-at-home dads.  as we continue to push for change, it's essential to promote the qualities and strengths of those who are often stereotyped or overlooked.  we need to do this in a way that's not pushy or aggressive, but rather by showcasing their abilities and potential. \n\nit's all about finding a balance and promoting acceptance, rather than forcing it.  we're at a good point where it's starting to become more mainstream, but change takes time.  i'm not sure what more we can do, as it seems like we're already seeing progress.  it's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and with varying levels of education can face discrimination, not just based on gender but also on other factors like socioeconomic status, education level, or geographical location.",
            "It seems that many people misunderstand the recent changes to the law regarding this substance.  To clarify, it was decriminalized, not fully legalized. In other words, it's no longer a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, akin to a traffic ticket. You might get cited and fined without facing the full penalties of arrest and prosecution.\n\nOne issue people often worry about when it comes to decriminalization is the potential long-term consequences, such as difficulties in job interviews and other professional situations. These repercussions can still linger even after decriminalization. However, some argue that the costs associated with arresting and processing individuals, including courtroom appearances and public defender fees, can be substantial.\n\nFrom a budgetary perspective, many municipalities struggle to justify the expense of enforcing this law. Even if it would lead to significant cost savings, some communities may not be willing to make this change, especially if they're strongly opposed to the substance.\n\nOn the other hand, places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, might find it reasonable to decriminalize it. As a result, they could potentially redirect funds to more pressing needs, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and services for the homeless.\n\nIt's essential to consider the financial implications, as well as other factors, when discussing this topic. While marijuana shouldn't be allowed to be ubiquitous, the financial element does play a role in the decision-making process. Some people might be concerned that if it were fully legalized, it could lead to widespread use and potentially problematic behaviors, like driving under the influence. However, it's also true that many people view marijuana as taboo, and making it widely available might be awkward for some.\n\nIn general, both marijuana and alcohol have their negative effects, but they can impact people differently. Some might be more susceptible to the lifestyle consequences of marijuana use, while others may be more affected by its impact on motor skills. Ultimately, everyone's reaction to substances is unique, and it's difficult to make broad generalizations.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree [REWRITE]However, [REWRITE]There are many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church that have remained consistent over time, and [REWRITE]it's great to see these enduring practices [REWRITE]But at the same time, it's essential to be open to change [REWRITE]Many Catholics adhere to the idea of attending church every week, and [REWRITE]they're quite particular about how things are done [REWRITE]Sometimes, though, I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine [REWRITE]Furthermore, they don't accept individuals who aren't flawless Catholics or those from other faiths [REWRITE]For example, my parents' interfaith marriage was not recognized in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background [REWRITE]This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, given the Catholic emphasis on loving others [REWRITE]It's like they're preaching one thing but not practicing it [REWRITE]The disconnect between doctrine and practice is a significant issue, especially when it's rooted in outdated ideas [REWRITE]Despite this, they continue to stick with these outdated practices [REWRITE]Personally, I think it would be beneficial to allow priests to marry [REWRITE]However, I'm not convinced that this would prevent pedophilic behavior [REWRITE]Those who engage in such acts likely wouldn't be deterred by marriage [REWRITE]It's a different dynamic altogether, and [REWRITE]I don't think allowing priests to be married would necessarily make a difference [REWRITE]In other words, child abuse is a separate issue that wouldn't be resolved by allowing priests to marry [REWRITE]It's a complex problem that requires a more comprehensive approach [REWRITE]",
            "so i haven't made up my mind on this yet, but it's a pretty tricky topic. the lines between separation of church and state are getting blurred, and defining marriage has become a really touchy issue. on one hand, you have civil unions, which i think are a good alternative, but on the other hand, you have this whole idea of marriage as a sacrament that's deeply rooted in faith. if that's the case, people don't get tax breaks or any special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. so i'm inclined to think that marriage should be viewed as a civil union, a union between two people, without any government interference in what that union is or isn't.\n\nthe thing is, the fact that gay marriage is even a debate is a bit of a non-starter. if two people want to get married, or enter into a civil union, it's really no one's business but theirs. and if the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should make it federal law. but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? that just seems like overkill. it's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution.\n\nit's not like it's some huge, earth-shattering cause that's worth amending the constitution over. it's just not that important. and to be honest, it's pretty ridiculous to try to define marriage in the constitution in the first place. i'm not even sure what to say to that.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to a somewhat mixed perspective on homosexuality for me. On one hand, I have many close gay friends, so it's hard for me to take a one-dimensional stance on the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't believe it's a matter for the federal government to decide; rather, each state should have the autonomy to make its own decision.\n\nConsidering the diversity of our country, with some states being more liberal and others more conservative, it's likely that each state will have its own stance on gay marriage. If you live in a state that has already legalized it, I don't think you should disagree with the decision, as you have chosen to reside there and should respect the local laws. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, and therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left up to individual states.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but to reiterate, I don't think the president should be able to impose their will on the entire country in regards to this issue. President Bush's ban on gay marriage doesn't sit well with me, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't dictate how each one runs itself. It would be more productive to let the states decide for themselves. Plus, with the president's term coming to an end soon, the issue will likely be revisited, and it's better to let each state make its own decision rather than having it change every time the presidency switches hands. It's the states that will have to live with the consequences of this decision, not the president.",
            "Honestly, I'm finding it difficult to articulate my thoughts on this issue. Let me break it down for you. MySpace, like the internet in general, is a public platform where you post content for others to see. If you put something online, you have to accept that people will view it, including school officials. Even if you post under a pseudonym, they could still access it from their homes. In a situation where it might prevent a school shooting, I believe they have every right to do so. Their primary responsibility is to ensure student safety.\n\nIn fact, if school officials monitor Myspace to identify students engaging in prohibited activities, I think that's perfectly fine. It's their job to maintain a safe environment, and if that means keeping an eye on students' online behavior, so be it. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and invading students' privacy. However, if the monitoring leads to a safer school environment, I don't consider it an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but I'll try to summarize. Posting on Myspace is like sharing information with the public. If you're worried about getting in trouble for something you post, it's not unreasonable. Once something is online, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. This is something I'm cautious about, even in emails.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, and if that means monitoring Myspace or other online platforms, I'm okay with it. In fact, I've discussed this with a teacher of mine, and they feel the same way. They have to be prepared for potential threats, like lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. In a way, this incident was similar, as they were trying to prevent something like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn short, I think school officials were justified in monitoring Myspace to ensure student safety. They were simply doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. That's all I wanted to say on the matter.",
            "I guess I've been a bit quiet lately because I'm still trying to process my thoughts on the war. To be honest, my initial reaction after 9/11 was to support it. I was personally affected, and I felt like we needed to take action and show them that their actions wouldn't be tolerated. I think we went in there with a lot of emotions and anger, which clouded our judgment. We didn't really think about the long-term consequences or have a clear plan, which ultimately led to things not going as smoothly as we had hoped.\n\nI've since changed my mind and I'm now firmly against the war. I don't think it's done anything to help the situation, and in fact, I think it's made things worse. The people over there are fighting amongst themselves, so us being there isn't really accomplishing anything. It's like they're more focused on fighting each other than working towards a common goal, and I just don't see how us being there is making a difference.\n\nTo be blunt, I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel like we're just throwing our money and lives away for no reason. I've come to realize that war is a completely different beast when you're not the one waging it. The people over there have a completely different mindset, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, but rather get rid of us.\n\nLooking back, I think we went in there on a mission of revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. I think President Bush was swept up in the emotional response to 9/11 and declared war on Iraq without a clear plan in place. At the time, I understood where he was coming from, but now I think we should have taken a more measured approach.\n\nI don't think we could have just let things go after 9/11, but I do think we could have done a better job of planning and executing our strategy. There was a lack of unity and clear direction, and that's something that would have made a big difference. As it stands, I think we're just making things worse and hurting ourselves more than anyone else.\n\nWe're not the ones to change the people over there; they're going to be who they are, and we're not going to be able to fix that. I think we're just delaying the inevitable by staying there, and it's time for us to leave. We're not making enough progress, and once we do leave, things will likely collapse. I think we're just wasting our time and resources by staying, and it's time to cut our losses."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "i think the catholic church really needs to reevaluate its stance on certain issues. they're experiencing a decline in followers, and i believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. for instance, their rigid views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite outdated and may be driving people away. if they adapted to a more modern perspective, they might not lose their followers. many people are turning against the church due to its traditional views on these matters. those who disagree with the church on these subjects may not feel comfortable being part of a community where such views are strongly emphasized. this could lead to people leaving the church because they feel they're going against its teachings. i don't see why the church can't reconsider its stance on issues like female priests or priests being able to get married. it's possible that if they allowed priests to have personal relationships, it might not have changed the outcome, but it's worth exploring. however, the church's stance on these topics seems archaic, and it's hard to understand why they can't find a middle ground. they claim that priests are married to god and devoted to their faith, but they're essentially denying them a normal life with a family and loved ones, just like everyone else.",
            "Honestly, I'll be the first to admit that I haven't fully given much thought to the issue of gay marriage. However, I'm not opposed to the idea in principle. I think people, regardless of their sexual orientation, shouldn't be held accountable for who they are. It's not like being gay is a choice that someone makes consciously. I believe people are born with their orientation, and it's not something they should be penalized for. To deny gay couples the right to marriage while allowing opposite-sex couples to do so just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nOn a deeper level, the idea that people's sexual orientation is not a choice seems obvious. Think about it - I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not as if they have control over it. This lack of control means they shouldn't be held responsible for who they are.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government shouldn't be involved in issues like this. It's not a matter of law or morality; it's simply about giving people the freedom to be who they are. I don't think it's fair to put people on a pedestal and imply they made a wrong decision or choice. Gay people aren't doing anything wrong; they're just existing and being themselves.\n\nFrankly, I think the federal government is out of place here. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's simply a matter of people's personal lives. They shouldn't be intervened in or judged based on their orientation. It's who they are, and that's not something they should be punished for.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "I'm in favor of legalizing gay marriage because there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but that's not true. It's like saying heads will never be tails - they're two sides of the same coin. While people may have different views on the matter, there are many civil rights at stake, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a gay couple is together, their partner shouldn't be denied the right to be with them in the hospital or visit them when they're sick.\n\nThe fact is, scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship, such as communication, trust, and commitment. It's not about getting married in a church; it's about obtaining a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, it's hard to argue against granting marriage to gay couples. It's essentially segregation, separate but unequal. People worry about adoption issues and community concerns, but these concerns are unfounded. Gay couples can be just as good parents as heterosexual couples, and their children will face the same challenges in school and society.\n\nIn fact, some cities, like New York, have already implemented programs to support children of gay parents, such as special schools to protect them from bullying and harassment. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about the quality of care and parenting skills.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is hypocritical, considering the government's stance on other issues, such as stem cell research and the Pledge of Allegiance. It's unacceptable to enforce religious standards on an entire country while ignoring the moral and cultural diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to institutions that conduct research and studies, rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Well, I've got a bit of a soapbox moment here, so bear with me. As a pharmacy intern in a hospital over the summer, I've had some time to think about the whole issue of illegal substances. Now, just because something's on the list of forbidden substances doesn't mean it's inherently bad. Take it for what it's worth, I think it's fair to say that some illegal drugs have real benefits.\n\nIn fact, pharmacies like the one I'm working at use controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets all the time because they're proven to help people. And let's be real, if we're going to dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana because of its illegality, that's just a cop-out. We should be able to explore its medicinal uses without fear of judgment.\n\nI'm not saying it's identical to alcohol, which can be abused and lead to all sorts of problems. But if we're honest, marijuana isn't exactly the same. If we could create a more nuanced view of marijuana, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, maybe people would use it more responsibly. After all, it's not like it's heroin or cocaine – it's not that toxic.\n\nMy point is, getting rid of the negative stigma surrounding marijuana might be the first step towards using it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes. If we could move past the 'terrifying illicit substance' image, people might be more likely to use it in a way that's not detrimental to their health.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has made some adjustments to fit into the 21st century. It's not as traditional as it used to be. Growing up, I used to go to church every Sunday, and it was a big deal - I'd get dressed up in matching outfits, including a cute little dress, shoes, and a purse. It was a big part of my private school experience, where I'd see all my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, I've noticed some changes. They've introduced a shorter, 30-minute mass for teenagers, and it's become more casual. People often dress down, especially in the summer, and even families who run late still show up. It's become a more relaxed atmosphere, even during morning masses where people used to dress up. I've noticed that people now wear jeans and khakis, which is still nice, but it's a more casual vibe overall.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the shift in the church's atmosphere. I'm not familiar with the church's politics, but that's my observation. As for the recent scandals involving Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not about the marriage or lack thereof - it's about the individual's attraction to young kids. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their personal decision, and there are other faiths that allow their leaders to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, perhaps they should consider a different denomination.\n\nI was asked to elaborate on my answer, and I think it boils down to the idea that pedophilia is more about genetics than environmental factors. People are born with their inclinations, and you can't change that through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and covered them up, that's a problem, but I don't think they were aware of everything in all cases. As for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments.",
            "Honestly, at first, I wasn't entirely opposed to the premise, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the September 11th attacks was still a sensitive time, and we kind of got sidetracked into Iraq for reasons that weren't entirely genuine. The Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since been revealed that these claims were false.\n\nTo be frank, this really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems to me that the Bush administration has lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it, even with Colin Powell admitting he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a serious abuse of power and, in my opinion, an impeachable offense.\n\nIt's also disturbing to see the administration disregard the constitution and try to undermine it since 9/11. I think they came into office with the intention of going to war, despite the supposed pretext of WMDs and a connection to 9/11. In fact, it's been suggested that younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and that he wanted to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded motive.\n\nI think the war has dragged on for too long, but withdrawing now would have its own set of problems, as there's a risk that the country would descend into civil war and more people would lose their lives. The alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It's likely to create more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty becomes an increasingly contentious issue. The interim government is already showing signs of disintegration, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control. The presence of radical elements, like Mugtada al-Sadr's party with 20 seats in Parliament, is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I'm struggling to articulate my concerns in a polite manner.",
            "i was supposed to write something about my thoughts on the war in iraq, but it's really hard to form a coherent opinion on the topic. to be honest, i'm not even sure what's going on over there anymore. from what i understand, it started as a kind of get-back reaction because we thought iraq was behind the nine eleven attacks. but now it seems like we're just trying to set up a democracy in iraq, which sounds like a nice idea, but it's a lot harder to achieve than it sounds. \n\ni'm not really an expert on the war, but it seems like we're just causing more problems by being there. i mean, we're using a lot of resources, and it's making everyone upset. if we stay, we'll have to try and create a democracy, which will take a long time, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up. it's a tough spot to be in.\n\ni've been trying to think about this for a while, but it's just really hard to wrap my head around it. i don't even know if i should be calling it a war anymore, since it wasn't even declared by congress. i think that's how it's supposed to work, right? \n\ni guess my opinion is that it's a pointless thing to stay in iraq, but at the same time, i feel bad for all the families whose kids are over there fighting. it's like, i want them to be safe, but at the same time, we're kind of destroying their country and culture. it's hard to say what's the right thing to do. \n\ni feel like the war is going to go on for a long time, and it's just going to get worse and worse. it's already making us look bad, and it's just causing more and more problems. it's hard to know what to think, but i guess that's my two cents on the matter.\n\ni think the whole thing would be a lot simpler if we just declared it a war and got it over with, but that's not how it works. it's like, we're trying to turn iraq into a second u.s., but that's not going to work. it's just going to make things worse, and it's going to fuel the al-qaeda thing even more. i don't know, it's just a mess.\n\nanyway, that's my attempt at forming an opinion on the war in iraq. i'm not exactly sure what to think, but i hope that's a start.",
            "To be honest, I have strong reservations about the government declaring something as legal or not. I believe it's more the domain of churches to decide these matters, given the separation of church and state as outlined in the constitution. This principle is crystal clear, and any attempt to impose power over it would essentially defy the constitution's written words. \n\nIn my opinion, those trying to make it illegal are essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. The fact that most Catholics and Christians don't support it, except in a few areas, speaks volumes. It doesn't seem right for the government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Proposing an amendment to address this issue seems counterintuitive, as it would contradict the constitution's existing provisions. Furthermore, it would likely be the only amendment restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs, which raises the concern that he's favoring one religion over others. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not the government or its officials. There's little justification for the amendment beyond personal views, and I fail to see how it would positively impact the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive effect on society, so I don't think there's a valid reason to pursue it.\n\nI've expressed my main points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "Okay, I was thinking about the war in Iraq, and I believe the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for invading the country before going in. It seemed like there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which wasn't entirely accurate. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the invasion, and it began in 2003.\n\nTo start, I'm not a fan of war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq has a lot of parallels with the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes and not repeated them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is tragic and unacceptable.\n\nWhen the US invaded Iraq, they removed the country's government without being prepared for the aftermath or the power vacuum that would follow. It's like trying to impose a democratic government without considering the potential consequences. They were trying to do the same thing in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and establishing democracy.\n\nHowever, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process. It's not something that can be achieved easily, especially when you're fighting an insurgency rather than a conventional army. You're fighting ordinary citizens who are resisting the occupation, making it extremely difficult to put them down.\n\nI think the government rushed into war without being adequately prepared for the outcome, and that's been a major issue. If we're going to go to war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government failed to do this, and we're still dealing with the consequences. Many American troops are still in Iraq, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to take control of their country.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government tried to deceive the American people by making it seem like the invasion would be a quick and successful operation. However, it's not that simple. Implementing a new form of government takes time, and it's not something that can be achieved overnight. We're naive to think it would be easy, especially when we consider our own country's history with democracy.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated issue, and there's no easy solution. If I had to vote in the 2004 presidential election, one of my reservations about voting for George Bush was that he would finish what he started. However, it's hard to abandon a country after being involved for so long, especially when we've taken away their government and way of life.\n\nOn the other hand, it's impossible to ignore the number of American casualties and the risk of further losses. We need to consider the cost of continuing the war and whether it's worth it for the sake of a free democratic Iraq. If we're making the case that Iraq needs democracy, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the real reason is the oil issue and controlling resources. The US government's decisions are often driven by self-interest and a desire for power.\n\nIn conclusion, I just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that peace is restored. However, I'm not optimistic about the situation, and it's likely that it will take a long time to resolve.",
            "Well, let me get this straight - I'm all for gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal choice, and I think it's ridiculous that people are still debating this. With all the evidence that shows it's not just a social construct, but something that could be biological, it's inhumane to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI'm not sure why the government and politicians are even involved in this. It's a personal issue, not a state or national concern. I mean, take my neighborhood for instance - there are at least two openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and what's the difference? I think it's absurd that President Bush is trying to dictate what marriage means and imposing his own interpretation on the rest of us.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's a growing body of evidence that suggests there's a chemical component to being gay, something that's not just a product of upbringing or environment. It's not like being gay is a choice, it's a natural part of who people are. So, I just don't get why it's such a big deal.\n\nIt's not like straight couples need to jump through hoops to get married. If a guy and a girl want to get hitched, they can just elope in Vegas and nobody bats an eye, but if two gay people want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's splashed all over the national news.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Well, I'm here to give you a reality check - when you post something online, it's essentially public domain. You can't expect your personal opinions or actions to remain private. As someone who's dealt with this firsthand as a resident advisor, I can attest to the fact that anything you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. This can be particularly problematic when you're discussing sensitive or serious topics like violence or shootings. Someone, somewhere, will inevitably stumble upon it and react.\n\nThe internet is a vast, open space that's accessible to everyone, including your friends and acquaintances on social media platforms. Whether it's a bulletin on Myspace or a post on Facebook, it's not just a school or institution that's exposed to it - it's the entire online community. If something serious enough is posted, it can put people on high alert, and as you can imagine, schools and institutions can't just ignore these warnings.\n\nIt's a delicate line to walk because, on the one hand, some people might be joking or engaging in a social experiment, while others might be genuinely expressing their thoughts or concerns. Take the recent incident at our school, for example, where someone overheard a comment and reported it, leading to a deeper investigation. It turned out that a student had posted some concerning content on their social media profiles that they never intended to be taken seriously, but in hindsight, it became a serious issue.\n\nWhen you post something online, you should be aware that there's no such thing as true online privacy. If you don't want your thoughts or actions to be public knowledge, it's best not to post them in the first place. You can't control how people interpret your online presence, but you can control what you put out there. School officials, for instance, shouldn't be friending their students on social media or snooping through their profiles - that's just not their place.\n\nHowever, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a different story if they're monitoring private communications like phone conversations or texts without consent. But if it's something that's publicly available, they can't just ignore it.\n\nAs a residential advisor, I wouldn't even think of friending my residents on social media, not because I'm concerned about their online activities, but because I don't want to be privy to that information. That's not my place, and I'd rather not have to deal with the potential consequences. So, to sum it up, be mindful of what you post online because it can have real-world implications.",
            "I'm starting to feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the idea seemed to be a good one – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original goal. Instead, it feels like we're fighting for the sake of being a global superpower, just to prove a point. I'm also concerned that the real motives behind the war were questionable from the start, considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, as long as there weren't any personal agendas involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective in the first few months, and that was a significant statement in itself.\n\nThe fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, or even several years, is just too much. I believe our purpose has been slowly eroded over time, and it's now more about being at war for the sake of being at war. We're not looking for a decisive end or a victory; we just don't want to lose face.\n\nI think it's time for us to call it quits. The Iraqi government will eventually have to take care of itself, and our continued involvement is just draining our economy. We're spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose, while we have our own problems to address, such as poverty and internal issues like public roads, schools, and healthcare. It seems like a waste of resources to be spending that money on a war that's not achieving its original goal.\n\nIt's astounding to think that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not in our long-term budget. We have our own problems to solve at home, and it's time for us to focus on those. Our citizens are dying in a foreign country, and it's just not worth it.",
            "I wanted to clarify a point, but I'm not sure if I should even bring it up. Apparently, someone online discovered that there was a reason certain information was being kept from the public. Okay, so here's my question: if you post stuff on the internet, like on Myspace, for instance, you have to accept that a lot of people are going to see it. I mean, if you want to be friends with someone on Myspace, you basically give them permission to view your profile, right? So, anytime you put info on the internet, you have to understand that it's out there for anyone to see.\n\nIt's a bit of a tough situation because, on one hand, you can't have someone sitting around all day monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening, but on the other hand, it's like, what if they're just looking for evidence of someone doing something wrong? It's not clear-cut. I mean, I don't think it's right to have someone's job just to snoop through people's profiles, but I guess it depends on the circumstances.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's a bit unsettling to think that there are people out there who can see things about me just by looking at my profile. I saw this thing on TV once where this guy was showing how easy it is to get information about someone online. He went onto this girl's Myspace profile and got her screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. It's pretty scary.\n\nIt's hard to balance the fact that you want to be able to communicate with your friends online, but at the same time, you don't want to put too much information out there that could be used against you. I've noticed that some of my classmates can IM me without even knowing my screen name, which is a bit unnerving. They know a lot about me from my profile, including my class schedule and what my friends are like. I've tried to limit what I put up, but it's a tricky balance to strike.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she said that in her high school, students were banned from having Myspace accounts. I'm not sure how the school had the right to do that, and it seemed a bit unfair. I'm not sure if that's a real privacy issue, but it did strike me as strange.",
            "I struggled with whether to bring up the Iraq War topic, but I guess I have to eventually. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's not really a crucial issue anymore, as everyone except the Bush administration seems to agree that it was a bad idea. Looking at the recent polls, it's clear that the majority of the world population thinks so, with around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops in Iraq all sharing this sentiment. It's hard to argue with the fact that the conflict has been a disaster since before our involvement, and now it's a challenge to find a solution that won't make things worse.\n\nI believe the underlying issue is the deep cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern states, which makes it difficult for our administration to understand the local perspective. It's naive to think we can impose democracy on an area where it's not naturally embraced. While Saddam was a bad guy, we should have carefully weighed the pros and cons before invading. The situation has turned into a quagmire, and I don't see a reason for us to stay any longer. I'm not convinced by the administration's arguments about the potential problems that might arise from our withdrawal, and I'd love to hear a legitimate reason to stay.\n\nIf the administration plans to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I just can't see the justification for prolonging our presence. It's even more ironic that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're essentially telling us to leave. I think they might know better than us, and at least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the enemy in the Middle East.",
            "you know, i think gender discrimination is still an issue in the US.  it's not just a women's problem, though - it's more complex than that.  i believe it's often tied to the specific industry or work environment, and how long it's traditionally been male-dominated.  for instance, in business, women face a 'glass ceiling' where they might have all the qualifications for a job, but are overlooked for promotions due to ingrained societal attitudes. \n\nthe same can be said for men in certain industries, like fashion, where being a stay-at-home parent is often viewed as unusual and not masculine.  it's a common stereotype that men should be the breadwinners, and people look down on them if they choose to take on more domestic responsibilities.  this can be tough for men who want to be involved in childcare and support their families, but are judged for their choices. \n\nin fashion, there's also the issue of men being taken seriously if they're interested in it as a career.  people often doubt their credibility because of societal expectations around masculinity and style.  it's like, how can you truly understand fashion if you're a guy?  the same goes for men who don't fit the typical mold of masculinity.\n\nsocietal attitudes and mindsets are hard to change, and it's a slow process.  we've made progress, but it's still a work in progress.  women are breaking into leadership positions and being accepted in the business world, and more men are choosing to be stay-at-home dads.  as we continue to push for change, it's essential to promote the qualities and strengths of those who are often stereotyped or overlooked.  we need to do this in a way that's not pushy or aggressive, but rather by showcasing their abilities and potential. \n\nit's all about finding a balance and promoting acceptance, rather than forcing it.  we're at a good point where it's starting to become more mainstream, but change takes time.  i'm not sure what more we can do, as it seems like we're already seeing progress.  it's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and with varying levels of education can face discrimination, not just based on gender but also on other factors like socioeconomic status, education level, or geographical location.",
            "It seems that many people misunderstand the recent changes to the law regarding this substance.  To clarify, it was decriminalized, not fully legalized. In other words, it's no longer a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, akin to a traffic ticket. You might get cited and fined without facing the full penalties of arrest and prosecution.\n\nOne issue people often worry about when it comes to decriminalization is the potential long-term consequences, such as difficulties in job interviews and other professional situations. These repercussions can still linger even after decriminalization. However, some argue that the costs associated with arresting and processing individuals, including courtroom appearances and public defender fees, can be substantial.\n\nFrom a budgetary perspective, many municipalities struggle to justify the expense of enforcing this law. Even if it would lead to significant cost savings, some communities may not be willing to make this change, especially if they're strongly opposed to the substance.\n\nOn the other hand, places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, might find it reasonable to decriminalize it. As a result, they could potentially redirect funds to more pressing needs, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and services for the homeless.\n\nIt's essential to consider the financial implications, as well as other factors, when discussing this topic. While marijuana shouldn't be allowed to be ubiquitous, the financial element does play a role in the decision-making process. Some people might be concerned that if it were fully legalized, it could lead to widespread use and potentially problematic behaviors, like driving under the influence. However, it's also true that many people view marijuana as taboo, and making it widely available might be awkward for some.\n\nIn general, both marijuana and alcohol have their negative effects, but they can impact people differently. Some might be more susceptible to the lifestyle consequences of marijuana use, while others may be more affected by its impact on motor skills. Ultimately, everyone's reaction to substances is unique, and it's difficult to make broad generalizations.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree [REWRITE]However, [REWRITE]There are many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church that have remained consistent over time, and [REWRITE]it's great to see these enduring practices [REWRITE]But at the same time, it's essential to be open to change [REWRITE]Many Catholics adhere to the idea of attending church every week, and [REWRITE]they're quite particular about how things are done [REWRITE]Sometimes, though, I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine [REWRITE]Furthermore, they don't accept individuals who aren't flawless Catholics or those from other faiths [REWRITE]For example, my parents' interfaith marriage was not recognized in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background [REWRITE]This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, given the Catholic emphasis on loving others [REWRITE]It's like they're preaching one thing but not practicing it [REWRITE]The disconnect between doctrine and practice is a significant issue, especially when it's rooted in outdated ideas [REWRITE]Despite this, they continue to stick with these outdated practices [REWRITE]Personally, I think it would be beneficial to allow priests to marry [REWRITE]However, I'm not convinced that this would prevent pedophilic behavior [REWRITE]Those who engage in such acts likely wouldn't be deterred by marriage [REWRITE]It's a different dynamic altogether, and [REWRITE]I don't think allowing priests to be married would necessarily make a difference [REWRITE]In other words, child abuse is a separate issue that wouldn't be resolved by allowing priests to marry [REWRITE]It's a complex problem that requires a more comprehensive approach [REWRITE]",
            "so i haven't made up my mind on this yet, but it's a pretty tricky topic. the lines between separation of church and state are getting blurred, and defining marriage has become a really touchy issue. on one hand, you have civil unions, which i think are a good alternative, but on the other hand, you have this whole idea of marriage as a sacrament that's deeply rooted in faith. if that's the case, people don't get tax breaks or any special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. so i'm inclined to think that marriage should be viewed as a civil union, a union between two people, without any government interference in what that union is or isn't.\n\nthe thing is, the fact that gay marriage is even a debate is a bit of a non-starter. if two people want to get married, or enter into a civil union, it's really no one's business but theirs. and if the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should make it federal law. but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? that just seems like overkill. it's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution.\n\nit's not like it's some huge, earth-shattering cause that's worth amending the constitution over. it's just not that important. and to be honest, it's pretty ridiculous to try to define marriage in the constitution in the first place. i'm not even sure what to say to that.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to a somewhat mixed perspective on homosexuality for me. On one hand, I have many close gay friends, so it's hard for me to take a one-dimensional stance on the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't believe it's a matter for the federal government to decide; rather, each state should have the autonomy to make its own decision.\n\nConsidering the diversity of our country, with some states being more liberal and others more conservative, it's likely that each state will have its own stance on gay marriage. If you live in a state that has already legalized it, I don't think you should disagree with the decision, as you have chosen to reside there and should respect the local laws. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, and therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left up to individual states.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but to reiterate, I don't think the president should be able to impose their will on the entire country in regards to this issue. President Bush's ban on gay marriage doesn't sit well with me, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't dictate how each one runs itself. It would be more productive to let the states decide for themselves. Plus, with the president's term coming to an end soon, the issue will likely be revisited, and it's better to let each state make its own decision rather than having it change every time the presidency switches hands. It's the states that will have to live with the consequences of this decision, not the president.",
            "Honestly, I'm finding it difficult to articulate my thoughts on this issue. Let me break it down for you. MySpace, like the internet in general, is a public platform where you post content for others to see. If you put something online, you have to accept that people will view it, including school officials. Even if you post under a pseudonym, they could still access it from their homes. In a situation where it might prevent a school shooting, I believe they have every right to do so. Their primary responsibility is to ensure student safety.\n\nIn fact, if school officials monitor Myspace to identify students engaging in prohibited activities, I think that's perfectly fine. It's their job to maintain a safe environment, and if that means keeping an eye on students' online behavior, so be it. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and invading students' privacy. However, if the monitoring leads to a safer school environment, I don't consider it an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but I'll try to summarize. Posting on Myspace is like sharing information with the public. If you're worried about getting in trouble for something you post, it's not unreasonable. Once something is online, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. This is something I'm cautious about, even in emails.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, and if that means monitoring Myspace or other online platforms, I'm okay with it. In fact, I've discussed this with a teacher of mine, and they feel the same way. They have to be prepared for potential threats, like lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. In a way, this incident was similar, as they were trying to prevent something like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn short, I think school officials were justified in monitoring Myspace to ensure student safety. They were simply doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. That's all I wanted to say on the matter.",
            "I guess I've been a bit quiet lately because I'm still trying to process my thoughts on the war. To be honest, my initial reaction after 9/11 was to support it. I was personally affected, and I felt like we needed to take action and show them that their actions wouldn't be tolerated. I think we went in there with a lot of emotions and anger, which clouded our judgment. We didn't really think about the long-term consequences or have a clear plan, which ultimately led to things not going as smoothly as we had hoped.\n\nI've since changed my mind and I'm now firmly against the war. I don't think it's done anything to help the situation, and in fact, I think it's made things worse. The people over there are fighting amongst themselves, so us being there isn't really accomplishing anything. It's like they're more focused on fighting each other than working towards a common goal, and I just don't see how us being there is making a difference.\n\nTo be blunt, I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel like we're just throwing our money and lives away for no reason. I've come to realize that war is a completely different beast when you're not the one waging it. The people over there have a completely different mindset, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, but rather get rid of us.\n\nLooking back, I think we went in there on a mission of revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. I think President Bush was swept up in the emotional response to 9/11 and declared war on Iraq without a clear plan in place. At the time, I understood where he was coming from, but now I think we should have taken a more measured approach.\n\nI don't think we could have just let things go after 9/11, but I do think we could have done a better job of planning and executing our strategy. There was a lack of unity and clear direction, and that's something that would have made a big difference. As it stands, I think we're just making things worse and hurting ourselves more than anyone else.\n\nWe're not the ones to change the people over there; they're going to be who they are, and we're not going to be able to fix that. I think we're just delaying the inevitable by staying there, and it's time for us to leave. We're not making enough progress, and once we do leave, things will likely collapse. I think we're just wasting our time and resources by staying, and it's time to cut our losses."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think there are a few areas where the Catholic Church needs to modernize its views. I believe that the Church's stance on several issues is one of the reasons it's losing followers. They've been saying that they're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things. \n\nFor example, their views on gay marriages, abortions, and birth control are quite strict. While I understand that these are important issues, I think their views are a bit outdated in some ways. If they adapted to a more contemporary way of thinking, I think they'd be less concerned about losing their followers.\n\nHowever, it seems like a lot of people are starting to distance themselves from the Church due to their stance on these issues. They see the Church's views as being out of touch with modern society, which is causing disagreements and divisions. \n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, might make it difficult for people who support it to feel comfortable being part of the Church. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage might not want to be part of a community that views it as wrong. The same goes for other issues like the exclusion of female priests and married priests.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church claims that priests are devoted to God, but everyone else in the world has to balance their job with other aspects of their life, so why should priests be any different? It's not like having a family or other relationships would distract them from their faith.",
            "Honestly, I haven't really had much to say on the topic of gay marriage, but I do have a pretty clear opinion on it. In my view, being gay isn't something that someone chooses, it's just who they are. I don't think people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation, and it's not something that's within their control.\n\nTo me, it seems unfair that people can marry someone of the opposite sex, but not someone of the same sex. It just doesn't seem right to me. I've given it some thought, but to be honest, I haven't put a lot of effort into it because it just seems like a basic issue of equality.\n\nLike, we're all born with our own unique qualities and characteristics - some people are straight, while others are gay. It's not something that people can just decide or choose to be. I think it's unfair to hold gay people to a different standard just because of who they are.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any business getting involved in this issue. It's not a matter of national security, and it's not a moral issue in my opinion. It's just a matter of people being who they are and living their lives. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who people can and can't marry based on their own personal preferences.\n\nIt's hard to put into words, but it just seems like the government is overstepping its bounds when it comes to this issue. They're not addressing any real concerns or threats to society, they're just interfering with people's personal lives. And that's not right.\n\nI think that's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there isn't a valid argument against it. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The fact is that gay couples are vastly different from straight couples, and it's impossible to compare the two. They're like two sides of the same coin - they're fundamentally the same, but with some key differences. It's not like one is inherently better than the other.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is that gay couples are denied certain civil rights, such as the right to make medical decisions for each other or visit each other in the hospital. This is ridiculous, especially since many gay couples are committed to each other for life. Research has shown that homosexual couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples, and they have the same factors that contribute to a healthy relationship.\n\nThe real issue here is that gay couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church wedding. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, including the roles they play in their relationships, and they're just as capable of raising children as straight couples.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Children of gay couples are just as likely to adjust to society as children of straight couples, and they're not more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. The real issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, for example, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nIt's not about the parenting skills of gay couples, but about the societal attitudes towards them. It's not about whether or not children of gay couples will turn out okay, but about whether or not society will accept and support them. The federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal nationwide, and the proposed amendment should be rejected. President Bush's views on the matter are rooted in his own moral beliefs, but morality varies from person to person, and it's not up to the government to impose its own morality on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has stated that these claims are unfounded, and people should listen to research and studies rather than popular opinion or cultural norms. By doing so, we can start to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. People often assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it automatically has no benefits. But, in my opinion, that's not necessarily true. I'd say that for public availability, I'm against it, no question. However, for medical purposes, I believe it's a different story. A drug's illegality doesn't necessarily mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial in some cases, but I think you get my point.\n\nYeah, I mean think about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're prescribed because of their benefits, even though they're restricted. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of the stigma surrounding it, well, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should acknowledge its potential benefits instead.\n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol, since marijuana abuse can have different consequences. Although, like with alcohol, abusing it can lead to problems. It's a complex issue. I'd say we could integrate it into our society gradually, but not all at once, as that could lead to abuse. However, if we could just remove the stigma around marijuana, people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople have this horrible image of marijuana because it's a prohibited substance, but it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could change this perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has already made some changes to adapt to the 21st century. The atmosphere isn't as strict as it was when I was younger. I used to attend church every Sunday and would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just part of the routine, especially since I went to a private school where I'd see my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced a more casual teenage mass that lasts only 30 minutes. People now wear a lot more relaxed clothing, especially during the summer months when some even show up directly from the beach. Even during morning masses, which I used to dress up for, people often wear jeans and khakis, a far cry from the more formal attire of the past. To me, that's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\nAs for other issues, like the allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still develop pedophilic tendencies, and it's not solely because they're allowed or not allowed to get married. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and their attraction to young children isn't something that can be prevented by changing the church's stance on marriage. In fact, some religions already allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh Heaven's reverend or minister, so it's not a matter of whether they're allowed to get married, but rather a personal choice. \n\nI believe that pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that's developed due to upbringing or environment. While there might be some factors that contribute to it, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent these incidents from happening. If they knew about the abuse and were covering it up, then that's a different story, but in many cases, they might not have been aware. \n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any further thoughts to add.",
            "What got me going is that I think the initial premise was somewhat plausible, but the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was still too raw, and I believe it was used as a pretext for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration initially linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which we now know was a false narrative. This really put my hackles up, and the whole Iraq war still boils my blood.\n\nIt's hard to shake the feeling that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American public and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a severe breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the constitution has been evident since 9/11, and it's been a long-term strategy to marginalize it. I believe they had a plan to go to war from the start, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly stemming from his father's administration.\n\nThe alleged plan to expand our energy supply in the region, as revealed by a former Treasury Secretary in his book, adds fuel to the fire. It's an underhanded way to achieve this goal.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, I'm not convinced it's the right time to withdraw, as it could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current alternative, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the solution either, as it could create more problems in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty is at risk, and the interim government is struggling to maintain control.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is ineffective, and even the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. The return of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, is a significant concern. The political process is plagued by infighting and radical factions vying for control, making it a challenging and fractious environment.\n\nI'm at a loss for words to articulate my frustrations in polite company.",
            "I've been trying to think about the War in Iraq, but to be honest, it's a bit of a tough topic for me. I mean, it's not even like it was officially declared as a war, you know? It feels like we just sort of went after Iraq as a way of getting back at them for the 9/11 attacks. So, I haven't really been following it closely, I don't know the details, and I'm not sure what our main goals are anymore. I think we're trying to build democracy over there, but it feels like that's just a way of making Iraq like us, and we're also sort of using it as an excuse to get control of their oil resources. However, I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep sending our troops over there, because it's causing so much tension and hurting innocent people. It's like, if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, but that's going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up. I'm really not sure what to think.\n\nHonestly, I think the whole thing is kind of pointless now. I'm not even sure why we're still calling it a war when it was never officially declared by Congress. I think that's like, a requirement or something. And I'm not sure what our point is anymore. We're using guns to show that we're powerful and American, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep going. I think we should just call it what it is and try to find a way to get out of there without causing more harm.\n\nBut at the same time, I feel bad for the families of our soldiers who are over there, and I don't want them to get hurt. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end when I know that it's affecting so many people's lives. However, I do think that trying to impose our values and culture on Iraq is just going to make things worse for them in the long run. It's a whole different culture over there, and we're just going to end up causing more problems by trying to change them. And I think that's what's going to make the Al-Kaida thing even worse, and they'll just keep hating us more. So, I think this whole thing is just going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Honestly, I have some reservations about the notion that it's right for the government to declare something as legal or illegal, especially when it comes to issues that are largely under the purview of churches. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone principle in the US constitution, and I believe that trying to impose a particular stance on this issue would be a clear disregard for that fundamental principle.\n\nIn my view, attempting to legislate or enforce powers over these matters would be akin to defying the constitution and its guarantees of separation. Moreover, I think that trying to outlaw something based on the prevailing views of one church or denomination over another would be problematic, given that different churches have varying stances on the issue.\n\nThe fact that some churchgoers, like Catholics, are opposed to the practice while others support it, further underscores the idea that it's not for the government to decide what's allowed or prohibited. The separation of church and state is essential for fostering religious tolerance in the US, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be contradictory to its original intent.\n\nIn fact, I think that such an amendment would be one of the few instances where the government would be restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting its own power. I strongly believe that the government should not be involved in this issue, especially when the push for an amendment seems to be driven by personal views rather than a genuine concern for the welfare of the country.\n\nTo me, it's hard to see how an amendment banning the practice would have a tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that it could have a positive effect by allowing individuals to make their own choices and decisions. Ultimately, I think it's up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government or any particular individual with a personal agenda.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on the war in Iraq, but I've been putting it off because I think the government didn't entirely be truthful with the American people about the reasons for the invasion. In my opinion, they tried to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but the two are not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the effects of 9/11, and that's when the invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nAs someone who's generally against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes, I think the war in Iraq is eerily similar to the Vietnam War in many ways. The US government should have learned from past mistakes, but instead, they seem to be repeating them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is absolutely tragic, and it's not just about the human cost – it's also about the fact that the US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing a country's government. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were predicted, but it seems the government didn't take these consequences into consideration.\n\nThe goal was to install a democratic government in Iraq, something that was also attempted in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that imposing a democracy on a foreign country is never an easy task, especially when faced with a large number of insurgents who are determined to resist. Fighting a war against a country's citizens is a much harder and more complex task than fighting a traditional army. \n\nIn my opinion, the US government was not well-prepared for this situation, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that the war would be a quick and easy victory. We've been in Iraq for over a decade now, and many American troops are still dying, and we're still training the Iraqi troops to police their own country – a process that will likely take years. It's clear that the US government underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful.\n\nLooking back at our own history, democracy was a long and difficult struggle to achieve in the US, with periods of civil war and tension. It's naive to think that the same process would be easy for another country. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and difficult process.\n\nAs for what to do now, it's a tough decision because we've been in Iraq for so long. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken responsibility for, but the cost in American lives and resources is becoming increasingly high. One of the main reasons we invaded Iraq was the promise of a democratic Iraq, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I believe the real reason is the oil issue – it's all about control and resources.\n\nIt's also worth noting that before the invasion, the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which are known to possess such weapons, are not being targeted. It's clear that the US government is not being thorough or truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nI can only hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that there will be peace in the country. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely.",
            "I'm a bit stammering here, but let's get to it – I'm for gay marriage. I've always been, to be honest. I genuinely believe it's a personal preference, and research has shown that it's more biological than sociological. It's not something people have control over, so it's inhumane to deny them rights due to it. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I think it's a matter of personal freedom and equality. \n\nI don't think government or politics should interfere with this issue, as it's a personal, household matter. In my neighborhood, I've seen gay couples living openly, and they function just like any other family – they walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and deserve the same respect as everyone else. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to redefine marriage in his own image, disregarding the complexity of the issue.\n\nResearch suggests that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing. For example, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father might not be predisposed to be gay just because of their environment. It's a matter of biology over sociology.\n\nThe main issue is that marriage is something people should be able to choose privately, without it being a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married in secret, they can do so without anyone knowing, but gay couples are often forced to deal with media attention. This highlights the stark difference between a private, personal issue and a public, national matter.\n\nTo me, it's clear that gay marriage should be a personal, private affair, not something subject to government or national scrutiny.",

            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. When it first started, the goal was understandable – to establish democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original purpose over time. Now, it feels like we're in it just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a powerful nation. I've always questioned the motives behind the war, given the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the intention was indeed to spread democracy, that would be a valid reason, but only if personal agendas weren't involved. Unfortunately, I believe that's not the case. I think we made our statement in the first few months of the war, but now it's been dragged out for far too long – over a year, in fact. We've had more than enough time to achieve our initial goal.\n\nIf we were genuinely trying to bring democracy to a nation ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. It's like we're more invested in the idea of being at war than in achieving a decisive victory or a clear outcome.\n\nI truly believe the war has gone on long enough. At some point, the Iraqi government will have to fend for itself, and I think that time has come. We're draining our economy by spending billions on this war when we have pressing issues on our own turf – poverty, internal conflicts, and infrastructure problems – that desperately need attention and funding. We should be prioritizing these issues instead of throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nIt's astonishing that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not even in our long-term budget. We have real problems that need funding – education, healthcare, public roads, and poverty alleviation. The money would be better spent on addressing these critical issues rather than sacrificing our own citizens in a foreign war that's already lost its cause. I think it's time to acknowledge that.",
            "I'm not sure if I can clarify this, but I was wondering about something. It turns out that someone was able to find out about it because they looked it up online.\n\nOkay, so it's not really an invasion of privacy, right? I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's like sharing it with the world. Like on Myspace, you kind of invite people to be your \"friend\" so they can see your profile. By doing that, you're basically giving them permission to see what you've shared.\n\nAnytime you put something online, you've got to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. So if someone was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from happening because they looked up your online info, that's actually a good thing, right?\n\nHowever, it's a bit of a tricky situation. On one hand, you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent problems. That would be unfair and discriminatory. On the other hand, if someone was specifically looking for info, they might be trying to do something malicious.\n\nI don't know, I guess it all depends on the situation. If someone was just browsing profiles and happened to find something suspicious, that's one thing. But if they were actively looking for evidence of something, that's different.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see all the stuff I've shared. I saw this TV show about a guy who was trying to prove how easily he could get people's info online. He managed to get a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger within minutes. It's scary to think about.\n\nIt's tough because you think people know your interests and other stuff about you, so it's hard to know who's really who online. Even if you limit what you post, there's still a lot of info out there. The thing is, I use Facebook to stay in touch with friends, but it's a trade-off between sharing too much or too little.\n\nI don't know, it's a complicated issue. My roommate was telling me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nI guess that's the only other thought I can think of.",
            "hmm, it's been a bit of a struggle to bring myself to talk about the Iraq War again, but it seems like it's one of those topics that can't be avoided. I'm aware that I might sound hypocritical, but I've been thinking a lot about this issue, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were opposed to the war from the start. I mean, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people, both in the US and globally, thought the war was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who refused to acknowledge their own mistakes.\n\nI've been following the polls, and it's evident that over 75-80% of the world's population, including Iraqis, US troops, and people from other parts of the globe, think that the war was a disaster. Even the soldiers on the ground consider it a bad idea and think we should withdraw within a year. It's been a complete mess since before we even intervened, and now the idea of pulling out seems just as catastrophic. The Middle East has always been a complex region, and the culture clash between the US and these countries is a significant contributor to our struggles there. It's not that I think Saddam was a good guy - he wasn't - but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a quagmire like it has.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq right now, and I haven't heard a compelling argument from the administration that convinces me otherwise. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I'm not opposed to that, but I just don't see any reason to stay any longer than we should. The fact that 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter of them think we should leave now, makes me wonder if we're listening to the people we're trying to help. I think they might know better than we do, and if we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. It's better to be the ones who made the decision to leave rather than being stuck in a situation where we're not making progress.",
            "You know, I think gender discrimination is still a pretty big issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; it's more related to the specific field of work you're in. For instance, even though there's supposed to be equality, women often face it tougher because of the \"glass ceiling\" - it's hard for men to find a job under a woman in charge, mainly because of how society's been raised over time. In the workplace, women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in leadership positions. \n\nIt's the same with men in certain industries, like being a stay-at-home dad, which is still not common. When a man decides to take on this role, people often look down on him because society expects men to be the breadwinners. It's tough on them because they might want to be involved in raising their kids and helping their partner with their career. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's another form of discrimination - people often don't take straight men seriously if they're interested in fashion. It's because traditionally, men who like fashion tend to have different lifestyles, and people might question whether they truly understand fashion or not. It's a bit like they're saying, \"How can I trust what you know about fashion if you can't even speak like a 'real' woman?\" It's weird, I know, but it's a thing.\n\nThe thing is, depending on the field of work, there's definitely gender discrimination in society. Changing this is difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is slow. It's happening, though, as women rise to leadership positions and become more accepted in the business world. The same goes for stay-at-home dads - people are starting to realize that maybe the female partner has the better job or wants to be the one working. \n\nTo promote change, you have to show people the good qualities of the people who are usually discriminated against without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good balance now where it's starting to become more accepted. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against, not just based on gender, but also based on where they're from or their education level. For instance, someone who grew up on a farm might have poor grammar but be extremely intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their grammar, even though they're incredibly smart. It's another example of how people can be discriminated against based on their background or education level.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out whether they legalized it or just decriminalized it. From what I understand, they took it down from a crime to something more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and booked. While this might seem like a good thing, I think people still worry about the long-term effects, even after decriminalization. I mean, a marijuana charge can still affect job prospects and other things, which can be pretty bad.\n\nHowever, there's another side to this. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and then let them go. Plus, there's the cost of court appearances, public defenders, and other expenses. When a city is financially struggling, they might not be willing to give up that money, even if it would free up some funds for other things.\n\nDenver's a bit of an exception, though. People there tend to be more open-minded and willing to try new things. And I think that's worked out okay for them, as they've been able to use the saved money for education, social programs, and other good causes.\n\nOf course, there are still valid reasons not to have marijuana everywhere. I'm not sure how I'd feel if it was totally legalized, to be honest. I mean, it could be sold in gas stations like cigarettes, and people might start smoking and driving, which wouldn't be great. Plus, it's still not really accepted in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward.\n\nI also think that marijuana can have some pretty significant effects on people's lifestyles, even if it doesn't necessarily affect their decision-making skills as much as alcohol does. But, like with anything, people react differently, and some folks are just more... let's say, resilient than others. So, it's hard to make general statements about the substance.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "So, I'd say yes to the idea of adapting certain traditional practices, considering they've been followed for a long time. It's good to have some roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be open to change. The thing is, a lot of Catholics believe in sticking to their weekly church attendance and being very strict about their practices. However, it often feels like they look down on those who don't follow their doctrine to the letter, and they don't accept people with different beliefs or those from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my parents are a good example - my mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. They wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they weren't allowed to because of my dad's religion. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is a fundamental principle. It's hypocritical when you say you're supposed to love others but then exclude them because of their differences. I think the Catholic Church often gets stuck on outdated ideas and sticks to them even though they contradict their own teachings.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not sure it would make a difference in the way some priests behave. It's a separate issue altogether. Even if priests were allowed to marry, some might still engage in certain behaviors because it's about the nature of their actions, not their marital status. So, in this case, I'm not convinced that allowing priests to get married would necessarily prevent those issues from happening.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this complex issue. I'm not quite sure which side has the stronger argument, but I do think this is one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. The line between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a tough one to tread without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm still undecided on how to approach it - all I know is that civil unions sound like a good starting point. I'm not convinced that marriage should be seen as a purely government-defined institution, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament by many people. If that's the case, then why would the government care about what kind of marriage it is? It's just about two people committing to each other, and that's what a civil union is. It shouldn't matter what the government thinks about the type of marriage it is - it's just about two people uniting.\n\nAs for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people entering into a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then they should push for it to become federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure to me. It's a big issue for some people, but not big enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's not a vital enough issue to redefine the constitution and ban gay marriage. To put it simply, I'm just not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to think.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a complicated view on homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. On one hand, I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it hard for me to take a firm stance against it. However, I still have some reservations about the lifestyle. Despite this, I think it should be legalized and not be a national issue that the president decides for the entire country. I believe that each state should have the freedom to make its own decision on the matter.\n\nI understand that some states are democratic and others are republican, and it's likely that democratic states will support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or bans gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with the decision. It's ultimately up to the individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves.\n\nWhat I do think is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. Given this, I believe that the decision on gay marriage should be left to each state to decide for themselves. I also think it's unfair for the president to impose his opinion on the whole country. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so why should he decide how each one runs itself? Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide for themselves, as they'll be the ones living with the consequences of that decision.",
            "Here's the issue - I don't want to post right now because I'm trying to figure out how to get my thoughts across, but essentially, I want to talk about Myspace and why I think school officials could have accessed my information on it. I suppose it's a public platform, like a bulletin board where you can post for everyone to see, and that's okay, but what if school officials see it? They could have checked it from home, even if it wasn't associated with the school's name. \n\nMy opinion is that if it means saving lives and keeping students safe, it's okay for them to check, even if it feels like an invasion of privacy. It's their responsibility to prevent school shootings, like what happened at Columbine. If they check Myspace to see if students are doing stuff they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay too, as long as it's not just to get them in trouble.\n\nIt's easy to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess that's not the point. It's a public thing, and if you post something on Myspace and don't expect to get in trouble, that's a bit naive. I'm worried about posting stuff online because I know it can come back to haunt me. If I post something negative about someone, it could be found later and cause problems. \n\nIf you do something as a college student that's not good, it can follow you later and get you in trouble. Once something's on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. School officials might not be looking for trouble, but if they find something that helps make the school a safer place, that's okay. They're just doing their job, like teachers who have to prepare for lockdowns and other safety measures.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that it's a public platform, but school officials have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, that's okay. They're not just trying to catch students, they're trying to prevent bad things from happening. I think that's a reasonable thing to do.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about the war and my initial reaction to it. I have to admit that I was fully on board with it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to see justice served and to create chaos in response to what happened over here. However, I think we got caught up in the emotions of the situation and overlooked the bigger picture. We charged in without a clear plan, and I genuinely believe that backfired on us.\n\nNow, I've done a complete turnaround and I'm strongly against the war. In my opinion, it didn't achieve anything. The people over there are too busy fighting among themselves to pose a threat to us, so our presence is doing more harm than good. The fact that they can't even put aside their differences to work together is quite telling.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 has left me with a sense of apathy towards the conflict in the Middle East. I struggle to care about their struggles because their concept of war is so different from ours. They seem to be more focused on driving us out than on improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them figure out their own problems.\n\nI believe our initial decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge and a knee-jerk reaction to the traumatic event. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand where he was coming from, I think we were ill-prepared for the consequences. We didn't have a clear plan for creating order or establishing a unified front. This lack of vision and unity ultimately led to more chaos and division.\n\nLooking back, I think we should have taken a more measured approach and had a solid plan in place before invading. In the end, I don't believe we're equipped to change the people of Iraq. They've been a complex and fragmented society for centuries, and it's unlikely that we can force them to become something else. Our continued presence is only exacerbating the situation, and I think we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nIt's a complex issue, and I don't have any easy answers. However, I do know that we need to reassess our role in the conflict and focus on finding a way out. The longer we stay, the more we'll be contributing to the instability and chaos in the region. It's time for us to acknowledge that we can't stay forever and start making plans for a peaceful exit."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nI feel like the war has been drawn out far too much \nI think the purpose was good in the beginning \nUm \nMeaning to restore democracy in another country \nBut \nI think we’ve long since lost sight of that purpose \nAnd \nWe’re now just maybe doing it for the sake of doing it \nJust to prove that we’re some sort of super power in the world \nI just think also maybe the motives were originally questionable dealing with \nUm \nGeorge Bush’s father’s previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein \nSo \nI think \nUm \nI think the original motivation if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system then that would be a fair motivation if there were any personal matters in it I do not think it would have been fair \nBut \nI do think it’s been drawn out \nUm \nI think we got our purpose across in the first couple months just starting the war I think that was a statement in and of itself \nBut \nThe fact that it has gone on for over a year several years \nI just think it’s way too drawn out \n\nUm \nYeah I think \nUm \nI mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country that was ruled by a tyrant I think that’s a just purpose \nAnd \nThat’s good reason for the war \nBut \nI don’t think \nI think our reason over time has been deteriorated \nAnd \nMisconceived \nJust like seems that we’re still at war for the purpose of going to war \nAnd \nWe don’t want to come out of this thing without a decisive end a victory or what not \n\nUm \nYeah I do think it has gone on long enough \nAnd \nIt should stop \nI mean there comes a point when their government \nTheir officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway \nAnd \nI think that time has come \nWe’ve long since been draining our own economy spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf such as poverty and what not that we should be spending that money on I think it’s a drain on our economy for a purpose that’s long since been drawn out \n\nYeah I mean they’re spending billions and billions of dollars \nAnd \nWar is not something that should be in our budget for the long term \nThere are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements \nYou know \nUm \nPublic roads or anything dealing with schools \nWe certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that \nHealth care that I think that money could be much better spent on \nRight now that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we’ve lost the cause for \n\nI think that’s it \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

They've been saying that they're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things. \n\nFor example, their views on gay marriages, abortions, and birth control are quite strict. While I understand that these are important issues, I think their views are a bit outdated in some ways. If they adapted to a more contemporary way of thinking, I think they'd be less concerned about losing their followers.\n\nHowever, it seems like a lot of people are starting to distance themselves from the Church due to their stance on these issues. They see the Church's views as being out of touch with modern society, which is causing disagreements and divisions. \n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, might make it difficult for people who support it to feel comfortable being part of the Church. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage might not want to be part of a community that views it as wrong. The same goes for other issues like the exclusion of female priests and married priests.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church claims that priests are devoted to God, but everyone else in the world has to balance their job with other aspects of their life, so why should priests be any different? It's not like having a family or other relationships would distract them from their faith.",
            "Honestly, I haven't really had much to say on the topic of gay marriage, but I do have a pretty clear opinion on it. In my view, being gay isn't something that someone chooses, it's just who they are. I don't think people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation, and it's not something that's within their control.\n\nTo me, it seems unfair that people can marry someone of the opposite sex, but not someone of the same sex. It just doesn't seem right to me. I've given it some thought, but to be honest, I haven't put a lot of effort into it because it just seems like a basic issue of equality.\n\nLike, we're all born with our own unique qualities and characteristics - some people are straight, while others are gay. It's not something that people can just decide or choose to be. I think it's unfair to hold gay people to a different standard just because of who they are.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any business getting involved in this issue. It's not a matter of national security, and it's not a moral issue in my opinion. It's just a matter of people being who they are and living their lives. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who people can and can't marry based on their own personal preferences.\n\nIt's hard to put into words, but it just seems like the government is overstepping its bounds when it comes to this issue. They're not addressing any real concerns or threats to society, they're just interfering with people's personal lives. And that's not right.\n\nI think that's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there isn't a valid argument against it. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The fact is that gay couples are vastly different from straight couples, and it's impossible to compare the two. They're like two sides of the same coin - they're fundamentally the same, but with some key differences. It's not like one is inherently better than the other.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is that gay couples are denied certain civil rights, such as the right to make medical decisions for each other or visit each other in the hospital. This is ridiculous, especially since many gay couples are committed to each other for life. Research has shown that homosexual couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples, and they have the same factors that contribute to a healthy relationship.\n\nThe real issue here is that gay couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church wedding. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, including the roles they play in their relationships, and they're just as capable of raising children as straight couples.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Children of gay couples are just as likely to adjust to society as children of straight couples, and they're not more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. The real issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, for example, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nIt's not about the parenting skills of gay couples, but about the societal attitudes towards them. It's not about whether or not children of gay couples will turn out okay, but about whether or not society will accept and support them. The federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal nationwide, and the proposed amendment should be rejected. President Bush's views on the matter are rooted in his own moral beliefs, but morality varies from person to person, and it's not up to the government to impose its own morality on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has stated that these claims are unfounded, and people should listen to research and studies rather than popular opinion or cultural norms. By doing so, we can start to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. People often assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it automatically has no benefits. But, in my opinion, that's not necessarily true. I'd say that for public availability, I'm against it, no question. However, for medical purposes, I believe it's a different story. A drug's illegality doesn't necessarily mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial in some cases, but I think you get my point.\n\nYeah, I mean think about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're prescribed because of their benefits, even though they're restricted. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of the stigma surrounding it, well, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should acknowledge its potential benefits instead.\n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol, since marijuana abuse can have different consequences. Although, like with alcohol, abusing it can lead to problems. It's a complex issue. I'd say we could integrate it into our society gradually, but not all at once, as that could lead to abuse. However, if we could just remove the stigma around marijuana, people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople have this horrible image of marijuana because it's a prohibited substance, but it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could change this perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has already made some changes to adapt to the 21st century. The atmosphere isn't as strict as it was when I was younger. I used to attend church every Sunday and would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just part of the routine, especially since I went to a private school where I'd see my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced a more casual teenage mass that lasts only 30 minutes. People now wear a lot more relaxed clothing, especially during the summer months when some even show up directly from the beach. Even during morning masses, which I used to dress up for, people often wear jeans and khakis, a far cry from the more formal attire of the past. To me, that's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\nAs for other issues, like the allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still develop pedophilic tendencies, and it's not solely because they're allowed or not allowed to get married. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and their attraction to young children isn't something that can be prevented by changing the church's stance on marriage. In fact, some religions already allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh Heaven's reverend or minister, so it's not a matter of whether they're allowed to get married, but rather a personal choice. \n\nI believe that pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that's developed due to upbringing or environment. While there might be some factors that contribute to it, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent these incidents from happening. If they knew about the abuse and were covering it up, then that's a different story, but in many cases, they might not have been aware. \n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any further thoughts to add.",
            "What got me going is that I think the initial premise was somewhat plausible, but the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was still too raw, and I believe it was used as a pretext for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration initially linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which we now know was a false narrative. This really put my hackles up, and the whole Iraq war still boils my blood.\n\nIt's hard to shake the feeling that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American public and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a severe breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the constitution has been evident since 9/11, and it's been a long-term strategy to marginalize it. I believe they had a plan to go to war from the start, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly stemming from his father's administration.\n\nThe alleged plan to expand our energy supply in the region, as revealed by a former Treasury Secretary in his book, adds fuel to the fire. It's an underhanded way to achieve this goal.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, I'm not convinced it's the right time to withdraw, as it could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current alternative, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the solution either, as it could create more problems in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty is at risk, and the interim government is struggling to maintain control.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is ineffective, and even the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. The return of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, is a significant concern. The political process is plagued by infighting and radical factions vying for control, making it a challenging and fractious environment.\n\nI'm at a loss for words to articulate my frustrations in polite company.",
            "I've been trying to think about the War in Iraq, but to be honest, it's a bit of a tough topic for me. I mean, it's not even like it was officially declared as a war, you know? It feels like we just sort of went after Iraq as a way of getting back at them for the 9/11 attacks. So, I haven't really been following it closely, I don't know the details, and I'm not sure what our main goals are anymore. I think we're trying to build democracy over there, but it feels like that's just a way of making Iraq like us, and we're also sort of using it as an excuse to get control of their oil resources. However, I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep sending our troops over there, because it's causing so much tension and hurting innocent people. It's like, if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, but that's going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up. I'm really not sure what to think.\n\nHonestly, I think the whole thing is kind of pointless now. I'm not even sure why we're still calling it a war when it was never officially declared by Congress. I think that's like, a requirement or something. And I'm not sure what our point is anymore. We're using guns to show that we're powerful and American, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep going. I think we should just call it what it is and try to find a way to get out of there without causing more harm.\n\nBut at the same time, I feel bad for the families of our soldiers who are over there, and I don't want them to get hurt. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end when I know that it's affecting so many people's lives. However, I do think that trying to impose our values and culture on Iraq is just going to make things worse for them in the long run. It's a whole different culture over there, and we're just going to end up causing more problems by trying to change them. And I think that's what's going to make the Al-Kaida thing even worse, and they'll just keep hating us more. So, I think this whole thing is just going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Honestly, I have some reservations about the notion that it's right for the government to declare something as legal or illegal, especially when it comes to issues that are largely under the purview of churches. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone principle in the US constitution, and I believe that trying to impose a particular stance on this issue would be a clear disregard for that fundamental principle.\n\nIn my view, attempting to legislate or enforce powers over these matters would be akin to defying the constitution and its guarantees of separation. Moreover, I think that trying to outlaw something based on the prevailing views of one church or denomination over another would be problematic, given that different churches have varying stances on the issue.\n\nThe fact that some churchgoers, like Catholics, are opposed to the practice while others support it, further underscores the idea that it's not for the government to decide what's allowed or prohibited. The separation of church and state is essential for fostering religious tolerance in the US, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be contradictory to its original intent.\n\nIn fact, I think that such an amendment would be one of the few instances where the government would be restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting its own power. I strongly believe that the government should not be involved in this issue, especially when the push for an amendment seems to be driven by personal views rather than a genuine concern for the welfare of the country.\n\nTo me, it's hard to see how an amendment banning the practice would have a tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that it could have a positive effect by allowing individuals to make their own choices and decisions. Ultimately, I think it's up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government or any particular individual with a personal agenda.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on the war in Iraq, but I've been putting it off because I think the government didn't entirely be truthful with the American people about the reasons for the invasion. In my opinion, they tried to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but the two are not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the effects of 9/11, and that's when the invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nAs someone who's generally against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes, I think the war in Iraq is eerily similar to the Vietnam War in many ways. The US government should have learned from past mistakes, but instead, they seem to be repeating them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is absolutely tragic, and it's not just about the human cost – it's also about the fact that the US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing a country's government. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were predicted, but it seems the government didn't take these consequences into consideration.\n\nThe goal was to install a democratic government in Iraq, something that was also attempted in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that imposing a democracy on a foreign country is never an easy task, especially when faced with a large number of insurgents who are determined to resist. Fighting a war against a country's citizens is a much harder and more complex task than fighting a traditional army. \n\nIn my opinion, the US government was not well-prepared for this situation, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that the war would be a quick and easy victory. We've been in Iraq for over a decade now, and many American troops are still dying, and we're still training the Iraqi troops to police their own country – a process that will likely take years. It's clear that the US government underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful.\n\nLooking back at our own history, democracy was a long and difficult struggle to achieve in the US, with periods of civil war and tension. It's naive to think that the same process would be easy for another country. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and difficult process.\n\nAs for what to do now, it's a tough decision because we've been in Iraq for so long. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken responsibility for, but the cost in American lives and resources is becoming increasingly high. One of the main reasons we invaded Iraq was the promise of a democratic Iraq, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I believe the real reason is the oil issue – it's all about control and resources.\n\nIt's also worth noting that before the invasion, the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which are known to possess such weapons, are not being targeted. It's clear that the US government is not being thorough or truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nI can only hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that there will be peace in the country. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely.",
            "I'm a bit stammering here, but let's get to it – I'm for gay marriage. I've always been, to be honest. I genuinely believe it's a personal preference, and research has shown that it's more biological than sociological. It's not something people have control over, so it's inhumane to deny them rights due to it. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I think it's a matter of personal freedom and equality. \n\nI don't think government or politics should interfere with this issue, as it's a personal, household matter. In my neighborhood, I've seen gay couples living openly, and they function just like any other family – they walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and deserve the same respect as everyone else. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to redefine marriage in his own image, disregarding the complexity of the issue.\n\nResearch suggests that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing. For example, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father might not be predisposed to be gay just because of their environment. It's a matter of biology over sociology.\n\nThe main issue is that marriage is something people should be able to choose privately, without it being a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married in secret, they can do so without anyone knowing, but gay couples are often forced to deal with media attention. This highlights the stark difference between a private, personal issue and a public, national matter.\n\nTo me, it's clear that gay marriage should be a personal, private affair, not something subject to government or national scrutiny.",

            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. When it first started, the goal was understandable – to establish democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original purpose over time. Now, it feels like we're in it just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a powerful nation. I've always questioned the motives behind the war, given the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the intention was indeed to spread democracy, that would be a valid reason, but only if personal agendas weren't involved. Unfortunately, I believe that's not the case. I think we made our statement in the first few months of the war, but now it's been dragged out for far too long – over a year, in fact. We've had more than enough time to achieve our initial goal.\n\nIf we were genuinely trying to bring democracy to a nation ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. It's like we're more invested in the idea of being at war than in achieving a decisive victory or a clear outcome.\n\nI truly believe the war has gone on long enough. At some point, the Iraqi government will have to fend for itself, and I think that time has come. We're draining our economy by spending billions on this war when we have pressing issues on our own turf – poverty, internal conflicts, and infrastructure problems – that desperately need attention and funding. We should be prioritizing these issues instead of throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nIt's astonishing that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not even in our long-term budget. We have real problems that need funding – education, healthcare, public roads, and poverty alleviation. The money would be better spent on addressing these critical issues rather than sacrificing our own citizens in a foreign war that's already lost its cause. I think it's time to acknowledge that.",
            "I'm not sure if I can clarify this, but I was wondering about something. It turns out that someone was able to find out about it because they looked it up online.\n\nOkay, so it's not really an invasion of privacy, right? I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's like sharing it with the world. Like on Myspace, you kind of invite people to be your \"friend\" so they can see your profile. By doing that, you're basically giving them permission to see what you've shared.\n\nAnytime you put something online, you've got to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. So if someone was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from happening because they looked up your online info, that's actually a good thing, right?\n\nHowever, it's a bit of a tricky situation. On one hand, you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent problems. That would be unfair and discriminatory. On the other hand, if someone was specifically looking for info, they might be trying to do something malicious.\n\nI don't know, I guess it all depends on the situation. If someone was just browsing profiles and happened to find something suspicious, that's one thing. But if they were actively looking for evidence of something, that's different.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see all the stuff I've shared. I saw this TV show about a guy who was trying to prove how easily he could get people's info online. He managed to get a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger within minutes. It's scary to think about.\n\nIt's tough because you think people know your interests and other stuff about you, so it's hard to know who's really who online. Even if you limit what you post, there's still a lot of info out there. The thing is, I use Facebook to stay in touch with friends, but it's a trade-off between sharing too much or too little.\n\nI don't know, it's a complicated issue. My roommate was telling me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nI guess that's the only other thought I can think of.",
            "hmm, it's been a bit of a struggle to bring myself to talk about the Iraq War again, but it seems like it's one of those topics that can't be avoided. I'm aware that I might sound hypocritical, but I've been thinking a lot about this issue, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were opposed to the war from the start. I mean, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people, both in the US and globally, thought the war was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who refused to acknowledge their own mistakes.\n\nI've been following the polls, and it's evident that over 75-80% of the world's population, including Iraqis, US troops, and people from other parts of the globe, think that the war was a disaster. Even the soldiers on the ground consider it a bad idea and think we should withdraw within a year. It's been a complete mess since before we even intervened, and now the idea of pulling out seems just as catastrophic. The Middle East has always been a complex region, and the culture clash between the US and these countries is a significant contributor to our struggles there. It's not that I think Saddam was a good guy - he wasn't - but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a quagmire like it has.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq right now, and I haven't heard a compelling argument from the administration that convinces me otherwise. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I'm not opposed to that, but I just don't see any reason to stay any longer than we should. The fact that 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter of them think we should leave now, makes me wonder if we're listening to the people we're trying to help. I think they might know better than we do, and if we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. It's better to be the ones who made the decision to leave rather than being stuck in a situation where we're not making progress.",
            "You know, I think gender discrimination is still a pretty big issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; it's more related to the specific field of work you're in. For instance, even though there's supposed to be equality, women often face it tougher because of the \"glass ceiling\" - it's hard for men to find a job under a woman in charge, mainly because of how society's been raised over time. In the workplace, women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in leadership positions. \n\nIt's the same with men in certain industries, like being a stay-at-home dad, which is still not common. When a man decides to take on this role, people often look down on him because society expects men to be the breadwinners. It's tough on them because they might want to be involved in raising their kids and helping their partner with their career. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's another form of discrimination - people often don't take straight men seriously if they're interested in fashion. It's because traditionally, men who like fashion tend to have different lifestyles, and people might question whether they truly understand fashion or not. It's a bit like they're saying, \"How can I trust what you know about fashion if you can't even speak like a 'real' woman?\" It's weird, I know, but it's a thing.\n\nThe thing is, depending on the field of work, there's definitely gender discrimination in society. Changing this is difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is slow. It's happening, though, as women rise to leadership positions and become more accepted in the business world. The same goes for stay-at-home dads - people are starting to realize that maybe the female partner has the better job or wants to be the one working. \n\nTo promote change, you have to show people the good qualities of the people who are usually discriminated against without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good balance now where it's starting to become more accepted. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against, not just based on gender, but also based on where they're from or their education level. For instance, someone who grew up on a farm might have poor grammar but be extremely intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their grammar, even though they're incredibly smart. It's another example of how people can be discriminated against based on their background or education level.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out whether they legalized it or just decriminalized it. From what I understand, they took it down from a crime to something more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and booked. While this might seem like a good thing, I think people still worry about the long-term effects, even after decriminalization. I mean, a marijuana charge can still affect job prospects and other things, which can be pretty bad.\n\nHowever, there's another side to this. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and then let them go. Plus, there's the cost of court appearances, public defenders, and other expenses. When a city is financially struggling, they might not be willing to give up that money, even if it would free up some funds for other things.\n\nDenver's a bit of an exception, though. People there tend to be more open-minded and willing to try new things. And I think that's worked out okay for them, as they've been able to use the saved money for education, social programs, and other good causes.\n\nOf course, there are still valid reasons not to have marijuana everywhere. I'm not sure how I'd feel if it was totally legalized, to be honest. I mean, it could be sold in gas stations like cigarettes, and people might start smoking and driving, which wouldn't be great. Plus, it's still not really accepted in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward.\n\nI also think that marijuana can have some pretty significant effects on people's lifestyles, even if it doesn't necessarily affect their decision-making skills as much as alcohol does. But, like with anything, people react differently, and some folks are just more... let's say, resilient than others. So, it's hard to make general statements about the substance.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "So, I'd say yes to the idea of adapting certain traditional practices, considering they've been followed for a long time. It's good to have some roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be open to change. The thing is, a lot of Catholics believe in sticking to their weekly church attendance and being very strict about their practices. However, it often feels like they look down on those who don't follow their doctrine to the letter, and they don't accept people with different beliefs or those from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my parents are a good example - my mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. They wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they weren't allowed to because of my dad's religion. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is a fundamental principle. It's hypocritical when you say you're supposed to love others but then exclude them because of their differences. I think the Catholic Church often gets stuck on outdated ideas and sticks to them even though they contradict their own teachings.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not sure it would make a difference in the way some priests behave. It's a separate issue altogether. Even if priests were allowed to marry, some might still engage in certain behaviors because it's about the nature of their actions, not their marital status. So, in this case, I'm not convinced that allowing priests to get married would necessarily prevent those issues from happening.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this complex issue. I'm not quite sure which side has the stronger argument, but I do think this is one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. The line between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a tough one to tread without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm still undecided on how to approach it - all I know is that civil unions sound like a good starting point. I'm not convinced that marriage should be seen as a purely government-defined institution, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament by many people. If that's the case, then why would the government care about what kind of marriage it is? It's just about two people committing to each other, and that's what a civil union is. It shouldn't matter what the government thinks about the type of marriage it is - it's just about two people uniting.\n\nAs for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people entering into a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then they should push for it to become federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure to me. It's a big issue for some people, but not big enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's not a vital enough issue to redefine the constitution and ban gay marriage. To put it simply, I'm just not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to think.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a complicated view on homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. On one hand, I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it hard for me to take a firm stance against it. However, I still have some reservations about the lifestyle. Despite this, I think it should be legalized and not be a national issue that the president decides for the entire country. I believe that each state should have the freedom to make its own decision on the matter.\n\nI understand that some states are democratic and others are republican, and it's likely that democratic states will support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or bans gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with the decision. It's ultimately up to the individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves.\n\nWhat I do think is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. Given this, I believe that the decision on gay marriage should be left to each state to decide for themselves. I also think it's unfair for the president to impose his opinion on the whole country. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so why should he decide how each one runs itself? Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide for themselves, as they'll be the ones living with the consequences of that decision.",
            "Here's the issue - I don't want to post right now because I'm trying to figure out how to get my thoughts across, but essentially, I want to talk about Myspace and why I think school officials could have accessed my information on it. I suppose it's a public platform, like a bulletin board where you can post for everyone to see, and that's okay, but what if school officials see it? They could have checked it from home, even if it wasn't associated with the school's name. \n\nMy opinion is that if it means saving lives and keeping students safe, it's okay for them to check, even if it feels like an invasion of privacy. It's their responsibility to prevent school shootings, like what happened at Columbine. If they check Myspace to see if students are doing stuff they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay too, as long as it's not just to get them in trouble.\n\nIt's easy to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess that's not the point. It's a public thing, and if you post something on Myspace and don't expect to get in trouble, that's a bit naive. I'm worried about posting stuff online because I know it can come back to haunt me. If I post something negative about someone, it could be found later and cause problems. \n\nIf you do something as a college student that's not good, it can follow you later and get you in trouble. Once something's on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. School officials might not be looking for trouble, but if they find something that helps make the school a safer place, that's okay. They're just doing their job, like teachers who have to prepare for lockdowns and other safety measures.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that it's a public platform, but school officials have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, that's okay. They're not just trying to catch students, they're trying to prevent bad things from happening. I think that's a reasonable thing to do.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about the war and my initial reaction to it. I have to admit that I was fully on board with it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to see justice served and to create chaos in response to what happened over here. However, I think we got caught up in the emotions of the situation and overlooked the bigger picture. We charged in without a clear plan, and I genuinely believe that backfired on us.\n\nNow, I've done a complete turnaround and I'm strongly against the war. In my opinion, it didn't achieve anything. The people over there are too busy fighting among themselves to pose a threat to us, so our presence is doing more harm than good. The fact that they can't even put aside their differences to work together is quite telling.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 has left me with a sense of apathy towards the conflict in the Middle East. I struggle to care about their struggles because their concept of war is so different from ours. They seem to be more focused on driving us out than on improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them figure out their own problems.\n\nI believe our initial decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge and a knee-jerk reaction to the traumatic event. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand where he was coming from, I think we were ill-prepared for the consequences. We didn't have a clear plan for creating order or establishing a unified front. This lack of vision and unity ultimately led to more chaos and division.\n\nLooking back, I think we should have taken a more measured approach and had a solid plan in place before invading. In the end, I don't believe we're equipped to change the people of Iraq. They've been a complex and fragmented society for centuries, and it's unlikely that we can force them to become something else. Our continued presence is only exacerbating the situation, and I think we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nIt's a complex issue, and I don't have any easy answers. However, I do know that we need to reassess our role in the conflict and focus on finding a way out. The longer we stay, the more we'll be contributing to the instability and chaos in the region. It's time for us to acknowledge that we can't stay forever and start making plans for a peaceful exit."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think there are a few areas where the Catholic Church needs to modernize its views. I believe that the Church's stance on several issues is one of the reasons it's losing followers. They've been saying that they're losing followers, and I think it's because they're not very accepting of certain things. \n\nFor example, their views on gay marriages, abortions, and birth control are quite strict. While I understand that these are important issues, I think their views are a bit outdated in some ways. If they adapted to a more contemporary way of thinking, I think they'd be less concerned about losing their followers.\n\nHowever, it seems like a lot of people are starting to distance themselves from the Church due to their stance on these issues. They see the Church's views as being out of touch with modern society, which is causing disagreements and divisions. \n\nThe Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, might make it difficult for people who support it to feel comfortable being part of the Church. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage might not want to be part of a community that views it as wrong. The same goes for other issues like the exclusion of female priests and married priests.\n\nPersonally, I don't see why priests can't be married or have female priests. The Church claims that priests are devoted to God, but everyone else in the world has to balance their job with other aspects of their life, so why should priests be any different? It's not like having a family or other relationships would distract them from their faith.",
            "Honestly, I haven't really had much to say on the topic of gay marriage, but I do have a pretty clear opinion on it. In my view, being gay isn't something that someone chooses, it's just who they are. I don't think people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation, and it's not something that's within their control.\n\nTo me, it seems unfair that people can marry someone of the opposite sex, but not someone of the same sex. It just doesn't seem right to me. I've given it some thought, but to be honest, I haven't put a lot of effort into it because it just seems like a basic issue of equality.\n\nLike, we're all born with our own unique qualities and characteristics - some people are straight, while others are gay. It's not something that people can just decide or choose to be. I think it's unfair to hold gay people to a different standard just because of who they are.\n\nI don't think the federal government has any business getting involved in this issue. It's not a matter of national security, and it's not a moral issue in my opinion. It's just a matter of people being who they are and living their lives. I don't think the government should be able to dictate who people can and can't marry based on their own personal preferences.\n\nIt's hard to put into words, but it just seems like the government is overstepping its bounds when it comes to this issue. They're not addressing any real concerns or threats to society, they're just interfering with people's personal lives. And that's not right.\n\nI think that's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there isn't a valid argument against it. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misconception. The fact is that gay couples are vastly different from straight couples, and it's impossible to compare the two. They're like two sides of the same coin - they're fundamentally the same, but with some key differences. It's not like one is inherently better than the other.\n\nOne of the biggest issues is that gay couples are denied certain civil rights, such as the right to make medical decisions for each other or visit each other in the hospital. This is ridiculous, especially since many gay couples are committed to each other for life. Research has shown that homosexual couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples, and they have the same factors that contribute to a healthy relationship.\n\nThe real issue here is that gay couples are asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, not a church wedding. If we're allowing civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Gay couples are the same in many ways, including the roles they play in their relationships, and they're just as capable of raising children as straight couples.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Children of gay couples are just as likely to adjust to society as children of straight couples, and they're not more likely to be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. The real issue is how children of gay couples are treated by their peers and other adults in society. In cities like New York, for example, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nIt's not about the parenting skills of gay couples, but about the societal attitudes towards them. It's not about whether or not children of gay couples will turn out okay, but about whether or not society will accept and support them. The federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal nationwide, and the proposed amendment should be rejected. President Bush's views on the matter are rooted in his own moral beliefs, but morality varies from person to person, and it's not up to the government to impose its own morality on the rest of the country.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is simply not true. The American Psychological Association has stated that these claims are unfounded, and people should listen to research and studies rather than popular opinion or cultural norms. By doing so, we can start to see the world in a different light.",
            "Okay, so, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. People often assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it automatically has no benefits. But, in my opinion, that's not necessarily true. I'd say that for public availability, I'm against it, no question. However, for medical purposes, I believe it's a different story. A drug's illegality doesn't necessarily mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial in some cases, but I think you get my point.\n\nYeah, I mean think about it, there are plenty of controlled substances that pharmacies use all the time, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. They're prescribed because of their benefits, even though they're restricted. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because of the stigma surrounding it, well, that doesn't make sense to me. I think we should acknowledge its potential benefits instead.\n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol, since marijuana abuse can have different consequences. Although, like with alcohol, abusing it can lead to problems. It's a complex issue. I'd say we could integrate it into our society gradually, but not all at once, as that could lead to abuse. However, if we could just remove the stigma around marijuana, people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople have this horrible image of marijuana because it's a prohibited substance, but it's not as bad for you as heroin or cocaine. If we could change this perception, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has already made some changes to adapt to the 21st century. The atmosphere isn't as strict as it was when I was younger. I used to attend church every Sunday and would always dress up in cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just part of the routine, especially since I went to a private school where I'd see my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced a more casual teenage mass that lasts only 30 minutes. People now wear a lot more relaxed clothing, especially during the summer months when some even show up directly from the beach. Even during morning masses, which I used to dress up for, people often wear jeans and khakis, a far cry from the more formal attire of the past. To me, that's the biggest change I've noticed. \n\nAs for other issues, like the allegations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still develop pedophilic tendencies, and it's not solely because they're allowed or not allowed to get married. It's the individual's choice to become a priest, and their attraction to young children isn't something that can be prevented by changing the church's stance on marriage. In fact, some religions already allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh Heaven's reverend or minister, so it's not a matter of whether they're allowed to get married, but rather a personal choice. \n\nI believe that pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that's developed due to upbringing or environment. While there might be some factors that contribute to it, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent these incidents from happening. If they knew about the abuse and were covering it up, then that's a different story, but in many cases, they might not have been aware. \n\nThat's my take on the Catholic Church. I don't have any further thoughts to add.",
            "What got me going is that I think the initial premise was somewhat plausible, but the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was still too raw, and I believe it was used as a pretext for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration initially linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which we now know was a false narrative. This really put my hackles up, and the whole Iraq war still boils my blood.\n\nIt's hard to shake the feeling that the Bush administration deliberately misled the American public and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a severe breach of trust, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\n\nThe Bush administration's disregard for the constitution has been evident since 9/11, and it's been a long-term strategy to marginalize it. I believe they had a plan to go to war from the start, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly stemming from his father's administration.\n\nThe alleged plan to expand our energy supply in the region, as revealed by a former Treasury Secretary in his book, adds fuel to the fire. It's an underhanded way to achieve this goal.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on long enough, I'm not convinced it's the right time to withdraw, as it could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current alternative, which involves a coalition of surrounding nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the solution either, as it could create more problems in the long run. Iraq's sovereignty is at risk, and the interim government is struggling to maintain control.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is ineffective, and even the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. The return of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, is a significant concern. The political process is plagued by infighting and radical factions vying for control, making it a challenging and fractious environment.\n\nI'm at a loss for words to articulate my frustrations in polite company.",
            "I've been trying to think about the War in Iraq, but to be honest, it's a bit of a tough topic for me. I mean, it's not even like it was officially declared as a war, you know? It feels like we just sort of went after Iraq as a way of getting back at them for the 9/11 attacks. So, I haven't really been following it closely, I don't know the details, and I'm not sure what our main goals are anymore. I think we're trying to build democracy over there, but it feels like that's just a way of making Iraq like us, and we're also sort of using it as an excuse to get control of their oil resources. However, I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep sending our troops over there, because it's causing so much tension and hurting innocent people. It's like, if we stay, we'll have to try to create democracy, but that's going to take forever, and if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up. I'm really not sure what to think.\n\nHonestly, I think the whole thing is kind of pointless now. I'm not even sure why we're still calling it a war when it was never officially declared by Congress. I think that's like, a requirement or something. And I'm not sure what our point is anymore. We're using guns to show that we're powerful and American, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to keep going. I think we should just call it what it is and try to find a way to get out of there without causing more harm.\n\nBut at the same time, I feel bad for the families of our soldiers who are over there, and I don't want them to get hurt. And it's hard to say that I want the war to end when I know that it's affecting so many people's lives. However, I do think that trying to impose our values and culture on Iraq is just going to make things worse for them in the long run. It's a whole different culture over there, and we're just going to end up causing more problems by trying to change them. And I think that's what's going to make the Al-Kaida thing even worse, and they'll just keep hating us more. So, I think this whole thing is just going to drag on for years and years.",
            "Honestly, I have some reservations about the notion that it's right for the government to declare something as legal or illegal, especially when it comes to issues that are largely under the purview of churches. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone principle in the US constitution, and I believe that trying to impose a particular stance on this issue would be a clear disregard for that fundamental principle.\n\nIn my view, attempting to legislate or enforce powers over these matters would be akin to defying the constitution and its guarantees of separation. Moreover, I think that trying to outlaw something based on the prevailing views of one church or denomination over another would be problematic, given that different churches have varying stances on the issue.\n\nThe fact that some churchgoers, like Catholics, are opposed to the practice while others support it, further underscores the idea that it's not for the government to decide what's allowed or prohibited. The separation of church and state is essential for fostering religious tolerance in the US, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict this principle would be contradictory to its original intent.\n\nIn fact, I think that such an amendment would be one of the few instances where the government would be restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting its own power. I strongly believe that the government should not be involved in this issue, especially when the push for an amendment seems to be driven by personal views rather than a genuine concern for the welfare of the country.\n\nTo me, it's hard to see how an amendment banning the practice would have a tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that it could have a positive effect by allowing individuals to make their own choices and decisions. Ultimately, I think it's up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government or any particular individual with a personal agenda.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on the war in Iraq, but I've been putting it off because I think the government didn't entirely be truthful with the American people about the reasons for the invasion. In my opinion, they tried to link the war in Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but the two are not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were still reeling from the effects of 9/11, and that's when the invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nAs someone who's generally against war, especially when it comes to preemptive strikes, I think the war in Iraq is eerily similar to the Vietnam War in many ways. The US government should have learned from past mistakes, but instead, they seem to be repeating them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is absolutely tragic, and it's not just about the human cost – it's also about the fact that the US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing a country's government. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were predicted, but it seems the government didn't take these consequences into consideration.\n\nThe goal was to install a democratic government in Iraq, something that was also attempted in Vietnam. However, the US government should have known that imposing a democracy on a foreign country is never an easy task, especially when faced with a large number of insurgents who are determined to resist. Fighting a war against a country's citizens is a much harder and more complex task than fighting a traditional army. \n\nIn my opinion, the US government was not well-prepared for this situation, and they tried to deceive the American people into believing that the war would be a quick and easy victory. We've been in Iraq for over a decade now, and many American troops are still dying, and we're still training the Iraqi troops to police their own country – a process that will likely take years. It's clear that the US government underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government and making it successful.\n\nLooking back at our own history, democracy was a long and difficult struggle to achieve in the US, with periods of civil war and tension. It's naive to think that the same process would be easy for another country. The US government made it seem like a relatively simple task, but in reality, it's a complex and difficult process.\n\nAs for what to do now, it's a tough decision because we've been in Iraq for so long. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken responsibility for, but the cost in American lives and resources is becoming increasingly high. One of the main reasons we invaded Iraq was the promise of a democratic Iraq, but if that's the case, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I believe the real reason is the oil issue – it's all about control and resources.\n\nIt's also worth noting that before the invasion, the US government claimed Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were ever found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which are known to possess such weapons, are not being targeted. It's clear that the US government is not being thorough or truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nI can only hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that there will be peace in the country. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely.",
            "I'm a bit stammering here, but let's get to it – I'm for gay marriage. I've always been, to be honest. I genuinely believe it's a personal preference, and research has shown that it's more biological than sociological. It's not something people have control over, so it's inhumane to deny them rights due to it. As someone who's always advocated for gay marriage, I think it's a matter of personal freedom and equality. \n\nI don't think government or politics should interfere with this issue, as it's a personal, household matter. In my neighborhood, I've seen gay couples living openly, and they function just like any other family – they walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and deserve the same respect as everyone else. It's ridiculous that Bush is trying to redefine marriage in his own image, disregarding the complexity of the issue.\n\nResearch suggests that being gay might be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than environmental factors like upbringing. For example, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father might not be predisposed to be gay just because of their environment. It's a matter of biology over sociology.\n\nThe main issue is that marriage is something people should be able to choose privately, without it being a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married in secret, they can do so without anyone knowing, but gay couples are often forced to deal with media attention. This highlights the stark difference between a private, personal issue and a public, national matter.\n\nTo me, it's clear that gay marriage should be a personal, private affair, not something subject to government or national scrutiny.",

            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for far too long. When it first started, the goal was understandable – to establish democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original purpose over time. Now, it feels like we're in it just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a powerful nation. I've always questioned the motives behind the war, given the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the intention was indeed to spread democracy, that would be a valid reason, but only if personal agendas weren't involved. Unfortunately, I believe that's not the case. I think we made our statement in the first few months of the war, but now it's been dragged out for far too long – over a year, in fact. We've had more than enough time to achieve our initial goal.\n\nIf we were genuinely trying to bring democracy to a nation ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I believe our reasons have become distorted over time, and we're now fighting for the sake of fighting. It's like we're more invested in the idea of being at war than in achieving a decisive victory or a clear outcome.\n\nI truly believe the war has gone on long enough. At some point, the Iraqi government will have to fend for itself, and I think that time has come. We're draining our economy by spending billions on this war when we have pressing issues on our own turf – poverty, internal conflicts, and infrastructure problems – that desperately need attention and funding. We should be prioritizing these issues instead of throwing money at a war that's lost its purpose.\n\nIt's astonishing that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not even in our long-term budget. We have real problems that need funding – education, healthcare, public roads, and poverty alleviation. The money would be better spent on addressing these critical issues rather than sacrificing our own citizens in a foreign war that's already lost its cause. I think it's time to acknowledge that.",
            "I'm not sure if I can clarify this, but I was wondering about something. It turns out that someone was able to find out about it because they looked it up online.\n\nOkay, so it's not really an invasion of privacy, right? I mean, if you post stuff on the internet, it's like sharing it with the world. Like on Myspace, you kind of invite people to be your \"friend\" so they can see your profile. By doing that, you're basically giving them permission to see what you've shared.\n\nAnytime you put something online, you've got to understand that a lot of people are going to see it. So if someone was able to prevent a potentially serious situation from happening because they looked up your online info, that's actually a good thing, right?\n\nHowever, it's a bit of a tricky situation. On one hand, you can't have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent problems. That would be unfair and discriminatory. On the other hand, if someone was specifically looking for info, they might be trying to do something malicious.\n\nI don't know, I guess it all depends on the situation. If someone was just browsing profiles and happened to find something suspicious, that's one thing. But if they were actively looking for evidence of something, that's different.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace, but I do have a Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see all the stuff I've shared. I saw this TV show about a guy who was trying to prove how easily he could get people's info online. He managed to get a girl's screen name and started talking to her on instant messenger within minutes. It's scary to think about.\n\nIt's tough because you think people know your interests and other stuff about you, so it's hard to know who's really who online. Even if you limit what you post, there's still a lot of info out there. The thing is, I use Facebook to stay in touch with friends, but it's a trade-off between sharing too much or too little.\n\nI don't know, it's a complicated issue. My roommate was telling me that her high school banned students from having Myspace, which seemed strange to me. I'm not sure how they had the authority to do that.\n\nI guess that's the only other thought I can think of.",
            "hmm, it's been a bit of a struggle to bring myself to talk about the Iraq War again, but it seems like it's one of those topics that can't be avoided. I'm aware that I might sound hypocritical, but I've been thinking a lot about this issue, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable jumping on the bandwagon of people who claim they were opposed to the war from the start. I mean, looking back, it's clear that the majority of people, both in the US and globally, thought the war was a bad idea, except for those within the administration who refused to acknowledge their own mistakes.\n\nI've been following the polls, and it's evident that over 75-80% of the world's population, including Iraqis, US troops, and people from other parts of the globe, think that the war was a disaster. Even the soldiers on the ground consider it a bad idea and think we should withdraw within a year. It's been a complete mess since before we even intervened, and now the idea of pulling out seems just as catastrophic. The Middle East has always been a complex region, and the culture clash between the US and these countries is a significant contributor to our struggles there. It's not that I think Saddam was a good guy - he wasn't - but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into a quagmire like it has.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq right now, and I haven't heard a compelling argument from the administration that convinces me otherwise. If they want to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I'm not opposed to that, but I just don't see any reason to stay any longer than we should. The fact that 80% of Iraqis think we should leave within a year, and at least a quarter of them think we should leave now, makes me wonder if we're listening to the people we're trying to help. I think they might know better than we do, and if we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. It's better to be the ones who made the decision to leave rather than being stuck in a situation where we're not making progress.",
            "You know, I think gender discrimination is still a pretty big issue in the United States. It's not just a women's problem, though; it's more related to the specific field of work you're in. For instance, even though there's supposed to be equality, women often face it tougher because of the \"glass ceiling\" - it's hard for men to find a job under a woman in charge, mainly because of how society's been raised over time. In the workplace, women might have all the qualifications for a job, but the board might not promote them because historically, women haven't been in leadership positions. \n\nIt's the same with men in certain industries, like being a stay-at-home dad, which is still not common. When a man decides to take on this role, people often look down on him because society expects men to be the breadwinners. It's tough on them because they might want to be involved in raising their kids and helping their partner with their career. \n\nIn the fashion industry, there's another form of discrimination - people often don't take straight men seriously if they're interested in fashion. It's because traditionally, men who like fashion tend to have different lifestyles, and people might question whether they truly understand fashion or not. It's a bit like they're saying, \"How can I trust what you know about fashion if you can't even speak like a 'real' woman?\" It's weird, I know, but it's a thing.\n\nThe thing is, depending on the field of work, there's definitely gender discrimination in society. Changing this is difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've come a long way since the 1800s, but progress is slow. It's happening, though, as women rise to leadership positions and become more accepted in the business world. The same goes for stay-at-home dads - people are starting to realize that maybe the female partner has the better job or wants to be the one working. \n\nTo promote change, you have to show people the good qualities of the people who are usually discriminated against without being too pushy. If you force it, people will resist. I think we're at a good balance now where it's starting to become more accepted. \n\nIt's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds can be discriminated against, not just based on gender, but also based on where they're from or their education level. For instance, someone who grew up on a farm might have poor grammar but be extremely intelligent and work their way up to a CEO position. Other men might look down on them because of their grammar, even though they're incredibly smart. It's another example of how people can be discriminated against based on their background or education level.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to figure out whether they legalized it or just decriminalized it. From what I understand, they took it down from a crime to something more like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and booked. While this might seem like a good thing, I think people still worry about the long-term effects, even after decriminalization. I mean, a marijuana charge can still affect job prospects and other things, which can be pretty bad.\n\nHowever, there's another side to this. Arresting and prosecuting people for marijuana possession is expensive. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and then let them go. Plus, there's the cost of court appearances, public defenders, and other expenses. When a city is financially struggling, they might not be willing to give up that money, even if it would free up some funds for other things.\n\nDenver's a bit of an exception, though. People there tend to be more open-minded and willing to try new things. And I think that's worked out okay for them, as they've been able to use the saved money for education, social programs, and other good causes.\n\nOf course, there are still valid reasons not to have marijuana everywhere. I'm not sure how I'd feel if it was totally legalized, to be honest. I mean, it could be sold in gas stations like cigarettes, and people might start smoking and driving, which wouldn't be great. Plus, it's still not really accepted in many places, so having it out in the open might be awkward.\n\nI also think that marijuana can have some pretty significant effects on people's lifestyles, even if it doesn't necessarily affect their decision-making skills as much as alcohol does. But, like with anything, people react differently, and some folks are just more... let's say, resilient than others. So, it's hard to make general statements about the substance.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the matter.",
            "So, I'd say yes to the idea of adapting certain traditional practices, considering they've been followed for a long time. It's good to have some roots in tradition, but it's also essential to be open to change. The thing is, a lot of Catholics believe in sticking to their weekly church attendance and being very strict about their practices. However, it often feels like they look down on those who don't follow their doctrine to the letter, and they don't accept people with different beliefs or those from other religions.\n\nFor instance, my parents are a good example - my mom was Catholic, and my dad was Episcopalian. They wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they weren't allowed to because of my dad's religion. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is a fundamental principle. It's hypocritical when you say you're supposed to love others but then exclude them because of their differences. I think the Catholic Church often gets stuck on outdated ideas and sticks to them even though they contradict their own teachings.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I'm not sure it would make a difference in the way some priests behave. It's a separate issue altogether. Even if priests were allowed to marry, some might still engage in certain behaviors because it's about the nature of their actions, not their marital status. So, in this case, I'm not convinced that allowing priests to get married would necessarily prevent those issues from happening.",
            "To be honest, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this complex issue. I'm not quite sure which side has the stronger argument, but I do think this is one of the most contentious topics we're facing today. The line between separating church and state, and defining marriage is a tough one to tread without offending anyone. To be honest, I'm still undecided on how to approach it - all I know is that civil unions sound like a good starting point. I'm not convinced that marriage should be seen as a purely government-defined institution, especially since it's often viewed as a sacrament by many people. If that's the case, then why would the government care about what kind of marriage it is? It's just about two people committing to each other, and that's what a civil union is. It shouldn't matter what the government thinks about the type of marriage it is - it's just about two people uniting.\n\nAs for gay marriage, it's basically the same thing - two people entering into a civil union. If all the states can come to a logical agreement, then they should push for it to become federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage seems like a drastic measure to me. It's a big issue for some people, but not big enough to warrant amending the constitution. It's not a vital enough issue to redefine the constitution and ban gay marriage. To put it simply, I'm just not convinced that it's worth it.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what to think.",
            "Honestly, I have a bit of a complicated view on homosexuality because I was raised in a Christian home. On one hand, I have a lot of gay friends, which makes it hard for me to take a firm stance against it. However, I still have some reservations about the lifestyle. Despite this, I think it should be legalized and not be a national issue that the president decides for the entire country. I believe that each state should have the freedom to make its own decision on the matter.\n\nI understand that some states are democratic and others are republican, and it's likely that democratic states will support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or bans gay marriage, I don't think you should disagree with the decision. It's ultimately up to the individual states to decide how they want to govern themselves.\n\nWhat I do think is that homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals. Given this, I believe that the decision on gay marriage should be left to each state to decide for themselves. I also think it's unfair for the president to impose his opinion on the whole country. I mean, he doesn't live in every state, so why should he decide how each one runs itself? Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and if a future president decides to lift the ban, it'll just go back and forth. It's better to let each state decide for themselves, as they'll be the ones living with the consequences of that decision.",
            "Here's the issue - I don't want to post right now because I'm trying to figure out how to get my thoughts across, but essentially, I want to talk about Myspace and why I think school officials could have accessed my information on it. I suppose it's a public platform, like a bulletin board where you can post for everyone to see, and that's okay, but what if school officials see it? They could have checked it from home, even if it wasn't associated with the school's name. \n\nMy opinion is that if it means saving lives and keeping students safe, it's okay for them to check, even if it feels like an invasion of privacy. It's their responsibility to prevent school shootings, like what happened at Columbine. If they check Myspace to see if students are doing stuff they shouldn't be, like drinking or smoking, I think that's okay too, as long as it's not just to get them in trouble.\n\nIt's easy to express yourself when you're writing, but I guess that's not the point. It's a public thing, and if you post something on Myspace and don't expect to get in trouble, that's a bit naive. I'm worried about posting stuff online because I know it can come back to haunt me. If I post something negative about someone, it could be found later and cause problems. \n\nIf you do something as a college student that's not good, it can follow you later and get you in trouble. Once something's on the internet, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. School officials might not be looking for trouble, but if they find something that helps make the school a safer place, that's okay. They're just doing their job, like teachers who have to prepare for lockdowns and other safety measures.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that it's a public platform, but school officials have a responsibility to keep students safe, and if that means checking Myspace, that's okay. They're not just trying to catch students, they're trying to prevent bad things from happening. I think that's a reasonable thing to do.",
            "I've been thinking a lot about the war and my initial reaction to it. I have to admit that I was fully on board with it at first because it hit close to home after 9/11. I wanted to see justice served and to create chaos in response to what happened over here. However, I think we got caught up in the emotions of the situation and overlooked the bigger picture. We charged in without a clear plan, and I genuinely believe that backfired on us.\n\nNow, I've done a complete turnaround and I'm strongly against the war. In my opinion, it didn't achieve anything. The people over there are too busy fighting among themselves to pose a threat to us, so our presence is doing more harm than good. The fact that they can't even put aside their differences to work together is quite telling.\n\nUnfortunately, 9/11 has left me with a sense of apathy towards the conflict in the Middle East. I struggle to care about their struggles because their concept of war is so different from ours. They seem to be more focused on driving us out than on improving their own country. I think it's time for us to leave and let them figure out their own problems.\n\nI believe our initial decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge and a knee-jerk reaction to the traumatic event. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand where he was coming from, I think we were ill-prepared for the consequences. We didn't have a clear plan for creating order or establishing a unified front. This lack of vision and unity ultimately led to more chaos and division.\n\nLooking back, I think we should have taken a more measured approach and had a solid plan in place before invading. In the end, I don't believe we're equipped to change the people of Iraq. They've been a complex and fragmented society for centuries, and it's unlikely that we can force them to become something else. Our continued presence is only exacerbating the situation, and I think we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nIt's a complex issue, and I don't have any easy answers. However, I do know that we need to reassess our role in the conflict and focus on finding a way out. The longer we stay, the more we'll be contributing to the instability and chaos in the region. It's time for us to acknowledge that we can't stay forever and start making plans for a peaceful exit."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

\nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to reassess its stance on several issues. Many people have been discussing the decline in the Church's following, and I believe it's because the Church is often not very accepting of various things.\n\nFor instance, their views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control are quite rigid, which is understandable, but also somewhat outdated. If the Church were to be more open to modern perspectives, it wouldn't lose its followers. Instead, people are starting to turn against the Church's stance on these issues and view them as outdated.\n\nSome individuals are even choosing not to follow the Church because of its views on topics like abortion and gay marriage. The Church's stance against abortion means that those who support it might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. Similarly, those who believe in and want to practice gay marriage might not feel at home in a community that doesn't support it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented the Church's problems entirely. Perhaps allowing priests to be married or having female priests might have changed things, but it's hard to say for certain.\n\nThe idea that priests can't be married because they're \"married to God\" doesn't sit well with me. Everyone else in the world has a job and a personal life, so why can't priests have both? It's a bit illogical to expect them to dedicate their entire lives to the Church without any personal relationships.",
            "I haven't really been able to articulate my thoughts on the issue of gay marriage, but I wanted to take a moment to share my perspective. To be clear, I don't have any issue with gay marriage in general. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose, but rather something they're born with. So, I don't think it's fair to hold them accountable for it. It seems to me that it's not a matter of personal choice, but rather a fundamental aspect of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, I do believe it's unjust to deny gay couples the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation. It's not like they've made a conscious decision to be gay; they're just being themselves. I think it's essential to recognize and respect that.\n\nIn my view, the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral concerns. It's simply a personal matter that doesn't affect anyone else. I think it's unfair for the government to interfere in people's private lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as their relationships and identities. Let's face it, people are born gay, and they shouldn't be punished for being themselves.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "i think that gay marriage should be legalized. here's why: there's just no good reason not to. people often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's really not the same thing. it's like comparing apples and oranges - two different sides of the same coin. you can't have heads without tails, and the same goes for these relationships. they're just as valid, with their own set of civil rights, like property taxes and healthcare benefits. for example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital because they're not considered family, which is pretty silly considering you're planning to spend the rest of your life together. research has shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as straight couples do.\n\nthe issue is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church - they're asking for a legal marriage certificate from the government. this should be a no-brainer, especially if you consider it's a civil union, not a religious one. it's like segregation - separate but equal. they're asking for the same rights and recognition as straight couples.\n\npeople worry about things like adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. they're concerned about how gay couples will be perceived by society, and whether or not their children will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. but this is a new issue, and it's hard to say for sure. the main concern is how children of gay parents will be treated by their peers and other adults. in places like new york city, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied and harassed in public schools. this is just cruel.\n\nresearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of parenting as straight couples. it's really just a matter of personal choice, not sexual orientation. the federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. the amendment against it is just a form of hypocrisy, considering the controversy over the pledge of allegiance and government enforcing religious standards on the country.\n\nsome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is just not true. the american psychological association has debunked this claim, and people should be listening to research and studies, not just popular opinion and their neighbors' views. if we listened to experts, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I'm still working at the hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I had some thoughts on this topic. Just because a particular substance is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have potential benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the general public, no way, not at all. However, if we can use it for medicinal purposes, then I think that's a different story.\n\nThe thing is, some medications that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are still used in pharmacies because they're beneficial, despite their illegitimate status. If we dismiss marijuana's benefits just because there's a stigma surrounding it, that's just pointless. I think we should give its potential benefits some consideration.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is comparable to alcohol, though. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, whereas excessive alcohol consumption can have even worse consequences. Integrating marijuana into society in a controlled manner might be a viable option, but it would require some adjustments. We need to address the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople tend to have a negative perception of marijuana because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as hazardous as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might use it more responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone some significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's a lot less strict than it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was a routine I followed, even when I was at private school, where I'd see my friends on weekends. But things have changed, and the church has introduced a more laid-back atmosphere. They've even created a \"teenager mass\" that's only 30 minutes long, which has made things more casual. People now show up in their beach clothes during the summer, and even families who are running late are welcome. The morning masses, where I used to dress up, are now more relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. It's definitely a more casual vibe.\n\nTo be honest, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I'm not too familiar with the church's inner workings, but that's my observation. \n\nRegarding the recent accusations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and it's their personal choice to act on their attraction to young kids. It's not about their marital status; it's about the individual's character. I also believe that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nSome religions allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh-Day Adventists, and their reverends or ministers are still expected to adhere to their faith. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different denomination. \n\nTo elaborate, I think the key factor in pedophilia is genetics, rather than upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some factors might contribute, I believe people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed through marriage or any other means. The church, in this case, couldn't have done much to prevent these incidents, especially if they were not aware of the situations. If they were aware and chose to cover it up, that's a different story.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have much to add.",
            "I have to say, I initially found the idea [insert premise] somewhat acceptable, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and it seemed like we went into Iraq under the guise of a pretext. I believe the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really ruffled my feathers, and the Iraq war has become a contentious issue for me. It seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave a key presentation at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is a serious breach of trust and raises questions about accountability.\n\nIt's become clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the Constitution and has been working to undermine it since at least 9/11. I believe they came into office with the intention of going to war, and their actions suggest that they were motivated by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein. The younger Bush may have had a personal score to settle with Saddam, possibly due to his father's administration, and may have been hoping to expand our energy supplies.\n\nI think it's time for the war to end, but I'm concerned that withdrawal would lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative appears to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order. However, I'm skeptical about this approach, as it may create more problems in the long run, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to exert control, with radical elements vying for power.\n\nI'm not sure I have a solution that I can articulate in polite company, but I'm certainly vocal about my skepticism regarding the war and its aftermath.",
            "I haven't posted in a while, so I wanted to weigh in on the War in Iraq. To be honest, I'm not sure how to articulate my views because I don't really follow the intricacies of the conflict. From what I've gathered, it seems like we're still there more or less out of a desire to establish a democratic government, similar to our own, and to secure access to their oil reserves. However, this endeavor has been met with widespread discontent. The problem is, if we stay, we risk facing a prolonged and difficult process of nation-building, only to potentially leave behind a power vacuum that could lead to further conflict. On the other hand, if we withdraw, the people of Iraq will likely be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, which could also lead to resentment towards the US. At this point, I'm struggling to see a clear-cut solution.\n\nTo be blunt, I think it's time to reevaluate our involvement in the conflict. Let's be honest, the US didn't declare a formal war, so it's hard to justify the ongoing occupation. And even if we did, I'm not convinced that our presence is doing more good than harm. The resources we're expending could be better spent elsewhere, and the situation is causing President Bush a lot of grief. I'm reminded of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared conflict that's now widely regarded as a meaningless war. If history repeats itself, Bush risks being remembered as the president who initiated a similarly fruitless conflict.\n\nIt's also worth considering the human cost. There are families I know who have loved ones serving in Iraq, and it's hard to reconcile the desire to support them with the knowledge that our continued presence is causing them harm. However, I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be attempting to impose our own values and way of life on the Iraqi people, which could lead to even more resentment and division. The Al-Qaeda threat is also a concern, as our presence may only serve to fuel their hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight. That's my take on the situation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not thrilled about this, but it doesn't feel right for a state to make it legal. In my opinion, it's more the churches' decision, given the constitution's separation of church and state clause. It's quite clear in there, and I think trying to impose power over it would be a direct defiance of what's been established. \n\nThose pushing for it to be made illegal seem to be choosing one church's beliefs over another, especially considering most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't dictate as law.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even proposing an amendment on this seems wrong, as it goes against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why they're pushing for this amendment, other than it aligns with the president's own Catholic beliefs. This just shows a preference for one religion over others, which isn't right. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There's no real reason behind the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've made my point clear, so I'll stop there.",
            "Well, let's get to the point - I'm still trying to wrap my head around the war in Iraq. I think the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. It seemed like they tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but that was a bit of a stretch. Emotions were high after 9/11, and the government played on that to justify the war. \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of war, especially pre-emptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from those experiences. The number of American soldiers who have died is staggering, and it's heartbreaking. Removing a country's government without being prepared for the aftermath can lead to chaos and power vacuums, which is exactly what happened in Iraq.\n\nThe US government was trying to implant a democratic government, but that's a long and difficult process. It's not something that can be achieved overnight, and it's not as simple as pushing out one government and replacing it with another. The US should have known that the road to democracy in Iraq would be long and hard, but they seemed to downplay that. \n\nI think the government was not adequately prepared for the insurgency that arose, and that's a major reason why we're still in Iraq today. It's not a clear-cut victory like they initially thought it would be. Fighting an insurgency is tough, especially when you're fighting the very citizens of the country. It's a difficult situation, and I think the government underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nIf the government was going to go to war, they should have planned for all possible outcomes. They didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there. Many American troops have died, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to secure their own country. It's a long and difficult process, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be easy.\n\nThe reason we're in Iraq is a complex one, but I think it's largely about oil and controlling resources. The initial reason for the invasion was to find weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had those types of weapons, haven't faced the same level of aggression. It's a bit hypocritical, and I think the US government isn't being honest about its motivations.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. Unfortunately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.",
            "Honestly, I think I'm pretty clear on where I stand when it comes to gay marriage. I've always been a supporter, and I believe it's a matter of personal preference. Research has shown that homosexuality may have a biological basis, rather than being solely a product of upbringing, so it's unfair to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI think it's inhumane to treat people differently based on their sexual orientation, especially when it's not something they can change. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government should stay out of it – it's a personal issue, not a political one. Even at the state level, marriage is often seen as a personal choice, not a matter for the government to dictate.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who lead regular lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks, go about their daily business, and don't deserve to be treated any differently. I find it ridiculous that the current administration is trying to impose its own interpretation of what marriage should be.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing. This is a biological factor, not a social one, and it's unfair to penalize people for something they can't control.\n\nOne of the main issues I have is that marriage is a private matter, but only straight couples seem to have that privilege. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly in a place like Las Vegas, but if a gay couple wants to make the same commitment, it's splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think that's a double standard that needs to be addressed.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a personal, private choice, rather than a matter of public debate and government intervention.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure where to start, but I'll try to clarify something here. When you post something online, it becomes a public forum, completely open to everyone's view. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this issue in the past. You see, once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, it's only a matter of time before someone takes notice. You can't control what people think or say when they see that content online, and it's not like you can retract it either.\n\nThe internet is a public space, visible to anyone, and if your friends have you connected on platforms like Myspace, they'll likely see whatever you post. It's not the school that's accessing that information, but rather someone who's brought it to their attention. Since they can't just ignore it, they have to take action to prevent any potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just a joke, but that's why it's essential to be mindful of what you post online.\n\nWhat happened at our school was a great example of this. Someone overheard something that sounded alarming, and when we investigated, we found out it was just a misinterpreted joke. However, in the heat of the moment, it became a serious concern. When you post something online, you're essentially waiving your right to privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to form an opinion about you, don't share your thoughts online.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friending their students on social media platforms or snooping around their online activities. That's just not right. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. We shouldn't be monitoring private conversations or texts, but if it's brought to our attention, we have to address it. A good rule of thumb is to avoid creating fake online accounts or friending students under different names – that's just not a good idea.\n\nAs an RA, I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially when they post about it online. I'd rather not have that level of connection with them. It's not my place to know, and it's not my responsibility to police their behavior. That's just not what I signed up for.",
            "i'm getting the feeling that this war has dragged on for far too long. \noriginally, the goal was commendable - to bring democracy to a country in need of it. \nbut it's clear we've strayed from that purpose a long time ago. \nnow, it seems like we're fighting just to prove a point, to show off our military might. \ni'm not so sure about the motivations behind this war from the start, especially considering george bush's senior's past issues with saddam hussein. \nif the goal was to introduce democracy to a country with a flawed political system, that would be a valid reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. \nin my opinion, it's been a drawn-out conflict \ni think we made our point in the first few months, simply by starting the war - it was a statement in itself. \nbut the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year, maybe even years, just seems like a waste of time. \nif we were genuinely trying to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. \nhowever, over time, our reasons for fighting seem to have been lost and misconstrued. \nit appears we're still at war, simply because we don't want to stop fighting. \ni think it's time to bring this to an end, for the sake of our own economy and resources. \nwe've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, while neglecting our own internal issues, like poverty and underfunding for essential services like education and healthcare. \ni believe we should be spending our money on domestic problems, rather than a war that's lost its purpose. \nultimately, it's time for the government of the country we're involved in to take responsibility for themselves, and for us to focus on our own problems at home.",
            "I was wondering if I could clarify something. It seems that someone was able to access information online that ended up preventing a potentially serious situation. \n\nTo be honest, if you're posting information on the internet, it's generally fair game for anyone to see. On platforms like Myspace, for instance, you have to grant access to your profile by adding someone as a friend. When you do that, you're essentially giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it's safe to say that if someone stumbles upon your online presence, you should be aware that many people will see what you've posted. It's just the way the internet works. In this particular case, I actually think it's good that someone was able to prevent a potential issue.\n\nHowever, it does raise some complex questions. On one hand, it's not feasible to have someone constantly monitoring every student's online activity to prevent problems. But on the other hand, if they're focusing on specific individuals, it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is, but it seems like it would depend on the specific circumstances. Was the person simply browsing randomly, or were they actively searching for something? If it's the latter, it's a bit more understandable.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook and I'm aware of the potential risks. There are people out there who can access a lot of information about me, and I've seen cases where people have been able to gather info quickly. It's a bit unnerving, to say the least.\n\nI do try to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. You never really know who might be viewing your online activity.\n\nI did hear a story about a high school that banned students from having Myspace accounts. To be honest, I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to make that decision. It's a bit of a gray area when it comes to online privacy.",
            "I'm not sure if I'm going to get into this, but I guess I have to mention the Iraq War one more time. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, but I'll try to get it out. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The fact is, pretty much everyone, including the administration, now agrees that the war was a bad idea - except they don't want to admit they made a mistake. It's clear from recent polls that the overwhelming majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis, U.S. troops, and even global citizens, think the war was a bad idea. In fact, a staggering 75 to 80 percent of people worldwide, 80 percent of Iraqis, and 70 percent of U.S. troops in Iraq believe we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's been a complete disaster from the very beginning, and now it seems like pulling out will also be a challenge. The Middle East is just too complex, with a huge cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states. It's simply unrealistic to think we can impose democracy in an area where it's not necessarily wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. I just don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq; the administration's ideas on why it's better to stay seem flawed, and I haven't seen a legitimate reason to stay longer.\n\nIf we want to leave gradually over the course of a year or more, I wouldn't have a huge problem with that. However, I just don't see why we can't leave now. A recent statistic I came across showed that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with at least a quarter wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and it's hard to ignore their wishes. If we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our decision if things go badly. If we decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as trying to do the right thing, even if we're not entirely successful.",
            "I wanted to share my thoughts on the issue of gender discrimination in the United States. To be honest, I think it's still a big problem. Not just for women, but also in certain fields of work. The thing is, even though we're supposed to be equal, many people still struggle to find opportunities to work under a woman, simply because of how society has been conditioned over the years. \n\nIn the workplace, women often have the skills and qualifications for a particular job, but they might not get promoted because of the way things have always been done. It's not just about women, though; men can face similar issues in industries like fashion or when taking time off to care for their families. People tend to look down on men who choose to stay at home and raise their kids, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be tough on them, especially if they've always wanted to be involved in their children's lives.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where men can face discrimination. If a man is passionate about fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume it's a female-dominated field. This is partly because men who are into fashion are often seen as not being like other guys. It's hard to understand how they can truly relate to women's fashion when they have a different style of life.\n\nIn my opinion, gender discrimination is a problem in various fields, and it's not easy to change. Society has a set mindset that's hard to shift, but we're making progress. We've seen women breaking into leadership roles and becoming CEOs, and it's slowly becoming more accepted. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted, as people realize that women's careers can be just as valuable.\n\nTo promote change, I think we need to highlight the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be pushy or forceful, but rather showcase their strengths in a way that resonates with people. If we try to change too quickly, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now, where we're starting to make progress without pushing too hard. It's all about finding that balance and letting things unfold naturally.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, education, or even their grammar, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might face prejudice because of their regional accent or lack of formal education, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Similarly, men can be discriminated against by other men based on their background or education level.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that gender discrimination is a complex issue that affects people in different ways, and it's not just about women. We need to recognize this and work together to create a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "Well, I think people misunderstand the concept. They're not advocating for full legalization, but rather decriminalization. This essentially changes the penalty from a serious crime to a minor infraction, much like a traffic ticket. You'd get a citation rather than being arrested and taken in. This is a significant difference, especially for those who worry about future consequences, such as job interviews and the like. These repercussions might not entirely disappear with decriminalization, but they're certainly reduced.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and prosecute people for minor offenses. It's costly to involve the court system, appoint public defenders, and pay judges and prosecutors. This can be a heavy burden for municipalities that are already struggling financially. Some communities might be philosophically opposed to decriminalization, even if it would free up funds for other essential services like public education, social programs for seniors, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, in cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization is seen as a positive step. It's freed up resources that can be redirected to more pressing issues. The financial aspect is just one factor; there are other reasons to approach this issue carefully. If marijuana were fully legalized, it could become as ubiquitous as cigarettes, and that's a concern for many people. Some worry about people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many circles.\n\nWhile marijuana might have a different impact on people's lives compared to alcohol, both substances have their negative effects. It's challenging to generalize how individuals react to substances, as people's responses vary greatly. Some can handle it moderately, while others might struggle. Nonetheless, I believe both substances have their drawbacks, and it's essential to approach this issue with caution.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with you because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition. They've maintained certain rituals and practices for a long time, which can be beneficial in providing a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally important to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel obligated to attend church every week and adhere to strict rules regarding their practices. Unfortunately, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church looks down on people who don't conform to their doctrine, and it can be exclusionary towards those who aren't perfect Catholics or those of other faiths. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's ironic that the Catholic faith teaches love and acceptance, but their practices often contradict this. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily solve the issue of pedophilia, though. Those who engage in such behavior tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship, after all, and I'm not convinced that allowing priests to be married would significantly impact this problem.\n\nIn any case, I don't think it would be a solution to the issue at hand. People who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, so this aspect of the debate doesn't seem to be a crucial factor.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to form an opinion on this topic. To be frank, I'm not convinced that either side has the upper hand here. I think this is one of the most complex issues we're dealing with at the moment. On one hand, we have the delicate balance between church and state, and on the other, the definition of marriage is a minefield.\n\nTo be honest, I'm undecided on whether marriage should be viewed through a government lens. After all, many people consider it a sacrament, and that's not something the government should meddle with. If two people get married, they should be treated as any other couple, regardless of whether they've been baptized or not. They should be seen as a civil union, plain and simple.\n\nMy point is that we shouldn't be separating church and state on this issue. It's not about whether the marriage was, say, a Christian or secular one; it's about two people coming together. And if we're talking about gay marriage, it's really just about two people entering into a civil union.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it should be pushed to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous. It's a huge issue for some people, but it's not something that warrants amending the constitution.\n\nIt's not a big enough deal to warrant altering the constitution, let alone defining or banning gay marriage. Period.\n\nFrankly, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has made homosexuality a bit of a complex issue for me. I have close gay friends, and while I have my reservations about their lifestyle choices, I believe it's essential to support their rights. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be legalized. However, I don't think it should be a federal issue; rather, it should be left up to individual states to decide.\n\nI understand that many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, and as a result, their views on gay marriage may differ. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, I don't think you should necessarily disagree with the decision, considering you chose to reside there. I believe everyone should be entitled to the same opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered this point, but I don't believe it's right for President Bush to impose his views on the entire country, dictating that gay marriage should be banned nationwide. I think it's up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I disagree with his stance on the matter.\n\nTo be frank, I think it's unfair for the President to decide how every state should govern itself. He doesn't live in every state, so how can he possibly understand the unique needs and values of each community? Some issues should be left to the states to decide, and the President's ban on gay marriage is one of them. Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and his successor could potentially reverse his decision. It's just common sense to let individual states handle this issue, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences of their decisions.\n\nI don't think so.",
            "I guess I'm a bit hesitant to post this, but I wanted to share my thoughts on a rather delicate topic. Essentially, when you post something online, like on a public platform like Myspace, you have to accept that it's out there for anyone to see - not just school officials, but pretty much anyone with an internet connection. \n\nAs I see it, school officials have every right to see what students are posting online, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school. With the internet, it's not like they'd need to be under the school's name to access it; they could easily check it from home. Given the importance of school safety, I think it's perfectly fine for officials to monitor students' online activity if it helps prevent potential threats, such as a school shooting. \n\nIn fact, if school officials are going on Myspace just to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, I think that's a bit too invasive. However, if their goal is to maintain a safer school environment, I don't see that as an issue. It's a trade-off between personal freedom and school responsibility, and in this case, I think the school's responsibility to keep students safe takes precedence.\n\nOne of the main issues is that anything you post online is essentially permanent, and it can come back to haunt you. Even if you're not doing anything malicious, there's always a risk that someone will stumble upon something you posted, and it could lead to trouble. That's why I'm cautious about posting anything potentially sensitive, even in private emails. \n\nIt's a bit paradoxical, but if you do something questionable in college, it can come back to haunt you later in life. Once something's online, it's out there forever, and there's no taking it back. So, in my opinion, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nIn this particular case, I think the school officials were justified in monitoring students' Myspace activity to prevent potential threats. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safer school environment. I've had this conversation with a teacher before, and they mentioned that schools have to be proactive in ensuring student safety, like conducting lockdown drills to prepare for emergencies. It's not that far-fetched to think that monitoring online activity could be part of that.\n\nUltimately, I think it's a delicate balance between personal freedom and school responsibility. If school officials have a legitimate reason to monitor online activity, like preventing school shootings, then I don't see that as an invasion of privacy. It's all about prioritizing student safety.",
            "Honestly, I haven't been able to articulate my thoughts on the war lately because I've been trying to process the initial emotions that led to our involvement. At first, I was all for going over there, especially since September 11th affected me personally. I thought we should take a strong stance and show them the same kind of chaos they inflicted upon us. However, as I looked deeper, I realized we weren't prepared for the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into it without a clear plan, and that's when things started to unravel.\n\nI now find myself strongly opposed to the war. I don't think it's achieved anything significant, and I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on making progress. As long as they're at odds with themselves, it's hard to see how our presence would make a difference. Unfortunately, the trauma of September 11th has left me with a sense of detachment towards the situation. I struggle to care about the conflicts over there, and it's hard for me to see them as human beings when they're so consumed by violence.\n\nThe biggest issue is that war is a foreign concept to them, and their approach is far more brutal than ours. I don't think they're seeking to improve their country; instead, they're focused on getting rid of us. I think it's time for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were driven by a desire for revenge and a lack of rational thinking about the potential consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq seemed like a knee-jerk reaction, and I'm not convinced it was the right call.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we should have had a clearer plan and a more united front. Without that, we've only created more chaos. I don't think we're equipped to change the people of Iraq; they'll continue to be the way they are, and our presence only serves to prolong the conflicts. I genuinely believe we're not making enough progress, and no matter how long we stay, it'll eventually collapse once we leave. I think our presence is self-damaging, and it's time for us to reassess our strategy."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to reassess its stance on several issues. Many people have been discussing the decline in the Church's following, and I believe it's because the Church is often not very accepting of various things.\n\nFor instance, their views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control are quite rigid, which is understandable, but also somewhat outdated. If the Church were to be more open to modern perspectives, it wouldn't lose its followers. Instead, people are starting to turn against the Church's stance on these issues and view them as outdated.\n\nSome individuals are even choosing not to follow the Church because of its views on topics like abortion and gay marriage. The Church's stance against abortion means that those who support it might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. Similarly, those who believe in and want to practice gay marriage might not feel at home in a community that doesn't support it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented the Church's problems entirely. Perhaps allowing priests to be married or having female priests might have changed things, but it's hard to say for certain.\n\nThe idea that priests can't be married because they're \"married to God\" doesn't sit well with me. Everyone else in the world has a job and a personal life, so why can't priests have both? It's a bit illogical to expect them to dedicate their entire lives to the Church without any personal relationships.",
            "I haven't really been able to articulate my thoughts on the issue of gay marriage, but I wanted to take a moment to share my perspective. To be clear, I don't have any issue with gay marriage in general. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose, but rather something they're born with. So, I don't think it's fair to hold them accountable for it. It seems to me that it's not a matter of personal choice, but rather a fundamental aspect of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, I do believe it's unjust to deny gay couples the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation. It's not like they've made a conscious decision to be gay; they're just being themselves. I think it's essential to recognize and respect that.\n\nIn my view, the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral concerns. It's simply a personal matter that doesn't affect anyone else. I think it's unfair for the government to interfere in people's private lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as their relationships and identities. Let's face it, people are born gay, and they shouldn't be punished for being themselves.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "i think that gay marriage should be legalized. here's why: there's just no good reason not to. people often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's really not the same thing. it's like comparing apples and oranges - two different sides of the same coin. you can't have heads without tails, and the same goes for these relationships. they're just as valid, with their own set of civil rights, like property taxes and healthcare benefits. for example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital because they're not considered family, which is pretty silly considering you're planning to spend the rest of your life together. research has shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as straight couples do.\n\nthe issue is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church - they're asking for a legal marriage certificate from the government. this should be a no-brainer, especially if you consider it's a civil union, not a religious one. it's like segregation - separate but equal. they're asking for the same rights and recognition as straight couples.\n\npeople worry about things like adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. they're concerned about how gay couples will be perceived by society, and whether or not their children will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. but this is a new issue, and it's hard to say for sure. the main concern is how children of gay parents will be treated by their peers and other adults. in places like new york city, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied and harassed in public schools. this is just cruel.\n\nresearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of parenting as straight couples. it's really just a matter of personal choice, not sexual orientation. the federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. the amendment against it is just a form of hypocrisy, considering the controversy over the pledge of allegiance and government enforcing religious standards on the country.\n\nsome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is just not true. the american psychological association has debunked this claim, and people should be listening to research and studies, not just popular opinion and their neighbors' views. if we listened to experts, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I'm still working at the hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I had some thoughts on this topic. Just because a particular substance is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have potential benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the general public, no way, not at all. However, if we can use it for medicinal purposes, then I think that's a different story.\n\nThe thing is, some medications that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are still used in pharmacies because they're beneficial, despite their illegitimate status. If we dismiss marijuana's benefits just because there's a stigma surrounding it, that's just pointless. I think we should give its potential benefits some consideration.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is comparable to alcohol, though. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, whereas excessive alcohol consumption can have even worse consequences. Integrating marijuana into society in a controlled manner might be a viable option, but it would require some adjustments. We need to address the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople tend to have a negative perception of marijuana because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as hazardous as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might use it more responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone some significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's a lot less strict than it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was a routine I followed, even when I was at private school, where I'd see my friends on weekends. But things have changed, and the church has introduced a more laid-back atmosphere. They've even created a \"teenager mass\" that's only 30 minutes long, which has made things more casual. People now show up in their beach clothes during the summer, and even families who are running late are welcome. The morning masses, where I used to dress up, are now more relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. It's definitely a more casual vibe.\n\nTo be honest, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I'm not too familiar with the church's inner workings, but that's my observation. \n\nRegarding the recent accusations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and it's their personal choice to act on their attraction to young kids. It's not about their marital status; it's about the individual's character. I also believe that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nSome religions allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh-Day Adventists, and their reverends or ministers are still expected to adhere to their faith. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different denomination. \n\nTo elaborate, I think the key factor in pedophilia is genetics, rather than upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some factors might contribute, I believe people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed through marriage or any other means. The church, in this case, couldn't have done much to prevent these incidents, especially if they were not aware of the situations. If they were aware and chose to cover it up, that's a different story.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have much to add.",
            "I have to say, I initially found the idea [insert premise] somewhat acceptable, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and it seemed like we went into Iraq under the guise of a pretext. I believe the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really ruffled my feathers, and the Iraq war has become a contentious issue for me. It seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave a key presentation at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is a serious breach of trust and raises questions about accountability.\n\nIt's become clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the Constitution and has been working to undermine it since at least 9/11. I believe they came into office with the intention of going to war, and their actions suggest that they were motivated by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein. The younger Bush may have had a personal score to settle with Saddam, possibly due to his father's administration, and may have been hoping to expand our energy supplies.\n\nI think it's time for the war to end, but I'm concerned that withdrawal would lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative appears to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order. However, I'm skeptical about this approach, as it may create more problems in the long run, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to exert control, with radical elements vying for power.\n\nI'm not sure I have a solution that I can articulate in polite company, but I'm certainly vocal about my skepticism regarding the war and its aftermath.",
            "I haven't posted in a while, so I wanted to weigh in on the War in Iraq. To be honest, I'm not sure how to articulate my views because I don't really follow the intricacies of the conflict. From what I've gathered, it seems like we're still there more or less out of a desire to establish a democratic government, similar to our own, and to secure access to their oil reserves. However, this endeavor has been met with widespread discontent. The problem is, if we stay, we risk facing a prolonged and difficult process of nation-building, only to potentially leave behind a power vacuum that could lead to further conflict. On the other hand, if we withdraw, the people of Iraq will likely be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, which could also lead to resentment towards the US. At this point, I'm struggling to see a clear-cut solution.\n\nTo be blunt, I think it's time to reevaluate our involvement in the conflict. Let's be honest, the US didn't declare a formal war, so it's hard to justify the ongoing occupation. And even if we did, I'm not convinced that our presence is doing more good than harm. The resources we're expending could be better spent elsewhere, and the situation is causing President Bush a lot of grief. I'm reminded of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared conflict that's now widely regarded as a meaningless war. If history repeats itself, Bush risks being remembered as the president who initiated a similarly fruitless conflict.\n\nIt's also worth considering the human cost. There are families I know who have loved ones serving in Iraq, and it's hard to reconcile the desire to support them with the knowledge that our continued presence is causing them harm. However, I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be attempting to impose our own values and way of life on the Iraqi people, which could lead to even more resentment and division. The Al-Qaeda threat is also a concern, as our presence may only serve to fuel their hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight. That's my take on the situation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not thrilled about this, but it doesn't feel right for a state to make it legal. In my opinion, it's more the churches' decision, given the constitution's separation of church and state clause. It's quite clear in there, and I think trying to impose power over it would be a direct defiance of what's been established. \n\nThose pushing for it to be made illegal seem to be choosing one church's beliefs over another, especially considering most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't dictate as law.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even proposing an amendment on this seems wrong, as it goes against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why they're pushing for this amendment, other than it aligns with the president's own Catholic beliefs. This just shows a preference for one religion over others, which isn't right. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There's no real reason behind the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've made my point clear, so I'll stop there.",
            "Well, let's get to the point - I'm still trying to wrap my head around the war in Iraq. I think the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. It seemed like they tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but that was a bit of a stretch. Emotions were high after 9/11, and the government played on that to justify the war. \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of war, especially pre-emptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from those experiences. The number of American soldiers who have died is staggering, and it's heartbreaking. Removing a country's government without being prepared for the aftermath can lead to chaos and power vacuums, which is exactly what happened in Iraq.\n\nThe US government was trying to implant a democratic government, but that's a long and difficult process. It's not something that can be achieved overnight, and it's not as simple as pushing out one government and replacing it with another. The US should have known that the road to democracy in Iraq would be long and hard, but they seemed to downplay that. \n\nI think the government was not adequately prepared for the insurgency that arose, and that's a major reason why we're still in Iraq today. It's not a clear-cut victory like they initially thought it would be. Fighting an insurgency is tough, especially when you're fighting the very citizens of the country. It's a difficult situation, and I think the government underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nIf the government was going to go to war, they should have planned for all possible outcomes. They didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there. Many American troops have died, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to secure their own country. It's a long and difficult process, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be easy.\n\nThe reason we're in Iraq is a complex one, but I think it's largely about oil and controlling resources. The initial reason for the invasion was to find weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had those types of weapons, haven't faced the same level of aggression. It's a bit hypocritical, and I think the US government isn't being honest about its motivations.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. Unfortunately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.",
            "Honestly, I think I'm pretty clear on where I stand when it comes to gay marriage. I've always been a supporter, and I believe it's a matter of personal preference. Research has shown that homosexuality may have a biological basis, rather than being solely a product of upbringing, so it's unfair to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI think it's inhumane to treat people differently based on their sexual orientation, especially when it's not something they can change. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government should stay out of it – it's a personal issue, not a political one. Even at the state level, marriage is often seen as a personal choice, not a matter for the government to dictate.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who lead regular lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks, go about their daily business, and don't deserve to be treated any differently. I find it ridiculous that the current administration is trying to impose its own interpretation of what marriage should be.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing. This is a biological factor, not a social one, and it's unfair to penalize people for something they can't control.\n\nOne of the main issues I have is that marriage is a private matter, but only straight couples seem to have that privilege. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly in a place like Las Vegas, but if a gay couple wants to make the same commitment, it's splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think that's a double standard that needs to be addressed.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a personal, private choice, rather than a matter of public debate and government intervention.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure where to start, but I'll try to clarify something here. When you post something online, it becomes a public forum, completely open to everyone's view. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this issue in the past. You see, once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, it's only a matter of time before someone takes notice. You can't control what people think or say when they see that content online, and it's not like you can retract it either.\n\nThe internet is a public space, visible to anyone, and if your friends have you connected on platforms like Myspace, they'll likely see whatever you post. It's not the school that's accessing that information, but rather someone who's brought it to their attention. Since they can't just ignore it, they have to take action to prevent any potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just a joke, but that's why it's essential to be mindful of what you post online.\n\nWhat happened at our school was a great example of this. Someone overheard something that sounded alarming, and when we investigated, we found out it was just a misinterpreted joke. However, in the heat of the moment, it became a serious concern. When you post something online, you're essentially waiving your right to privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to form an opinion about you, don't share your thoughts online.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friending their students on social media platforms or snooping around their online activities. That's just not right. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. We shouldn't be monitoring private conversations or texts, but if it's brought to our attention, we have to address it. A good rule of thumb is to avoid creating fake online accounts or friending students under different names – that's just not a good idea.\n\nAs an RA, I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially when they post about it online. I'd rather not have that level of connection with them. It's not my place to know, and it's not my responsibility to police their behavior. That's just not what I signed up for.",
            "i'm getting the feeling that this war has dragged on for far too long. \noriginally, the goal was commendable - to bring democracy to a country in need of it. \nbut it's clear we've strayed from that purpose a long time ago. \nnow, it seems like we're fighting just to prove a point, to show off our military might. \ni'm not so sure about the motivations behind this war from the start, especially considering george bush's senior's past issues with saddam hussein. \nif the goal was to introduce democracy to a country with a flawed political system, that would be a valid reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. \nin my opinion, it's been a drawn-out conflict \ni think we made our point in the first few months, simply by starting the war - it was a statement in itself. \nbut the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year, maybe even years, just seems like a waste of time. \nif we were genuinely trying to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. \nhowever, over time, our reasons for fighting seem to have been lost and misconstrued. \nit appears we're still at war, simply because we don't want to stop fighting. \ni think it's time to bring this to an end, for the sake of our own economy and resources. \nwe've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, while neglecting our own internal issues, like poverty and underfunding for essential services like education and healthcare. \ni believe we should be spending our money on domestic problems, rather than a war that's lost its purpose. \nultimately, it's time for the government of the country we're involved in to take responsibility for themselves, and for us to focus on our own problems at home.",
            "I was wondering if I could clarify something. It seems that someone was able to access information online that ended up preventing a potentially serious situation. \n\nTo be honest, if you're posting information on the internet, it's generally fair game for anyone to see. On platforms like Myspace, for instance, you have to grant access to your profile by adding someone as a friend. When you do that, you're essentially giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it's safe to say that if someone stumbles upon your online presence, you should be aware that many people will see what you've posted. It's just the way the internet works. In this particular case, I actually think it's good that someone was able to prevent a potential issue.\n\nHowever, it does raise some complex questions. On one hand, it's not feasible to have someone constantly monitoring every student's online activity to prevent problems. But on the other hand, if they're focusing on specific individuals, it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is, but it seems like it would depend on the specific circumstances. Was the person simply browsing randomly, or were they actively searching for something? If it's the latter, it's a bit more understandable.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook and I'm aware of the potential risks. There are people out there who can access a lot of information about me, and I've seen cases where people have been able to gather info quickly. It's a bit unnerving, to say the least.\n\nI do try to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. You never really know who might be viewing your online activity.\n\nI did hear a story about a high school that banned students from having Myspace accounts. To be honest, I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to make that decision. It's a bit of a gray area when it comes to online privacy.",
            "I'm not sure if I'm going to get into this, but I guess I have to mention the Iraq War one more time. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, but I'll try to get it out. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The fact is, pretty much everyone, including the administration, now agrees that the war was a bad idea - except they don't want to admit they made a mistake. It's clear from recent polls that the overwhelming majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis, U.S. troops, and even global citizens, think the war was a bad idea. In fact, a staggering 75 to 80 percent of people worldwide, 80 percent of Iraqis, and 70 percent of U.S. troops in Iraq believe we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's been a complete disaster from the very beginning, and now it seems like pulling out will also be a challenge. The Middle East is just too complex, with a huge cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states. It's simply unrealistic to think we can impose democracy in an area where it's not necessarily wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. I just don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq; the administration's ideas on why it's better to stay seem flawed, and I haven't seen a legitimate reason to stay longer.\n\nIf we want to leave gradually over the course of a year or more, I wouldn't have a huge problem with that. However, I just don't see why we can't leave now. A recent statistic I came across showed that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with at least a quarter wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and it's hard to ignore their wishes. If we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our decision if things go badly. If we decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as trying to do the right thing, even if we're not entirely successful.",
            "I wanted to share my thoughts on the issue of gender discrimination in the United States. To be honest, I think it's still a big problem. Not just for women, but also in certain fields of work. The thing is, even though we're supposed to be equal, many people still struggle to find opportunities to work under a woman, simply because of how society has been conditioned over the years. \n\nIn the workplace, women often have the skills and qualifications for a particular job, but they might not get promoted because of the way things have always been done. It's not just about women, though; men can face similar issues in industries like fashion or when taking time off to care for their families. People tend to look down on men who choose to stay at home and raise their kids, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be tough on them, especially if they've always wanted to be involved in their children's lives.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where men can face discrimination. If a man is passionate about fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume it's a female-dominated field. This is partly because men who are into fashion are often seen as not being like other guys. It's hard to understand how they can truly relate to women's fashion when they have a different style of life.\n\nIn my opinion, gender discrimination is a problem in various fields, and it's not easy to change. Society has a set mindset that's hard to shift, but we're making progress. We've seen women breaking into leadership roles and becoming CEOs, and it's slowly becoming more accepted. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted, as people realize that women's careers can be just as valuable.\n\nTo promote change, I think we need to highlight the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be pushy or forceful, but rather showcase their strengths in a way that resonates with people. If we try to change too quickly, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now, where we're starting to make progress without pushing too hard. It's all about finding that balance and letting things unfold naturally.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, education, or even their grammar, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might face prejudice because of their regional accent or lack of formal education, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Similarly, men can be discriminated against by other men based on their background or education level.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that gender discrimination is a complex issue that affects people in different ways, and it's not just about women. We need to recognize this and work together to create a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "Well, I think people misunderstand the concept. They're not advocating for full legalization, but rather decriminalization. This essentially changes the penalty from a serious crime to a minor infraction, much like a traffic ticket. You'd get a citation rather than being arrested and taken in. This is a significant difference, especially for those who worry about future consequences, such as job interviews and the like. These repercussions might not entirely disappear with decriminalization, but they're certainly reduced.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and prosecute people for minor offenses. It's costly to involve the court system, appoint public defenders, and pay judges and prosecutors. This can be a heavy burden for municipalities that are already struggling financially. Some communities might be philosophically opposed to decriminalization, even if it would free up funds for other essential services like public education, social programs for seniors, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, in cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization is seen as a positive step. It's freed up resources that can be redirected to more pressing issues. The financial aspect is just one factor; there are other reasons to approach this issue carefully. If marijuana were fully legalized, it could become as ubiquitous as cigarettes, and that's a concern for many people. Some worry about people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many circles.\n\nWhile marijuana might have a different impact on people's lives compared to alcohol, both substances have their negative effects. It's challenging to generalize how individuals react to substances, as people's responses vary greatly. Some can handle it moderately, while others might struggle. Nonetheless, I believe both substances have their drawbacks, and it's essential to approach this issue with caution.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with you because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition. They've maintained certain rituals and practices for a long time, which can be beneficial in providing a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally important to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel obligated to attend church every week and adhere to strict rules regarding their practices. Unfortunately, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church looks down on people who don't conform to their doctrine, and it can be exclusionary towards those who aren't perfect Catholics or those of other faiths. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's ironic that the Catholic faith teaches love and acceptance, but their practices often contradict this. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily solve the issue of pedophilia, though. Those who engage in such behavior tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship, after all, and I'm not convinced that allowing priests to be married would significantly impact this problem.\n\nIn any case, I don't think it would be a solution to the issue at hand. People who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, so this aspect of the debate doesn't seem to be a crucial factor.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to form an opinion on this topic. To be frank, I'm not convinced that either side has the upper hand here. I think this is one of the most complex issues we're dealing with at the moment. On one hand, we have the delicate balance between church and state, and on the other, the definition of marriage is a minefield.\n\nTo be honest, I'm undecided on whether marriage should be viewed through a government lens. After all, many people consider it a sacrament, and that's not something the government should meddle with. If two people get married, they should be treated as any other couple, regardless of whether they've been baptized or not. They should be seen as a civil union, plain and simple.\n\nMy point is that we shouldn't be separating church and state on this issue. It's not about whether the marriage was, say, a Christian or secular one; it's about two people coming together. And if we're talking about gay marriage, it's really just about two people entering into a civil union.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it should be pushed to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous. It's a huge issue for some people, but it's not something that warrants amending the constitution.\n\nIt's not a big enough deal to warrant altering the constitution, let alone defining or banning gay marriage. Period.\n\nFrankly, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has made homosexuality a bit of a complex issue for me. I have close gay friends, and while I have my reservations about their lifestyle choices, I believe it's essential to support their rights. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be legalized. However, I don't think it should be a federal issue; rather, it should be left up to individual states to decide.\n\nI understand that many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, and as a result, their views on gay marriage may differ. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, I don't think you should necessarily disagree with the decision, considering you chose to reside there. I believe everyone should be entitled to the same opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered this point, but I don't believe it's right for President Bush to impose his views on the entire country, dictating that gay marriage should be banned nationwide. I think it's up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I disagree with his stance on the matter.\n\nTo be frank, I think it's unfair for the President to decide how every state should govern itself. He doesn't live in every state, so how can he possibly understand the unique needs and values of each community? Some issues should be left to the states to decide, and the President's ban on gay marriage is one of them. Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and his successor could potentially reverse his decision. It's just common sense to let individual states handle this issue, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences of their decisions.\n\nI don't think so.",
            "I guess I'm a bit hesitant to post this, but I wanted to share my thoughts on a rather delicate topic. Essentially, when you post something online, like on a public platform like Myspace, you have to accept that it's out there for anyone to see - not just school officials, but pretty much anyone with an internet connection. \n\nAs I see it, school officials have every right to see what students are posting online, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school. With the internet, it's not like they'd need to be under the school's name to access it; they could easily check it from home. Given the importance of school safety, I think it's perfectly fine for officials to monitor students' online activity if it helps prevent potential threats, such as a school shooting. \n\nIn fact, if school officials are going on Myspace just to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, I think that's a bit too invasive. However, if their goal is to maintain a safer school environment, I don't see that as an issue. It's a trade-off between personal freedom and school responsibility, and in this case, I think the school's responsibility to keep students safe takes precedence.\n\nOne of the main issues is that anything you post online is essentially permanent, and it can come back to haunt you. Even if you're not doing anything malicious, there's always a risk that someone will stumble upon something you posted, and it could lead to trouble. That's why I'm cautious about posting anything potentially sensitive, even in private emails. \n\nIt's a bit paradoxical, but if you do something questionable in college, it can come back to haunt you later in life. Once something's online, it's out there forever, and there's no taking it back. So, in my opinion, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nIn this particular case, I think the school officials were justified in monitoring students' Myspace activity to prevent potential threats. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safer school environment. I've had this conversation with a teacher before, and they mentioned that schools have to be proactive in ensuring student safety, like conducting lockdown drills to prepare for emergencies. It's not that far-fetched to think that monitoring online activity could be part of that.\n\nUltimately, I think it's a delicate balance between personal freedom and school responsibility. If school officials have a legitimate reason to monitor online activity, like preventing school shootings, then I don't see that as an invasion of privacy. It's all about prioritizing student safety.",
            "Honestly, I haven't been able to articulate my thoughts on the war lately because I've been trying to process the initial emotions that led to our involvement. At first, I was all for going over there, especially since September 11th affected me personally. I thought we should take a strong stance and show them the same kind of chaos they inflicted upon us. However, as I looked deeper, I realized we weren't prepared for the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into it without a clear plan, and that's when things started to unravel.\n\nI now find myself strongly opposed to the war. I don't think it's achieved anything significant, and I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on making progress. As long as they're at odds with themselves, it's hard to see how our presence would make a difference. Unfortunately, the trauma of September 11th has left me with a sense of detachment towards the situation. I struggle to care about the conflicts over there, and it's hard for me to see them as human beings when they're so consumed by violence.\n\nThe biggest issue is that war is a foreign concept to them, and their approach is far more brutal than ours. I don't think they're seeking to improve their country; instead, they're focused on getting rid of us. I think it's time for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were driven by a desire for revenge and a lack of rational thinking about the potential consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq seemed like a knee-jerk reaction, and I'm not convinced it was the right call.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we should have had a clearer plan and a more united front. Without that, we've only created more chaos. I don't think we're equipped to change the people of Iraq; they'll continue to be the way they are, and our presence only serves to prolong the conflicts. I genuinely believe we're not making enough progress, and no matter how long we stay, it'll eventually collapse once we leave. I think our presence is self-damaging, and it's time for us to reassess our strategy."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to reassess its stance on several issues. Many people have been discussing the decline in the Church's following, and I believe it's because the Church is often not very accepting of various things.\n\nFor instance, their views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control are quite rigid, which is understandable, but also somewhat outdated. If the Church were to be more open to modern perspectives, it wouldn't lose its followers. Instead, people are starting to turn against the Church's stance on these issues and view them as outdated.\n\nSome individuals are even choosing not to follow the Church because of its views on topics like abortion and gay marriage. The Church's stance against abortion means that those who support it might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. Similarly, those who believe in and want to practice gay marriage might not feel at home in a community that doesn't support it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented the Church's problems entirely. Perhaps allowing priests to be married or having female priests might have changed things, but it's hard to say for certain.\n\nThe idea that priests can't be married because they're \"married to God\" doesn't sit well with me. Everyone else in the world has a job and a personal life, so why can't priests have both? It's a bit illogical to expect them to dedicate their entire lives to the Church without any personal relationships.",
            "I haven't really been able to articulate my thoughts on the issue of gay marriage, but I wanted to take a moment to share my perspective. To be clear, I don't have any issue with gay marriage in general. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose, but rather something they're born with. So, I don't think it's fair to hold them accountable for it. It seems to me that it's not a matter of personal choice, but rather a fundamental aspect of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, I do believe it's unjust to deny gay couples the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation. It's not like they've made a conscious decision to be gay; they're just being themselves. I think it's essential to recognize and respect that.\n\nIn my view, the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral concerns. It's simply a personal matter that doesn't affect anyone else. I think it's unfair for the government to interfere in people's private lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as their relationships and identities. Let's face it, people are born gay, and they shouldn't be punished for being themselves.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "i think that gay marriage should be legalized. here's why: there's just no good reason not to. people often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's really not the same thing. it's like comparing apples and oranges - two different sides of the same coin. you can't have heads without tails, and the same goes for these relationships. they're just as valid, with their own set of civil rights, like property taxes and healthcare benefits. for example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital because they're not considered family, which is pretty silly considering you're planning to spend the rest of your life together. research has shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as straight couples do.\n\nthe issue is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church - they're asking for a legal marriage certificate from the government. this should be a no-brainer, especially if you consider it's a civil union, not a religious one. it's like segregation - separate but equal. they're asking for the same rights and recognition as straight couples.\n\npeople worry about things like adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. they're concerned about how gay couples will be perceived by society, and whether or not their children will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. but this is a new issue, and it's hard to say for sure. the main concern is how children of gay parents will be treated by their peers and other adults. in places like new york city, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied and harassed in public schools. this is just cruel.\n\nresearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of parenting as straight couples. it's really just a matter of personal choice, not sexual orientation. the federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. the amendment against it is just a form of hypocrisy, considering the controversy over the pledge of allegiance and government enforcing religious standards on the country.\n\nsome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is just not true. the american psychological association has debunked this claim, and people should be listening to research and studies, not just popular opinion and their neighbors' views. if we listened to experts, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I'm still working at the hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I had some thoughts on this topic. Just because a particular substance is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have potential benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the general public, no way, not at all. However, if we can use it for medicinal purposes, then I think that's a different story.\n\nThe thing is, some medications that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are still used in pharmacies because they're beneficial, despite their illegitimate status. If we dismiss marijuana's benefits just because there's a stigma surrounding it, that's just pointless. I think we should give its potential benefits some consideration.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is comparable to alcohol, though. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, whereas excessive alcohol consumption can have even worse consequences. Integrating marijuana into society in a controlled manner might be a viable option, but it would require some adjustments. We need to address the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople tend to have a negative perception of marijuana because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as hazardous as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might use it more responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone some significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's a lot less strict than it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was a routine I followed, even when I was at private school, where I'd see my friends on weekends. But things have changed, and the church has introduced a more laid-back atmosphere. They've even created a \"teenager mass\" that's only 30 minutes long, which has made things more casual. People now show up in their beach clothes during the summer, and even families who are running late are welcome. The morning masses, where I used to dress up, are now more relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. It's definitely a more casual vibe.\n\nTo be honest, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I'm not too familiar with the church's inner workings, but that's my observation. \n\nRegarding the recent accusations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and it's their personal choice to act on their attraction to young kids. It's not about their marital status; it's about the individual's character. I also believe that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nSome religions allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh-Day Adventists, and their reverends or ministers are still expected to adhere to their faith. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different denomination. \n\nTo elaborate, I think the key factor in pedophilia is genetics, rather than upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some factors might contribute, I believe people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed through marriage or any other means. The church, in this case, couldn't have done much to prevent these incidents, especially if they were not aware of the situations. If they were aware and chose to cover it up, that's a different story.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have much to add.",
            "I have to say, I initially found the idea [insert premise] somewhat acceptable, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and it seemed like we went into Iraq under the guise of a pretext. I believe the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really ruffled my feathers, and the Iraq war has become a contentious issue for me. It seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave a key presentation at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is a serious breach of trust and raises questions about accountability.\n\nIt's become clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the Constitution and has been working to undermine it since at least 9/11. I believe they came into office with the intention of going to war, and their actions suggest that they were motivated by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein. The younger Bush may have had a personal score to settle with Saddam, possibly due to his father's administration, and may have been hoping to expand our energy supplies.\n\nI think it's time for the war to end, but I'm concerned that withdrawal would lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative appears to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order. However, I'm skeptical about this approach, as it may create more problems in the long run, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to exert control, with radical elements vying for power.\n\nI'm not sure I have a solution that I can articulate in polite company, but I'm certainly vocal about my skepticism regarding the war and its aftermath.",
            "I haven't posted in a while, so I wanted to weigh in on the War in Iraq. To be honest, I'm not sure how to articulate my views because I don't really follow the intricacies of the conflict. From what I've gathered, it seems like we're still there more or less out of a desire to establish a democratic government, similar to our own, and to secure access to their oil reserves. However, this endeavor has been met with widespread discontent. The problem is, if we stay, we risk facing a prolonged and difficult process of nation-building, only to potentially leave behind a power vacuum that could lead to further conflict. On the other hand, if we withdraw, the people of Iraq will likely be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, which could also lead to resentment towards the US. At this point, I'm struggling to see a clear-cut solution.\n\nTo be blunt, I think it's time to reevaluate our involvement in the conflict. Let's be honest, the US didn't declare a formal war, so it's hard to justify the ongoing occupation. And even if we did, I'm not convinced that our presence is doing more good than harm. The resources we're expending could be better spent elsewhere, and the situation is causing President Bush a lot of grief. I'm reminded of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared conflict that's now widely regarded as a meaningless war. If history repeats itself, Bush risks being remembered as the president who initiated a similarly fruitless conflict.\n\nIt's also worth considering the human cost. There are families I know who have loved ones serving in Iraq, and it's hard to reconcile the desire to support them with the knowledge that our continued presence is causing them harm. However, I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be attempting to impose our own values and way of life on the Iraqi people, which could lead to even more resentment and division. The Al-Qaeda threat is also a concern, as our presence may only serve to fuel their hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight. That's my take on the situation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not thrilled about this, but it doesn't feel right for a state to make it legal. In my opinion, it's more the churches' decision, given the constitution's separation of church and state clause. It's quite clear in there, and I think trying to impose power over it would be a direct defiance of what's been established. \n\nThose pushing for it to be made illegal seem to be choosing one church's beliefs over another, especially considering most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't dictate as law.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even proposing an amendment on this seems wrong, as it goes against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why they're pushing for this amendment, other than it aligns with the president's own Catholic beliefs. This just shows a preference for one religion over others, which isn't right. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There's no real reason behind the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've made my point clear, so I'll stop there.",
            "Well, let's get to the point - I'm still trying to wrap my head around the war in Iraq. I think the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. It seemed like they tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but that was a bit of a stretch. Emotions were high after 9/11, and the government played on that to justify the war. \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of war, especially pre-emptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from those experiences. The number of American soldiers who have died is staggering, and it's heartbreaking. Removing a country's government without being prepared for the aftermath can lead to chaos and power vacuums, which is exactly what happened in Iraq.\n\nThe US government was trying to implant a democratic government, but that's a long and difficult process. It's not something that can be achieved overnight, and it's not as simple as pushing out one government and replacing it with another. The US should have known that the road to democracy in Iraq would be long and hard, but they seemed to downplay that. \n\nI think the government was not adequately prepared for the insurgency that arose, and that's a major reason why we're still in Iraq today. It's not a clear-cut victory like they initially thought it would be. Fighting an insurgency is tough, especially when you're fighting the very citizens of the country. It's a difficult situation, and I think the government underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nIf the government was going to go to war, they should have planned for all possible outcomes. They didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there. Many American troops have died, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to secure their own country. It's a long and difficult process, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be easy.\n\nThe reason we're in Iraq is a complex one, but I think it's largely about oil and controlling resources. The initial reason for the invasion was to find weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had those types of weapons, haven't faced the same level of aggression. It's a bit hypocritical, and I think the US government isn't being honest about its motivations.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. Unfortunately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.",
            "Honestly, I think I'm pretty clear on where I stand when it comes to gay marriage. I've always been a supporter, and I believe it's a matter of personal preference. Research has shown that homosexuality may have a biological basis, rather than being solely a product of upbringing, so it's unfair to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI think it's inhumane to treat people differently based on their sexual orientation, especially when it's not something they can change. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government should stay out of it – it's a personal issue, not a political one. Even at the state level, marriage is often seen as a personal choice, not a matter for the government to dictate.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who lead regular lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks, go about their daily business, and don't deserve to be treated any differently. I find it ridiculous that the current administration is trying to impose its own interpretation of what marriage should be.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing. This is a biological factor, not a social one, and it's unfair to penalize people for something they can't control.\n\nOne of the main issues I have is that marriage is a private matter, but only straight couples seem to have that privilege. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly in a place like Las Vegas, but if a gay couple wants to make the same commitment, it's splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think that's a double standard that needs to be addressed.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a personal, private choice, rather than a matter of public debate and government intervention.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure where to start, but I'll try to clarify something here. When you post something online, it becomes a public forum, completely open to everyone's view. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this issue in the past. You see, once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, it's only a matter of time before someone takes notice. You can't control what people think or say when they see that content online, and it's not like you can retract it either.\n\nThe internet is a public space, visible to anyone, and if your friends have you connected on platforms like Myspace, they'll likely see whatever you post. It's not the school that's accessing that information, but rather someone who's brought it to their attention. Since they can't just ignore it, they have to take action to prevent any potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just a joke, but that's why it's essential to be mindful of what you post online.\n\nWhat happened at our school was a great example of this. Someone overheard something that sounded alarming, and when we investigated, we found out it was just a misinterpreted joke. However, in the heat of the moment, it became a serious concern. When you post something online, you're essentially waiving your right to privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to form an opinion about you, don't share your thoughts online.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friending their students on social media platforms or snooping around their online activities. That's just not right. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. We shouldn't be monitoring private conversations or texts, but if it's brought to our attention, we have to address it. A good rule of thumb is to avoid creating fake online accounts or friending students under different names – that's just not a good idea.\n\nAs an RA, I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially when they post about it online. I'd rather not have that level of connection with them. It's not my place to know, and it's not my responsibility to police their behavior. That's just not what I signed up for.",
            "i'm getting the feeling that this war has dragged on for far too long. \noriginally, the goal was commendable - to bring democracy to a country in need of it. \nbut it's clear we've strayed from that purpose a long time ago. \nnow, it seems like we're fighting just to prove a point, to show off our military might. \ni'm not so sure about the motivations behind this war from the start, especially considering george bush's senior's past issues with saddam hussein. \nif the goal was to introduce democracy to a country with a flawed political system, that would be a valid reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. \nin my opinion, it's been a drawn-out conflict \ni think we made our point in the first few months, simply by starting the war - it was a statement in itself. \nbut the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year, maybe even years, just seems like a waste of time. \nif we were genuinely trying to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. \nhowever, over time, our reasons for fighting seem to have been lost and misconstrued. \nit appears we're still at war, simply because we don't want to stop fighting. \ni think it's time to bring this to an end, for the sake of our own economy and resources. \nwe've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, while neglecting our own internal issues, like poverty and underfunding for essential services like education and healthcare. \ni believe we should be spending our money on domestic problems, rather than a war that's lost its purpose. \nultimately, it's time for the government of the country we're involved in to take responsibility for themselves, and for us to focus on our own problems at home.",
            "I was wondering if I could clarify something. It seems that someone was able to access information online that ended up preventing a potentially serious situation. \n\nTo be honest, if you're posting information on the internet, it's generally fair game for anyone to see. On platforms like Myspace, for instance, you have to grant access to your profile by adding someone as a friend. When you do that, you're essentially giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it's safe to say that if someone stumbles upon your online presence, you should be aware that many people will see what you've posted. It's just the way the internet works. In this particular case, I actually think it's good that someone was able to prevent a potential issue.\n\nHowever, it does raise some complex questions. On one hand, it's not feasible to have someone constantly monitoring every student's online activity to prevent problems. But on the other hand, if they're focusing on specific individuals, it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is, but it seems like it would depend on the specific circumstances. Was the person simply browsing randomly, or were they actively searching for something? If it's the latter, it's a bit more understandable.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook and I'm aware of the potential risks. There are people out there who can access a lot of information about me, and I've seen cases where people have been able to gather info quickly. It's a bit unnerving, to say the least.\n\nI do try to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. You never really know who might be viewing your online activity.\n\nI did hear a story about a high school that banned students from having Myspace accounts. To be honest, I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to make that decision. It's a bit of a gray area when it comes to online privacy.",
            "I'm not sure if I'm going to get into this, but I guess I have to mention the Iraq War one more time. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, but I'll try to get it out. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The fact is, pretty much everyone, including the administration, now agrees that the war was a bad idea - except they don't want to admit they made a mistake. It's clear from recent polls that the overwhelming majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis, U.S. troops, and even global citizens, think the war was a bad idea. In fact, a staggering 75 to 80 percent of people worldwide, 80 percent of Iraqis, and 70 percent of U.S. troops in Iraq believe we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's been a complete disaster from the very beginning, and now it seems like pulling out will also be a challenge. The Middle East is just too complex, with a huge cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states. It's simply unrealistic to think we can impose democracy in an area where it's not necessarily wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. I just don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq; the administration's ideas on why it's better to stay seem flawed, and I haven't seen a legitimate reason to stay longer.\n\nIf we want to leave gradually over the course of a year or more, I wouldn't have a huge problem with that. However, I just don't see why we can't leave now. A recent statistic I came across showed that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with at least a quarter wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and it's hard to ignore their wishes. If we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our decision if things go badly. If we decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as trying to do the right thing, even if we're not entirely successful.",
            "I wanted to share my thoughts on the issue of gender discrimination in the United States. To be honest, I think it's still a big problem. Not just for women, but also in certain fields of work. The thing is, even though we're supposed to be equal, many people still struggle to find opportunities to work under a woman, simply because of how society has been conditioned over the years. \n\nIn the workplace, women often have the skills and qualifications for a particular job, but they might not get promoted because of the way things have always been done. It's not just about women, though; men can face similar issues in industries like fashion or when taking time off to care for their families. People tend to look down on men who choose to stay at home and raise their kids, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be tough on them, especially if they've always wanted to be involved in their children's lives.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where men can face discrimination. If a man is passionate about fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume it's a female-dominated field. This is partly because men who are into fashion are often seen as not being like other guys. It's hard to understand how they can truly relate to women's fashion when they have a different style of life.\n\nIn my opinion, gender discrimination is a problem in various fields, and it's not easy to change. Society has a set mindset that's hard to shift, but we're making progress. We've seen women breaking into leadership roles and becoming CEOs, and it's slowly becoming more accepted. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted, as people realize that women's careers can be just as valuable.\n\nTo promote change, I think we need to highlight the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be pushy or forceful, but rather showcase their strengths in a way that resonates with people. If we try to change too quickly, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now, where we're starting to make progress without pushing too hard. It's all about finding that balance and letting things unfold naturally.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, education, or even their grammar, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might face prejudice because of their regional accent or lack of formal education, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Similarly, men can be discriminated against by other men based on their background or education level.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that gender discrimination is a complex issue that affects people in different ways, and it's not just about women. We need to recognize this and work together to create a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "Well, I think people misunderstand the concept. They're not advocating for full legalization, but rather decriminalization. This essentially changes the penalty from a serious crime to a minor infraction, much like a traffic ticket. You'd get a citation rather than being arrested and taken in. This is a significant difference, especially for those who worry about future consequences, such as job interviews and the like. These repercussions might not entirely disappear with decriminalization, but they're certainly reduced.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and prosecute people for minor offenses. It's costly to involve the court system, appoint public defenders, and pay judges and prosecutors. This can be a heavy burden for municipalities that are already struggling financially. Some communities might be philosophically opposed to decriminalization, even if it would free up funds for other essential services like public education, social programs for seniors, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, in cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization is seen as a positive step. It's freed up resources that can be redirected to more pressing issues. The financial aspect is just one factor; there are other reasons to approach this issue carefully. If marijuana were fully legalized, it could become as ubiquitous as cigarettes, and that's a concern for many people. Some worry about people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many circles.\n\nWhile marijuana might have a different impact on people's lives compared to alcohol, both substances have their negative effects. It's challenging to generalize how individuals react to substances, as people's responses vary greatly. Some can handle it moderately, while others might struggle. Nonetheless, I believe both substances have their drawbacks, and it's essential to approach this issue with caution.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with you because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition. They've maintained certain rituals and practices for a long time, which can be beneficial in providing a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally important to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel obligated to attend church every week and adhere to strict rules regarding their practices. Unfortunately, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church looks down on people who don't conform to their doctrine, and it can be exclusionary towards those who aren't perfect Catholics or those of other faiths. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's ironic that the Catholic faith teaches love and acceptance, but their practices often contradict this. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily solve the issue of pedophilia, though. Those who engage in such behavior tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship, after all, and I'm not convinced that allowing priests to be married would significantly impact this problem.\n\nIn any case, I don't think it would be a solution to the issue at hand. People who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, so this aspect of the debate doesn't seem to be a crucial factor.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to form an opinion on this topic. To be frank, I'm not convinced that either side has the upper hand here. I think this is one of the most complex issues we're dealing with at the moment. On one hand, we have the delicate balance between church and state, and on the other, the definition of marriage is a minefield.\n\nTo be honest, I'm undecided on whether marriage should be viewed through a government lens. After all, many people consider it a sacrament, and that's not something the government should meddle with. If two people get married, they should be treated as any other couple, regardless of whether they've been baptized or not. They should be seen as a civil union, plain and simple.\n\nMy point is that we shouldn't be separating church and state on this issue. It's not about whether the marriage was, say, a Christian or secular one; it's about two people coming together. And if we're talking about gay marriage, it's really just about two people entering into a civil union.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it should be pushed to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous. It's a huge issue for some people, but it's not something that warrants amending the constitution.\n\nIt's not a big enough deal to warrant altering the constitution, let alone defining or banning gay marriage. Period.\n\nFrankly, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has made homosexuality a bit of a complex issue for me. I have close gay friends, and while I have my reservations about their lifestyle choices, I believe it's essential to support their rights. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be legalized. However, I don't think it should be a federal issue; rather, it should be left up to individual states to decide.\n\nI understand that many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, and as a result, their views on gay marriage may differ. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, I don't think you should necessarily disagree with the decision, considering you chose to reside there. I believe everyone should be entitled to the same opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered this point, but I don't believe it's right for President Bush to impose his views on the entire country, dictating that gay marriage should be banned nationwide. I think it's up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I disagree with his stance on the matter.\n\nTo be frank, I think it's unfair for the President to decide how every state should govern itself. He doesn't live in every state, so how can he possibly understand the unique needs and values of each community? Some issues should be left to the states to decide, and the President's ban on gay marriage is one of them. Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and his successor could potentially reverse his decision. It's just common sense to let individual states handle this issue, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences of their decisions.\n\nI don't think so.",
            "I guess I'm a bit hesitant to post this, but I wanted to share my thoughts on a rather delicate topic. Essentially, when you post something online, like on a public platform like Myspace, you have to accept that it's out there for anyone to see - not just school officials, but pretty much anyone with an internet connection. \n\nAs I see it, school officials have every right to see what students are posting online, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school. With the internet, it's not like they'd need to be under the school's name to access it; they could easily check it from home. Given the importance of school safety, I think it's perfectly fine for officials to monitor students' online activity if it helps prevent potential threats, such as a school shooting. \n\nIn fact, if school officials are going on Myspace just to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, I think that's a bit too invasive. However, if their goal is to maintain a safer school environment, I don't see that as an issue. It's a trade-off between personal freedom and school responsibility, and in this case, I think the school's responsibility to keep students safe takes precedence.\n\nOne of the main issues is that anything you post online is essentially permanent, and it can come back to haunt you. Even if you're not doing anything malicious, there's always a risk that someone will stumble upon something you posted, and it could lead to trouble. That's why I'm cautious about posting anything potentially sensitive, even in private emails. \n\nIt's a bit paradoxical, but if you do something questionable in college, it can come back to haunt you later in life. Once something's online, it's out there forever, and there's no taking it back. So, in my opinion, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nIn this particular case, I think the school officials were justified in monitoring students' Myspace activity to prevent potential threats. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safer school environment. I've had this conversation with a teacher before, and they mentioned that schools have to be proactive in ensuring student safety, like conducting lockdown drills to prepare for emergencies. It's not that far-fetched to think that monitoring online activity could be part of that.\n\nUltimately, I think it's a delicate balance between personal freedom and school responsibility. If school officials have a legitimate reason to monitor online activity, like preventing school shootings, then I don't see that as an invasion of privacy. It's all about prioritizing student safety.",
            "Honestly, I haven't been able to articulate my thoughts on the war lately because I've been trying to process the initial emotions that led to our involvement. At first, I was all for going over there, especially since September 11th affected me personally. I thought we should take a strong stance and show them the same kind of chaos they inflicted upon us. However, as I looked deeper, I realized we weren't prepared for the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into it without a clear plan, and that's when things started to unravel.\n\nI now find myself strongly opposed to the war. I don't think it's achieved anything significant, and I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on making progress. As long as they're at odds with themselves, it's hard to see how our presence would make a difference. Unfortunately, the trauma of September 11th has left me with a sense of detachment towards the situation. I struggle to care about the conflicts over there, and it's hard for me to see them as human beings when they're so consumed by violence.\n\nThe biggest issue is that war is a foreign concept to them, and their approach is far more brutal than ours. I don't think they're seeking to improve their country; instead, they're focused on getting rid of us. I think it's time for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were driven by a desire for revenge and a lack of rational thinking about the potential consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq seemed like a knee-jerk reaction, and I'm not convinced it was the right call.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we should have had a clearer plan and a more united front. Without that, we've only created more chaos. I don't think we're equipped to change the people of Iraq; they'll continue to be the way they are, and our presence only serves to prolong the conflicts. I genuinely believe we're not making enough progress, and no matter how long we stay, it'll eventually collapse once we leave. I think our presence is self-damaging, and it's time for us to reassess our strategy."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes to stay relevant.  I think one reason people are losing interest in the Church is because it isn't very open-minded when it comes to certain issues.  They have rigid views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are outdated in many ways.  If they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, I don't think they'd be worried about losing followers. \n\nI've heard many people are turning against the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues.  People are starting to disagree with them on these topics, and that's causing some to question the Church's views.  They feel the Church is out of touch with modern values.  For example, if you support abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that sees it as morally wrong.  Similarly, if you're in favor of gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that disapproves of it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or have priests who are married.  It's not clear if that would have prevented scandals like the ones we've seen, but it's an idea worth considering.  It's hard to say whether allowing married priests or women priests would have made a difference, but it's worth exploring.  It's worth noting that other jobs involve balancing work and personal life – why can't priests do the same?\n\nThe Church views priests as married to God, devoted to a life of service.  However, most people in the world have a job and a family life, and they manage to balance both.  So, I don't see why priests can't have both a career and a family.",
            "to be honest, i'm a bit hesitant to express my thoughts on the topic of gay marriage. let me just say that personally, i don't have an issue with it - i think people should be free to live their lives however they choose. it's not something that i think is a conscious choice, and if someone is born with a certain orientation, i don't think they should be held accountable for it. it doesn't sit right with me to think that a couple of the same sex shouldn't be allowed to get married just because of their orientation.\n\ni think the key thing is that people are born the way they are, whether they're straight, gay, or whatever. it's not something that can be changed, and i don't think it's fair to judge someone for it. so, in my opinion, it's just wrong to deny people the right to get married based on their orientation.\n\ni'm not sure if i've really given this topic much thought, but i think it's clear to me that it's not about making a choice, it's about being who you are. and i don't think the federal government should be involved in making decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nit's just not their place to dictate how people live their lives, especially when it's something as fundamental as who they can marry. it's not a matter of national security or morality, it's just a matter of letting people be themselves. and if that means a same-sex couple wants to get married, then that's their choice, not the government's.\n\nanyway, that's my two cents on the matter. i'm not sure if i've made myself clear, but i think it's pretty simple - people should be free to live their lives as they see fit, and the government should stay out of it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no valid reason not to. The argument that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is just not convincing, considering the complexity of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct entities that can't be reduced to simple opposition. The fact is, gay couples have the same fundamental rights as straight couples, including property rights and access to healthcare, which are essential for ensuring the well-being of all individuals.\n\nHowever, when it comes to healthcare, gay couples often face unique challenges. For instance, their partners may not be recognized as family members, even if they're in a long-term committed relationship, which can limit their access to care and support. This seems unreasonable, especially considering the importance of having a supportive partner during times of illness.\n\nResearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of forming stable and fulfilling relationships as straight couples. They share similar relationship dynamics, and their relationships are just as likely to succeed. The trouble is that many people are hung up on the idea that gay marriage is somehow against their religious beliefs or moral code. But if we're talking about a civil union, a legal document issued by the government, then what's the issue? It's not about church and state; it's about recognizing the rights of all citizens.\n\nThe concept of segregation, where certain groups are treated unequally, is a major concern here. It's similar to the old days of \"separate but equal,\" which we've learned is fundamentally unfair. Gay couples are not asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document that recognizes their commitment to each other.\n\nPeople worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and prejudices. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted as those raised by straight parents. The real issue is how society treats these children, not their parents' sexual orientation. In fact, many schools and communities are working to create inclusive environments for these children, acknowledging that they deserve the same love, support, and respect as any other child.\n\nThe federal government should take a more prominent role in ensuring that gay marriage is recognized and protected nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is a step in the wrong direction, as it would impose a narrow, religious-based view on the entire country. This would be hypocritical, considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" debate and the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, organizations like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based research over personal opinions and cultural norms. If we listened more to institutions that conduct rigorous studies and less to popular opinion, we might gain a more nuanced understanding of these issues.",
            "Alright, so here's the thing, I work at the hospital pharmacy over the summer, and let's be real, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it can't have some benefits. I'm saying no to making it available to the general public, no way, but using it for medicinal purposes? That's a different story. We use loads of controlled substances in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, and they're super beneficial. So, just because marijuana is taboo doesn't mean we should deny its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not like these other controlled substances, either. If you abuse marijuana, it's not the same as abusing alcohol, which can lead to serious issues. It's a tough call, but I think we should allow it gradually, not all at once, because that would just lead to overuse. We need to break down the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might start using it responsibly.\n\nThe issue is that people have this awful image of marijuana in their heads, which isn't entirely fair. It's not like heroin or cocaine; it's not that bad for you. If we can change that image, people might start using it for medical purposes, and who knows, responsibly.",
            "i think the church has made an effort to adapt to modern times, but it's still not the strict institution it used to be.  growing up, i was a regular at church every sunday, dressing up in cute outfits, matching shoes, and a purse.  it was part of my routine, especially since i attended a private school where i saw my friends every weekend.  but over time, the church has changed, introducing a teenager mass that's just 30 minutes long and allowing more casual attire, even for the morning masses.  during the summer, people often show up in beachwear, and families often rush in late.  it's become a more relaxed atmosphere, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of traditional church clothes.  while it's nice to see a more casual approach, it's still the church i know.  as for the church's internal politics, i'm not well-versed on the details, but that's my general observation.\n\nregarding the accusations of pedophilia within the catholic church, i think these issues could've been avoided regardless of the church's policies on female priests or married priests.  in my opinion, pedophilia is more of a personal issue, and it's the individual's choice to become a priest.  there are already married men who become pedophiles, so allowing them to get married wouldn't necessarily solve the problem.  i also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's a personal decision, and they should consider a faith that allows them to be married if that's what they want.\n\nto elaborate, i think pedophilia is more of a genetic issue than something someone develops due to their environment.  while upbringing might play a small role, i believe it's largely based on genetics.  you can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and it's unlikely they'll be able to hide their true nature.  if the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a different matter altogether.  however, i don't think they necessarily knew about every case.  overall, i don't have any other thoughts on the catholic church beyond this.",
            "I'll be honest, my initial take on the whole situation was quite acceptable, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and the invasion of Iraq was largely a pretext. I believe the Bush administration initially tried to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nTo be frank, the fact that the Bush administration has been so open about lying to the American people really gets my blood boiling. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's a huge red flag in my book – it's essentially malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense.\n\nIt seems to me that the administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution and tried to marginalize it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war, and I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration's issues with him. On top of that, Bush's true motives seemed to be expanding our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nFrankly, I think it's time to move on, but withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more casualties. The alternative, which the UN and US are considering, is to form a coalition with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It'll likely lead to more problems down the line, especially with Iraq's sovereignty being a major issue. The interim government is essentially falling apart, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the situation. Even Mugtada al-Sadr's party holds a significant amount of power, and we're still dealing with radical elements fighting for control. It's clear the political process is facing a lot of friction due to these factors.\n\nTo be blunt, I don't have any polite words for the whole situation.",
            "i've been wanting to discuss my thoughts about the war in iraq for a while now, but to be honest, it's a really complicated topic for me. i guess you could say i'm still trying to wrap my head around it. one thing that's been on my mind is that it's not even a declared war, which kinda makes it hard to understand our presence over there. i feel like it was more of a retaliatory measure after the 9/11 attacks, and we've been staying in iraq to try and establish a democracy, which sounds great on paper, but it's not that simple. we're also trying to secure oil resources, which isn't a very compelling reason to stay. the problem is, we're just making things worse for everyone involved. if we stay, we'll have to invest a lot of time and money in building a democracy, which is a long-term commitment, and if we leave, the iraqis will be left to pick up the pieces and deal with the aftermath. it's a tough situation, and to be honest, i don't feel like i have a clear answer.\n\ni've been thinking a lot about how we got into this situation and how we can get out of it. one thing that's been on my mind is that we never actually declared war in congress, so it's not even a 'real' war in the eyes of some people. i'm not sure what the point is in staying over there anymore, and it's making our country look bad in the eyes of the world. it's a bit like the vietnam war, which was also undeclared and is now seen as a pointless conflict. our president is getting a bad reputation because of it, and i feel bad for him, but ultimately, it's not just about him - it's about the people who are suffering in iraq.\n\ni know some people have family members fighting over there, and it's hard to say that i want the war to end when i know how much it affects them. but at the same time, i'm worried that our presence is causing more harm than good. we're trying to impose our way of life on the iraqis, which isn't going to work, and it's only going to make them more resentful towards us. the whole al-qaeda thing is just going to get worse, and our efforts to establish a democracy are going to be a long, drawn-out process. i think this conflict is going to drag on for years to come, and i'm not sure what the end result will be.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure if I should even be having this conversation. But here's my take on it: I don't think it's right for a state to make it legal or even declare it as legal. I believe that's a decision that should be left up to the churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of that.\n\nIn my opinion, the people pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think any attempt to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and go against what's already been written. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right at all.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. It seems to me that the president's push for this amendment is driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There's no solid reason behind this amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society.\n\nTo be honest, I've said most of what I want to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, so I'm thinking about the war in Iraq and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. In my opinion, there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they're not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people following the 9/11 attacks and used that to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of sorts of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the aftermath of the invasion. A huge number of American soldiers have died, which is absolutely heartbreaking, and the US government wasn't prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to establish a democratic one, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, but it's a much more complicated process than people initially thought. The government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal, and not a clear-cut victory. In Vietnam, the US fought against an actual army, but in Iraq, they're fighting against citizens, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency.\n\nI think the government made a mistake by going to war without planning for all possible outcomes, and they weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying, and the US is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police to secure their own country. It's a long process, and I think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful mission.\n\nWe shouldn't have underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government, and it's not an easy thing to do, as we can see from our own country's history. The government made it seem like a relatively easy task, but it's not. \n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was weighing my options, and one of my reasons for considering George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, now that we've been in Iraq for so long, it's hard to justify continuing the war, especially considering the number of American casualties. It's a difficult decision, and I think we should try to see it through, but we also need to consider the astronomical number of casualties and whether it's worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIt's also interesting that we're not taking similar actions in other countries, like North Korea, which has weapons of mass destruction, but we're not targeting them. I think the real reason for invading Iraq is the oil issue and controlling resources. Another reason was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, it probably won't be that straightforward.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where to start with this, but I guess I'll just dive right in: I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage. I've always been, and I'm not really sure why I need to explain it, but I suppose I do. I think it's a deeply personal preference and something that's increasingly being shown to have a biological component, rather than being solely a product of societal influences. This makes it even harder to justify denying people the rights they deserve just because of something they can't control.\n\nI've always believed that it's inhumane to withhold rights based on something that's beyond an individual's control. And, to be honest, I think it's rather hypocritical for politicians and the government to try to dictate what constitutes a marriage. Marriage is a personal, intimate relationship that affects individuals at a deeply personal level, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they live their lives just like any other family would - they walk their dogs, go about their daily routines, and contribute to their community in the same ways as everyone else.\n\nIt's just ridiculous that the politicians are trying to impose their own twisted interpretation of marriage on everyone else. Bush's attempt to redefine marriage is nothing short of absurd. I've read and heard from countless credible sources that there's a chemical aspect to being gay, a predisposition that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. This biologically-based aspect is vastly different from sociological factors that might influence someone's choices.\n\nTo me, the most obvious issue with gay marriage is that it's a private matter, not something that should be subject to public scrutiny or federal approval. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, and it won't make the headlines. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front-page news. I think that's a clear indication that we need to treat marriage as a private, personal issue, rather than a matter of public policy.",
            "Honestly, people often neglect the fact that anything posted online is now public domain. It's completely out in the open, and you can't retract it if you change your mind. As an RA, I've already dealt with this issue firsthand. When you share something, it can shape how others view you, and that's something to consider. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, someone's bound to react. You can't hide that information, and it's not something you can just keep to yourself.\n\nThe internet is a broad platform that everyone can access. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll likely see their bulletin. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in our case, but someone had access to it and shared it with the authorities. The school has a responsibility to act on potentially threatening situations to prevent harm.\n\nIt's difficult to know what to take seriously when some people post things as jokes or for a sociological experiment. We had a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's online presence was reviewed, and some of the content they had posted was perceived as serious, even though it might have been intended as a joke.\n\nWhen you post something online, you lose any expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, you shouldn't post it. You can't dictate what others think or take seriously. I don't think it's a good idea for school officials to have social media accounts and be friends with students. However, if something's brought to their attention, they can't ignore it if it poses a potential threat.\n\nI don't think schools should monitor phone conversations, texts, or IMs, but if a student reports a concern, it's a different story. As an RA, I don't even have a Facebook or Myspace account – I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives or see their photos online. It's not my place to know that information, and I certainly don't want the responsibility that comes with it.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At the beginning, the idea was to restore democracy in a country that was in dire need of it, but I think we've lost sight of that original purpose a long time ago. It seems like we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a superpower. \n\nI've always wondered if the motives behind the war were pure to begin with, especially considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If our goal was genuinely to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, that would be a noble cause – as long as it wasn't motivated by personal interests. But I believe that's not the case. The war has dragged on for over a year, and I think we've already made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a powerful statement in itself.\n\nHowever, the fact that it's been going on for years is just ridiculous. If our initial intention was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a just cause. But I think our reasons have been distorted and misconstrued over time. It seems like we're still fighting just for the sake of fighting, and we don't want to end the war without a clear victory. \n\nI truly believe it's time to bring this war to an end. Our government officials need to take responsibility for their own affairs, and I think that time has come. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal issues that need funding. I think it's a drain on our economy for a cause that's long since been lost.\n\nThe amount of money being spent is staggering – billions and billions of dollars that could be better spent on our own internal problems, like public roads, education, and healthcare. It's disheartening to think that some of our own citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost sight of its purpose. I think that's a tragedy.",
            "I had a question that I wanted to clarify, but I'm not sure where to start. It seems that someone was able to intervene in a situation because they found some information online that was quite revealing.\n\nHonestly, it's pretty much expected that when you post stuff online, especially on sites like Myspace, it's going to be out there for everyone to see. You have to be a member to view someone's profile, but that's because you've essentially given permission for others to see it when you accepted their friend request. So, anytime you put information online, you have to be aware that a lot of people might see it.\n\nI have to admit, in this case, I think it's a good thing that someone was able to see that information and prevent a potentially serious situation. However, I can see why it's tricky. It's not practical or fair to have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles just in case. It could be seen as discriminatory if they're only focusing on certain people.\n\nI'm not sure how it would work in practice, but it's all about context. Was someone just browsing randomly or were they actively looking for something specific? If it's the former, it's a bit creepy, but if it's the latter, then maybe it's not such a bad thing.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who could be seeing my information. I recall this one TV show where a guy demonstrated just how easy it is to get information online and use it to meet people. It's unnerving, to say the least. I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they can figure out who I am and contact me through instant messaging. It's a delicate balance between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends and classmates. It's a tough issue because you never know who might be looking at what. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned Myspace, and it seemed a bit strange. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complicated situation, and I'm still not entirely sure what to think about it.",
            "i'm having trouble talking about the Iraq War, to be honest, because I feel like I'm jumping on a bandwagon \nI'm hesitant to admit that I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore \nThe general consensus among people, except for those within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea, and I'm inclined to agree \nLooking at the polls - both in the US, Iraq, and globally - it's clear that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a mistake \nIn fact, even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year \nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the get-go, and it's becoming increasingly clear that pulling out won't be easy either \nI think it's because of the huge cultural divide between the US and the Middle East, and the fact that we're trying to impose democracy in a region where it may not be welcomed \nI mean, Saddam was without a doubt a bad guy, but you can't just invade a country without considering the potential consequences \nIt's like trying to impose Western values on a completely different culture \nI'm still not convinced that there's a good reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary \nI'm not sure I buy the administration's arguments for why we should stay, and I'm yet to hear a legitimate reason for extending our presence \nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now \nIt's clear that the Iraqi people would like us to leave, with around 80% wanting us out within a year and a quarter thinking we should leave immediately \nIt makes sense to me that they might know better than we do, and if we ask them and they say yes, then it's on them if things go wrong \nIf we leave, at least we can say we tried to do the right thing, even if it's not like we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East",
            "i think there's still a lot of gender discrimination going on in the US.  i'm not just talking about women, though - it's also about the specific job or field someone's in.  overall, i feel like women have it tougher because there's this concept of a 'glass ceiling' where they're supposed to be equal but in reality, people often have a hard time accepting a woman in charge, even when she's qualified for the job.  it's because of how society's been raised for so long - people are used to men being in charge.  so, women might see a job they're qualified for, but the board won't promote them because it's not common to see women in upper management.  the same thing happens to men in industries like fashion or childcare - it's not common for men to be the primary caregivers, and people look down on them for it.  they're seen as the breadwinners and it's weird if they stay home to take care of the kids.\n\nin fashion, it's even harder for men who are straight because people don't take them seriously.  it's like, if you're a man who's into fashion, people assume you're not really into it because it's not typically something men do.  they think you're just pretending to be like other guys who are into fashion.  it's the same with women in male-dominated fields - people assume they're not really good at it because they're women.\n\nit's hard to change this mindset because society is set in its ways.  we've made progress, but it's slow.  we've come a long way since the 1800s, but it's still a slow process.  women are getting into higher positions and becoming CEOs, which is a good start.  and it's also becoming more acceptable for men to be stay-at-home dads.  but we still have to promote the good qualities of people who are being stereotyped.  we can't just force it, because people will resist.  we're at a good point now where we're starting to see some changes, but it takes time.\n\nanother thing is that people are discriminated against based on where they're from, not just their gender.  like, if you grew up on a farm and you're not a great speaker, but you're super intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, people might look down on you because of your accent.  or if you're a man and you're not a good writer, people might think you're not smart because of that.  it's not just about gender, it's about where you come from and how you speak.",
            "So, I wanted to clarify how the law has changed on this issue. They've made some changes, apparently decriminalizing it, which means it's not as serious of an offense as it used to be. It's more like getting a traffic ticket, where you might get fined, but you won't be arrested and charged like before. Now, I know some people might worry about the future consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized - it can still impact things like job interviews and other opportunities. On the other hand, there's a argument that arresting people, prosecuting them, and putting them through the system is really expensive. When you think about it, it adds up - arresting, booking, housing them, and then going through the court process, just to let them go. Plus, there's the cost of appointing a public defender, paying the judge, and having the state attorney's office handle the case. It all adds up, and it's not a small expense.\n\nIn places that are struggling financially, some officials might not be willing to make this change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things. But in cities like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize marijuana. I think it's a good idea because it can free up funds for things like education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not just about making marijuana freely available; it's about the financial benefits and the potential to use that money for good.\n\nOf course, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available. Some people might worry that it would be too easily accessible, like cigarettes sold in gas stations. That could lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem. Marijuana is still stigmatized in many places, and having it out in the open might make people uncomfortable. \n\nI think in general, alcohol has more severe effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. However, it's hard to make generalizations because everyone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle them well, while others struggle with moderation. It's complex, and it's hard to make blanket statements about marijuana or any other substance.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with certain aspects of the Catholic Church, but I also see some inconsistency in their practices. They've maintained many traditions over time, which is good, but it's also essential to be open to change. On one hand, I think it's beneficial to draw from the past, but on the other hand, it's frustrating when it seems like the Church is inflexible and judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine precisely.\n\nFor instance, many Catholics believe in attending mass regularly, and they can be quite strict about how things are done. I feel that the Church sometimes looks down on people who don't conform to their expectations, and they also tend to be exclusive towards those with different faiths.\n\nMy personal experience with this is that my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's non-Catholic background. This didn't really demonstrate tolerance for other faiths, which is a core Catholic teaching – to love others. However, the Church's actions often seem hypocritical in this regard.\n\nI'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue, and I think people who engage in such acts would do so regardless of their marital status. It's not like having a spouse would somehow magically prevent them from harming children. So, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a solution to this problem.",
            "Well, I'm still undecided on this issue, but I think it's one of the most difficult topics we're dealing with right now. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a big part of it, and defining marriage in a way that doesn't offend anyone is a challenge in itself. I'm not sure if I think marriage should be viewed as a sacrament by the government or just a civil union between two people. If it's the former, then people might not get tax breaks or any special treatment if they're baptized, which seems unfair. On the other hand, if we view it as a civil union, then the government shouldn't be concerned with the details of the marriage, like whether it's a church wedding or not. It's just about two people who have committed to each other.\n\nIf that's the case, then the fact that gay couples can't get married because of the term \"marriage\" seems ridiculous. It's just a matter of two people getting a civil union, and that's it. If all the states could come to a sense of reason on this issue, then it should become a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a bit much. It's not a huge issue that should warrant changing the constitution. It's not important enough to amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that simple.",
            "I come from a Christian background, so I've always viewed homosexuality as a somewhat complex issue. Having a large circle of gay friends has made me think more deeply about it. While I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I think it's a matter that individual states should decide on their own, rather than relying on a national decision. This is because many states have different political leanings – some are more democratic, while others are more republican. If you live in a state with a democratic government, it's likely that they'll support gay marriage, and it's hard to disagree with their decision when you chose to live there. My stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so each state should have the freedom to decide on legalization based on their own values. I think it's unfair for the president to impose a blanket ban on gay marriage across the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his call to decide how each state should govern itself. Plus, he'll be out of office soon, and future presidents will likely have their own views on the matter. It's better to let individual states make their own decisions, as they'll have to live with the consequences. They're the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision, not the president.",
            "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I completely disagree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor a site like Myspace. Let me explain why. Myspace is a public platform, and as such, it's a place where users share content for anyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to understand that it's going to be viewed by others, including school officials. Even if you're not using the school's name, they could still access it from their homes.\n\nIn this case, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. The school system's primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of its students, and if that means checking out student activity on Myspace, then so be it. It's not an invasion of privacy if it helps prevent harm.\n\nLet's be real, if school officials are going on Myspace specifically to catch students misbehaving, that's a different story. That's an overreach. But if they're doing it to keep students safe, then I think it's a necessary measure. As long as it doesn't infringe on individual rights, I'm okay with it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but when you're talking, it's a bit more challenging. Let me try to clarify. If you post something on Myspace and expect not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Everything you post online is public, and it can come back to haunt you.\n\nThink about it like this: if you're a college student and you say something questionable in an email, it's going to follow you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. It's not like you can just erase it. If you're going to post something online, be prepared for the consequences.\n\nIn my opinion, students shouldn't be worried about school officials going on Myspace to catch them misbehaving. But if it leads to making the school system safer, then that's a different story. Other officials, like the police, should be allowed to monitor it too.\n\nWhen parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment. That's what school officials are trying to ensure. They're not just being nosy; they're trying to prevent something like a school shooting from happening. We had lockdown drills in my high school, and it was to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nIt's the same principle here. The school officials were doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. They were making the school a safer place, and that's something we should appreciate.\n\nThat's my take on it. I don't have much more to add.",
            "I've been hesitant to share my thoughts on the war, partly because I was personally affected by 9/11. At first, I was on board with the idea of going over there and making our presence known, but as time went on, I began to see the bigger picture. I think we rushed into the situation without a thorough plan, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's done anything meaningful, and I believe that as long as the people over there are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. But, unfortunately, 9/11 changed my perspective, and I've become somewhat apathetic towards their struggles. I sometimes feel like they're not even human, the way they wage war, and it's like they're not really trying to better their country. I think they just want us out, and that's it.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we went into this war with a lot of emotional baggage and a desire for revenge. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, at the time, somewhat understandable. We couldn't just let the attack go unpunished, but I do think we could have come up with a better plan. There was a lack of unity and a clear direction, which made things worse.\n\nIt's my honest opinion that we're not the ones to change those people. They're always going to be the way they are, and I don't think we're making enough progress to justify staying there. In fact, I believe that once we leave, everything will collapse, and we'll just be causing harm to ourselves by prolonging our stay. We can't stay there indefinitely, so it's better to just pull out and focus on our own issues."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes to stay relevant.  I think one reason people are losing interest in the Church is because it isn't very open-minded when it comes to certain issues.  They have rigid views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are outdated in many ways.  If they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, I don't think they'd be worried about losing followers. \n\nI've heard many people are turning against the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues.  People are starting to disagree with them on these topics, and that's causing some to question the Church's views.  They feel the Church is out of touch with modern values.  For example, if you support abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that sees it as morally wrong.  Similarly, if you're in favor of gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that disapproves of it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or have priests who are married.  It's not clear if that would have prevented scandals like the ones we've seen, but it's an idea worth considering.  It's hard to say whether allowing married priests or women priests would have made a difference, but it's worth exploring.  It's worth noting that other jobs involve balancing work and personal life – why can't priests do the same?\n\nThe Church views priests as married to God, devoted to a life of service.  However, most people in the world have a job and a family life, and they manage to balance both.  So, I don't see why priests can't have both a career and a family.",
            "to be honest, i'm a bit hesitant to express my thoughts on the topic of gay marriage. let me just say that personally, i don't have an issue with it - i think people should be free to live their lives however they choose. it's not something that i think is a conscious choice, and if someone is born with a certain orientation, i don't think they should be held accountable for it. it doesn't sit right with me to think that a couple of the same sex shouldn't be allowed to get married just because of their orientation.\n\ni think the key thing is that people are born the way they are, whether they're straight, gay, or whatever. it's not something that can be changed, and i don't think it's fair to judge someone for it. so, in my opinion, it's just wrong to deny people the right to get married based on their orientation.\n\ni'm not sure if i've really given this topic much thought, but i think it's clear to me that it's not about making a choice, it's about being who you are. and i don't think the federal government should be involved in making decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nit's just not their place to dictate how people live their lives, especially when it's something as fundamental as who they can marry. it's not a matter of national security or morality, it's just a matter of letting people be themselves. and if that means a same-sex couple wants to get married, then that's their choice, not the government's.\n\nanyway, that's my two cents on the matter. i'm not sure if i've made myself clear, but i think it's pretty simple - people should be free to live their lives as they see fit, and the government should stay out of it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no valid reason not to. The argument that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is just not convincing, considering the complexity of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct entities that can't be reduced to simple opposition. The fact is, gay couples have the same fundamental rights as straight couples, including property rights and access to healthcare, which are essential for ensuring the well-being of all individuals.\n\nHowever, when it comes to healthcare, gay couples often face unique challenges. For instance, their partners may not be recognized as family members, even if they're in a long-term committed relationship, which can limit their access to care and support. This seems unreasonable, especially considering the importance of having a supportive partner during times of illness.\n\nResearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of forming stable and fulfilling relationships as straight couples. They share similar relationship dynamics, and their relationships are just as likely to succeed. The trouble is that many people are hung up on the idea that gay marriage is somehow against their religious beliefs or moral code. But if we're talking about a civil union, a legal document issued by the government, then what's the issue? It's not about church and state; it's about recognizing the rights of all citizens.\n\nThe concept of segregation, where certain groups are treated unequally, is a major concern here. It's similar to the old days of \"separate but equal,\" which we've learned is fundamentally unfair. Gay couples are not asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document that recognizes their commitment to each other.\n\nPeople worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and prejudices. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted as those raised by straight parents. The real issue is how society treats these children, not their parents' sexual orientation. In fact, many schools and communities are working to create inclusive environments for these children, acknowledging that they deserve the same love, support, and respect as any other child.\n\nThe federal government should take a more prominent role in ensuring that gay marriage is recognized and protected nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is a step in the wrong direction, as it would impose a narrow, religious-based view on the entire country. This would be hypocritical, considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" debate and the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, organizations like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based research over personal opinions and cultural norms. If we listened more to institutions that conduct rigorous studies and less to popular opinion, we might gain a more nuanced understanding of these issues.",
            "Alright, so here's the thing, I work at the hospital pharmacy over the summer, and let's be real, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it can't have some benefits. I'm saying no to making it available to the general public, no way, but using it for medicinal purposes? That's a different story. We use loads of controlled substances in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, and they're super beneficial. So, just because marijuana is taboo doesn't mean we should deny its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not like these other controlled substances, either. If you abuse marijuana, it's not the same as abusing alcohol, which can lead to serious issues. It's a tough call, but I think we should allow it gradually, not all at once, because that would just lead to overuse. We need to break down the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might start using it responsibly.\n\nThe issue is that people have this awful image of marijuana in their heads, which isn't entirely fair. It's not like heroin or cocaine; it's not that bad for you. If we can change that image, people might start using it for medical purposes, and who knows, responsibly.",
            "i think the church has made an effort to adapt to modern times, but it's still not the strict institution it used to be.  growing up, i was a regular at church every sunday, dressing up in cute outfits, matching shoes, and a purse.  it was part of my routine, especially since i attended a private school where i saw my friends every weekend.  but over time, the church has changed, introducing a teenager mass that's just 30 minutes long and allowing more casual attire, even for the morning masses.  during the summer, people often show up in beachwear, and families often rush in late.  it's become a more relaxed atmosphere, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of traditional church clothes.  while it's nice to see a more casual approach, it's still the church i know.  as for the church's internal politics, i'm not well-versed on the details, but that's my general observation.\n\nregarding the accusations of pedophilia within the catholic church, i think these issues could've been avoided regardless of the church's policies on female priests or married priests.  in my opinion, pedophilia is more of a personal issue, and it's the individual's choice to become a priest.  there are already married men who become pedophiles, so allowing them to get married wouldn't necessarily solve the problem.  i also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's a personal decision, and they should consider a faith that allows them to be married if that's what they want.\n\nto elaborate, i think pedophilia is more of a genetic issue than something someone develops due to their environment.  while upbringing might play a small role, i believe it's largely based on genetics.  you can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and it's unlikely they'll be able to hide their true nature.  if the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a different matter altogether.  however, i don't think they necessarily knew about every case.  overall, i don't have any other thoughts on the catholic church beyond this.",
            "I'll be honest, my initial take on the whole situation was quite acceptable, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and the invasion of Iraq was largely a pretext. I believe the Bush administration initially tried to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nTo be frank, the fact that the Bush administration has been so open about lying to the American people really gets my blood boiling. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's a huge red flag in my book – it's essentially malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense.\n\nIt seems to me that the administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution and tried to marginalize it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war, and I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration's issues with him. On top of that, Bush's true motives seemed to be expanding our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nFrankly, I think it's time to move on, but withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more casualties. The alternative, which the UN and US are considering, is to form a coalition with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It'll likely lead to more problems down the line, especially with Iraq's sovereignty being a major issue. The interim government is essentially falling apart, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the situation. Even Mugtada al-Sadr's party holds a significant amount of power, and we're still dealing with radical elements fighting for control. It's clear the political process is facing a lot of friction due to these factors.\n\nTo be blunt, I don't have any polite words for the whole situation.",
            "i've been wanting to discuss my thoughts about the war in iraq for a while now, but to be honest, it's a really complicated topic for me. i guess you could say i'm still trying to wrap my head around it. one thing that's been on my mind is that it's not even a declared war, which kinda makes it hard to understand our presence over there. i feel like it was more of a retaliatory measure after the 9/11 attacks, and we've been staying in iraq to try and establish a democracy, which sounds great on paper, but it's not that simple. we're also trying to secure oil resources, which isn't a very compelling reason to stay. the problem is, we're just making things worse for everyone involved. if we stay, we'll have to invest a lot of time and money in building a democracy, which is a long-term commitment, and if we leave, the iraqis will be left to pick up the pieces and deal with the aftermath. it's a tough situation, and to be honest, i don't feel like i have a clear answer.\n\ni've been thinking a lot about how we got into this situation and how we can get out of it. one thing that's been on my mind is that we never actually declared war in congress, so it's not even a 'real' war in the eyes of some people. i'm not sure what the point is in staying over there anymore, and it's making our country look bad in the eyes of the world. it's a bit like the vietnam war, which was also undeclared and is now seen as a pointless conflict. our president is getting a bad reputation because of it, and i feel bad for him, but ultimately, it's not just about him - it's about the people who are suffering in iraq.\n\ni know some people have family members fighting over there, and it's hard to say that i want the war to end when i know how much it affects them. but at the same time, i'm worried that our presence is causing more harm than good. we're trying to impose our way of life on the iraqis, which isn't going to work, and it's only going to make them more resentful towards us. the whole al-qaeda thing is just going to get worse, and our efforts to establish a democracy are going to be a long, drawn-out process. i think this conflict is going to drag on for years to come, and i'm not sure what the end result will be.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure if I should even be having this conversation. But here's my take on it: I don't think it's right for a state to make it legal or even declare it as legal. I believe that's a decision that should be left up to the churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of that.\n\nIn my opinion, the people pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think any attempt to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and go against what's already been written. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right at all.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. It seems to me that the president's push for this amendment is driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There's no solid reason behind this amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society.\n\nTo be honest, I've said most of what I want to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, so I'm thinking about the war in Iraq and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. In my opinion, there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they're not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people following the 9/11 attacks and used that to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of sorts of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the aftermath of the invasion. A huge number of American soldiers have died, which is absolutely heartbreaking, and the US government wasn't prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to establish a democratic one, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, but it's a much more complicated process than people initially thought. The government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal, and not a clear-cut victory. In Vietnam, the US fought against an actual army, but in Iraq, they're fighting against citizens, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency.\n\nI think the government made a mistake by going to war without planning for all possible outcomes, and they weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying, and the US is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police to secure their own country. It's a long process, and I think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful mission.\n\nWe shouldn't have underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government, and it's not an easy thing to do, as we can see from our own country's history. The government made it seem like a relatively easy task, but it's not. \n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was weighing my options, and one of my reasons for considering George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, now that we've been in Iraq for so long, it's hard to justify continuing the war, especially considering the number of American casualties. It's a difficult decision, and I think we should try to see it through, but we also need to consider the astronomical number of casualties and whether it's worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIt's also interesting that we're not taking similar actions in other countries, like North Korea, which has weapons of mass destruction, but we're not targeting them. I think the real reason for invading Iraq is the oil issue and controlling resources. Another reason was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, it probably won't be that straightforward.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where to start with this, but I guess I'll just dive right in: I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage. I've always been, and I'm not really sure why I need to explain it, but I suppose I do. I think it's a deeply personal preference and something that's increasingly being shown to have a biological component, rather than being solely a product of societal influences. This makes it even harder to justify denying people the rights they deserve just because of something they can't control.\n\nI've always believed that it's inhumane to withhold rights based on something that's beyond an individual's control. And, to be honest, I think it's rather hypocritical for politicians and the government to try to dictate what constitutes a marriage. Marriage is a personal, intimate relationship that affects individuals at a deeply personal level, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they live their lives just like any other family would - they walk their dogs, go about their daily routines, and contribute to their community in the same ways as everyone else.\n\nIt's just ridiculous that the politicians are trying to impose their own twisted interpretation of marriage on everyone else. Bush's attempt to redefine marriage is nothing short of absurd. I've read and heard from countless credible sources that there's a chemical aspect to being gay, a predisposition that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. This biologically-based aspect is vastly different from sociological factors that might influence someone's choices.\n\nTo me, the most obvious issue with gay marriage is that it's a private matter, not something that should be subject to public scrutiny or federal approval. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, and it won't make the headlines. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front-page news. I think that's a clear indication that we need to treat marriage as a private, personal issue, rather than a matter of public policy.",
            "Honestly, people often neglect the fact that anything posted online is now public domain. It's completely out in the open, and you can't retract it if you change your mind. As an RA, I've already dealt with this issue firsthand. When you share something, it can shape how others view you, and that's something to consider. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, someone's bound to react. You can't hide that information, and it's not something you can just keep to yourself.\n\nThe internet is a broad platform that everyone can access. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll likely see their bulletin. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in our case, but someone had access to it and shared it with the authorities. The school has a responsibility to act on potentially threatening situations to prevent harm.\n\nIt's difficult to know what to take seriously when some people post things as jokes or for a sociological experiment. We had a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's online presence was reviewed, and some of the content they had posted was perceived as serious, even though it might have been intended as a joke.\n\nWhen you post something online, you lose any expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, you shouldn't post it. You can't dictate what others think or take seriously. I don't think it's a good idea for school officials to have social media accounts and be friends with students. However, if something's brought to their attention, they can't ignore it if it poses a potential threat.\n\nI don't think schools should monitor phone conversations, texts, or IMs, but if a student reports a concern, it's a different story. As an RA, I don't even have a Facebook or Myspace account – I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives or see their photos online. It's not my place to know that information, and I certainly don't want the responsibility that comes with it.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At the beginning, the idea was to restore democracy in a country that was in dire need of it, but I think we've lost sight of that original purpose a long time ago. It seems like we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a superpower. \n\nI've always wondered if the motives behind the war were pure to begin with, especially considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If our goal was genuinely to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, that would be a noble cause – as long as it wasn't motivated by personal interests. But I believe that's not the case. The war has dragged on for over a year, and I think we've already made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a powerful statement in itself.\n\nHowever, the fact that it's been going on for years is just ridiculous. If our initial intention was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a just cause. But I think our reasons have been distorted and misconstrued over time. It seems like we're still fighting just for the sake of fighting, and we don't want to end the war without a clear victory. \n\nI truly believe it's time to bring this war to an end. Our government officials need to take responsibility for their own affairs, and I think that time has come. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal issues that need funding. I think it's a drain on our economy for a cause that's long since been lost.\n\nThe amount of money being spent is staggering – billions and billions of dollars that could be better spent on our own internal problems, like public roads, education, and healthcare. It's disheartening to think that some of our own citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost sight of its purpose. I think that's a tragedy.",
            "I had a question that I wanted to clarify, but I'm not sure where to start. It seems that someone was able to intervene in a situation because they found some information online that was quite revealing.\n\nHonestly, it's pretty much expected that when you post stuff online, especially on sites like Myspace, it's going to be out there for everyone to see. You have to be a member to view someone's profile, but that's because you've essentially given permission for others to see it when you accepted their friend request. So, anytime you put information online, you have to be aware that a lot of people might see it.\n\nI have to admit, in this case, I think it's a good thing that someone was able to see that information and prevent a potentially serious situation. However, I can see why it's tricky. It's not practical or fair to have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles just in case. It could be seen as discriminatory if they're only focusing on certain people.\n\nI'm not sure how it would work in practice, but it's all about context. Was someone just browsing randomly or were they actively looking for something specific? If it's the former, it's a bit creepy, but if it's the latter, then maybe it's not such a bad thing.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who could be seeing my information. I recall this one TV show where a guy demonstrated just how easy it is to get information online and use it to meet people. It's unnerving, to say the least. I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they can figure out who I am and contact me through instant messaging. It's a delicate balance between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends and classmates. It's a tough issue because you never know who might be looking at what. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned Myspace, and it seemed a bit strange. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complicated situation, and I'm still not entirely sure what to think about it.",
            "i'm having trouble talking about the Iraq War, to be honest, because I feel like I'm jumping on a bandwagon \nI'm hesitant to admit that I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore \nThe general consensus among people, except for those within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea, and I'm inclined to agree \nLooking at the polls - both in the US, Iraq, and globally - it's clear that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a mistake \nIn fact, even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year \nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the get-go, and it's becoming increasingly clear that pulling out won't be easy either \nI think it's because of the huge cultural divide between the US and the Middle East, and the fact that we're trying to impose democracy in a region where it may not be welcomed \nI mean, Saddam was without a doubt a bad guy, but you can't just invade a country without considering the potential consequences \nIt's like trying to impose Western values on a completely different culture \nI'm still not convinced that there's a good reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary \nI'm not sure I buy the administration's arguments for why we should stay, and I'm yet to hear a legitimate reason for extending our presence \nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now \nIt's clear that the Iraqi people would like us to leave, with around 80% wanting us out within a year and a quarter thinking we should leave immediately \nIt makes sense to me that they might know better than we do, and if we ask them and they say yes, then it's on them if things go wrong \nIf we leave, at least we can say we tried to do the right thing, even if it's not like we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East",
            "i think there's still a lot of gender discrimination going on in the US.  i'm not just talking about women, though - it's also about the specific job or field someone's in.  overall, i feel like women have it tougher because there's this concept of a 'glass ceiling' where they're supposed to be equal but in reality, people often have a hard time accepting a woman in charge, even when she's qualified for the job.  it's because of how society's been raised for so long - people are used to men being in charge.  so, women might see a job they're qualified for, but the board won't promote them because it's not common to see women in upper management.  the same thing happens to men in industries like fashion or childcare - it's not common for men to be the primary caregivers, and people look down on them for it.  they're seen as the breadwinners and it's weird if they stay home to take care of the kids.\n\nin fashion, it's even harder for men who are straight because people don't take them seriously.  it's like, if you're a man who's into fashion, people assume you're not really into it because it's not typically something men do.  they think you're just pretending to be like other guys who are into fashion.  it's the same with women in male-dominated fields - people assume they're not really good at it because they're women.\n\nit's hard to change this mindset because society is set in its ways.  we've made progress, but it's slow.  we've come a long way since the 1800s, but it's still a slow process.  women are getting into higher positions and becoming CEOs, which is a good start.  and it's also becoming more acceptable for men to be stay-at-home dads.  but we still have to promote the good qualities of people who are being stereotyped.  we can't just force it, because people will resist.  we're at a good point now where we're starting to see some changes, but it takes time.\n\nanother thing is that people are discriminated against based on where they're from, not just their gender.  like, if you grew up on a farm and you're not a great speaker, but you're super intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, people might look down on you because of your accent.  or if you're a man and you're not a good writer, people might think you're not smart because of that.  it's not just about gender, it's about where you come from and how you speak.",
            "So, I wanted to clarify how the law has changed on this issue. They've made some changes, apparently decriminalizing it, which means it's not as serious of an offense as it used to be. It's more like getting a traffic ticket, where you might get fined, but you won't be arrested and charged like before. Now, I know some people might worry about the future consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized - it can still impact things like job interviews and other opportunities. On the other hand, there's a argument that arresting people, prosecuting them, and putting them through the system is really expensive. When you think about it, it adds up - arresting, booking, housing them, and then going through the court process, just to let them go. Plus, there's the cost of appointing a public defender, paying the judge, and having the state attorney's office handle the case. It all adds up, and it's not a small expense.\n\nIn places that are struggling financially, some officials might not be willing to make this change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things. But in cities like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize marijuana. I think it's a good idea because it can free up funds for things like education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not just about making marijuana freely available; it's about the financial benefits and the potential to use that money for good.\n\nOf course, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available. Some people might worry that it would be too easily accessible, like cigarettes sold in gas stations. That could lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem. Marijuana is still stigmatized in many places, and having it out in the open might make people uncomfortable. \n\nI think in general, alcohol has more severe effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. However, it's hard to make generalizations because everyone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle them well, while others struggle with moderation. It's complex, and it's hard to make blanket statements about marijuana or any other substance.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with certain aspects of the Catholic Church, but I also see some inconsistency in their practices. They've maintained many traditions over time, which is good, but it's also essential to be open to change. On one hand, I think it's beneficial to draw from the past, but on the other hand, it's frustrating when it seems like the Church is inflexible and judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine precisely.\n\nFor instance, many Catholics believe in attending mass regularly, and they can be quite strict about how things are done. I feel that the Church sometimes looks down on people who don't conform to their expectations, and they also tend to be exclusive towards those with different faiths.\n\nMy personal experience with this is that my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's non-Catholic background. This didn't really demonstrate tolerance for other faiths, which is a core Catholic teaching – to love others. However, the Church's actions often seem hypocritical in this regard.\n\nI'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue, and I think people who engage in such acts would do so regardless of their marital status. It's not like having a spouse would somehow magically prevent them from harming children. So, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a solution to this problem.",
            "Well, I'm still undecided on this issue, but I think it's one of the most difficult topics we're dealing with right now. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a big part of it, and defining marriage in a way that doesn't offend anyone is a challenge in itself. I'm not sure if I think marriage should be viewed as a sacrament by the government or just a civil union between two people. If it's the former, then people might not get tax breaks or any special treatment if they're baptized, which seems unfair. On the other hand, if we view it as a civil union, then the government shouldn't be concerned with the details of the marriage, like whether it's a church wedding or not. It's just about two people who have committed to each other.\n\nIf that's the case, then the fact that gay couples can't get married because of the term \"marriage\" seems ridiculous. It's just a matter of two people getting a civil union, and that's it. If all the states could come to a sense of reason on this issue, then it should become a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a bit much. It's not a huge issue that should warrant changing the constitution. It's not important enough to amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that simple.",
            "I come from a Christian background, so I've always viewed homosexuality as a somewhat complex issue. Having a large circle of gay friends has made me think more deeply about it. While I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I think it's a matter that individual states should decide on their own, rather than relying on a national decision. This is because many states have different political leanings – some are more democratic, while others are more republican. If you live in a state with a democratic government, it's likely that they'll support gay marriage, and it's hard to disagree with their decision when you chose to live there. My stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so each state should have the freedom to decide on legalization based on their own values. I think it's unfair for the president to impose a blanket ban on gay marriage across the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his call to decide how each state should govern itself. Plus, he'll be out of office soon, and future presidents will likely have their own views on the matter. It's better to let individual states make their own decisions, as they'll have to live with the consequences. They're the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision, not the president.",
            "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I completely disagree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor a site like Myspace. Let me explain why. Myspace is a public platform, and as such, it's a place where users share content for anyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to understand that it's going to be viewed by others, including school officials. Even if you're not using the school's name, they could still access it from their homes.\n\nIn this case, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. The school system's primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of its students, and if that means checking out student activity on Myspace, then so be it. It's not an invasion of privacy if it helps prevent harm.\n\nLet's be real, if school officials are going on Myspace specifically to catch students misbehaving, that's a different story. That's an overreach. But if they're doing it to keep students safe, then I think it's a necessary measure. As long as it doesn't infringe on individual rights, I'm okay with it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but when you're talking, it's a bit more challenging. Let me try to clarify. If you post something on Myspace and expect not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Everything you post online is public, and it can come back to haunt you.\n\nThink about it like this: if you're a college student and you say something questionable in an email, it's going to follow you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. It's not like you can just erase it. If you're going to post something online, be prepared for the consequences.\n\nIn my opinion, students shouldn't be worried about school officials going on Myspace to catch them misbehaving. But if it leads to making the school system safer, then that's a different story. Other officials, like the police, should be allowed to monitor it too.\n\nWhen parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment. That's what school officials are trying to ensure. They're not just being nosy; they're trying to prevent something like a school shooting from happening. We had lockdown drills in my high school, and it was to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nIt's the same principle here. The school officials were doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. They were making the school a safer place, and that's something we should appreciate.\n\nThat's my take on it. I don't have much more to add.",
            "I've been hesitant to share my thoughts on the war, partly because I was personally affected by 9/11. At first, I was on board with the idea of going over there and making our presence known, but as time went on, I began to see the bigger picture. I think we rushed into the situation without a thorough plan, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's done anything meaningful, and I believe that as long as the people over there are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. But, unfortunately, 9/11 changed my perspective, and I've become somewhat apathetic towards their struggles. I sometimes feel like they're not even human, the way they wage war, and it's like they're not really trying to better their country. I think they just want us out, and that's it.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we went into this war with a lot of emotional baggage and a desire for revenge. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, at the time, somewhat understandable. We couldn't just let the attack go unpunished, but I do think we could have come up with a better plan. There was a lack of unity and a clear direction, which made things worse.\n\nIt's my honest opinion that we're not the ones to change those people. They're always going to be the way they are, and I don't think we're making enough progress to justify staying there. In fact, I believe that once we leave, everything will collapse, and we'll just be causing harm to ourselves by prolonging our stay. We can't stay there indefinitely, so it's better to just pull out and focus on our own issues."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Honestly, I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes to stay relevant.  I think one reason people are losing interest in the Church is because it isn't very open-minded when it comes to certain issues.  They have rigid views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are outdated in many ways.  If they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, I don't think they'd be worried about losing followers. \n\nI've heard many people are turning against the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues.  People are starting to disagree with them on these topics, and that's causing some to question the Church's views.  They feel the Church is out of touch with modern values.  For example, if you support abortion rights, you might not feel comfortable being part of a community that sees it as morally wrong.  Similarly, if you're in favor of gay marriage, you might not want to be part of a group that disapproves of it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or have priests who are married.  It's not clear if that would have prevented scandals like the ones we've seen, but it's an idea worth considering.  It's hard to say whether allowing married priests or women priests would have made a difference, but it's worth exploring.  It's worth noting that other jobs involve balancing work and personal life – why can't priests do the same?\n\nThe Church views priests as married to God, devoted to a life of service.  However, most people in the world have a job and a family life, and they manage to balance both.  So, I don't see why priests can't have both a career and a family.",
            "to be honest, i'm a bit hesitant to express my thoughts on the topic of gay marriage. let me just say that personally, i don't have an issue with it - i think people should be free to live their lives however they choose. it's not something that i think is a conscious choice, and if someone is born with a certain orientation, i don't think they should be held accountable for it. it doesn't sit right with me to think that a couple of the same sex shouldn't be allowed to get married just because of their orientation.\n\ni think the key thing is that people are born the way they are, whether they're straight, gay, or whatever. it's not something that can be changed, and i don't think it's fair to judge someone for it. so, in my opinion, it's just wrong to deny people the right to get married based on their orientation.\n\ni'm not sure if i've really given this topic much thought, but i think it's clear to me that it's not about making a choice, it's about being who you are. and i don't think the federal government should be involved in making decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nit's just not their place to dictate how people live their lives, especially when it's something as fundamental as who they can marry. it's not a matter of national security or morality, it's just a matter of letting people be themselves. and if that means a same-sex couple wants to get married, then that's their choice, not the government's.\n\nanyway, that's my two cents on the matter. i'm not sure if i've made myself clear, but i think it's pretty simple - people should be free to live their lives as they see fit, and the government should stay out of it.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's really no valid reason not to. The argument that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is just not convincing, considering the complexity of the issue. It's like comparing apples and oranges - they're two distinct entities that can't be reduced to simple opposition. The fact is, gay couples have the same fundamental rights as straight couples, including property rights and access to healthcare, which are essential for ensuring the well-being of all individuals.\n\nHowever, when it comes to healthcare, gay couples often face unique challenges. For instance, their partners may not be recognized as family members, even if they're in a long-term committed relationship, which can limit their access to care and support. This seems unreasonable, especially considering the importance of having a supportive partner during times of illness.\n\nResearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of forming stable and fulfilling relationships as straight couples. They share similar relationship dynamics, and their relationships are just as likely to succeed. The trouble is that many people are hung up on the idea that gay marriage is somehow against their religious beliefs or moral code. But if we're talking about a civil union, a legal document issued by the government, then what's the issue? It's not about church and state; it's about recognizing the rights of all citizens.\n\nThe concept of segregation, where certain groups are treated unequally, is a major concern here. It's similar to the old days of \"separate but equal,\" which we've learned is fundamentally unfair. Gay couples are not asking for the right to get married in a church; they're seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document that recognizes their commitment to each other.\n\nPeople worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and prejudices. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted as those raised by straight parents. The real issue is how society treats these children, not their parents' sexual orientation. In fact, many schools and communities are working to create inclusive environments for these children, acknowledging that they deserve the same love, support, and respect as any other child.\n\nThe federal government should take a more prominent role in ensuring that gay marriage is recognized and protected nationwide. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is a step in the wrong direction, as it would impose a narrow, religious-based view on the entire country. This would be hypocritical, considering the recent controversy over the \"under God\" debate and the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are opposed to gay marriage due to misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or a personality defect. However, organizations like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based research over personal opinions and cultural norms. If we listened more to institutions that conduct rigorous studies and less to popular opinion, we might gain a more nuanced understanding of these issues.",
            "Alright, so here's the thing, I work at the hospital pharmacy over the summer, and let's be real, just because a drug is outlawed doesn't mean it can't have some benefits. I'm saying no to making it available to the general public, no way, but using it for medicinal purposes? That's a different story. We use loads of controlled substances in pharmacies, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, and they're super beneficial. So, just because marijuana is taboo doesn't mean we should deny its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not like these other controlled substances, either. If you abuse marijuana, it's not the same as abusing alcohol, which can lead to serious issues. It's a tough call, but I think we should allow it gradually, not all at once, because that would just lead to overuse. We need to break down the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might start using it responsibly.\n\nThe issue is that people have this awful image of marijuana in their heads, which isn't entirely fair. It's not like heroin or cocaine; it's not that bad for you. If we can change that image, people might start using it for medical purposes, and who knows, responsibly.",
            "i think the church has made an effort to adapt to modern times, but it's still not the strict institution it used to be.  growing up, i was a regular at church every sunday, dressing up in cute outfits, matching shoes, and a purse.  it was part of my routine, especially since i attended a private school where i saw my friends every weekend.  but over time, the church has changed, introducing a teenager mass that's just 30 minutes long and allowing more casual attire, even for the morning masses.  during the summer, people often show up in beachwear, and families often rush in late.  it's become a more relaxed atmosphere, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of traditional church clothes.  while it's nice to see a more casual approach, it's still the church i know.  as for the church's internal politics, i'm not well-versed on the details, but that's my general observation.\n\nregarding the accusations of pedophilia within the catholic church, i think these issues could've been avoided regardless of the church's policies on female priests or married priests.  in my opinion, pedophilia is more of a personal issue, and it's the individual's choice to become a priest.  there are already married men who become pedophiles, so allowing them to get married wouldn't necessarily solve the problem.  i also think that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's a personal decision, and they should consider a faith that allows them to be married if that's what they want.\n\nto elaborate, i think pedophilia is more of a genetic issue than something someone develops due to their environment.  while upbringing might play a small role, i believe it's largely based on genetics.  you can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and it's unlikely they'll be able to hide their true nature.  if the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a different matter altogether.  however, i don't think they necessarily knew about every case.  overall, i don't have any other thoughts on the catholic church beyond this.",
            "I'll be honest, my initial take on the whole situation was quite acceptable, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and the invasion of Iraq was largely a pretext. I believe the Bush administration initially tried to link the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nTo be frank, the fact that the Bush administration has been so open about lying to the American people really gets my blood boiling. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. That's a huge red flag in my book – it's essentially malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense.\n\nIt seems to me that the administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution and tried to marginalize it since 9/11. They came into office with a clear intention to go to war, and I think the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration's issues with him. On top of that, Bush's true motives seemed to be expanding our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nFrankly, I think it's time to move on, but withdrawing now could lead to a civil war and more casualties. The alternative, which the UN and US are considering, is to form a coalition with neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure that's the best idea either. It'll likely lead to more problems down the line, especially with Iraq's sovereignty being a major issue. The interim government is essentially falling apart, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control over the situation. Even Mugtada al-Sadr's party holds a significant amount of power, and we're still dealing with radical elements fighting for control. It's clear the political process is facing a lot of friction due to these factors.\n\nTo be blunt, I don't have any polite words for the whole situation.",
            "i've been wanting to discuss my thoughts about the war in iraq for a while now, but to be honest, it's a really complicated topic for me. i guess you could say i'm still trying to wrap my head around it. one thing that's been on my mind is that it's not even a declared war, which kinda makes it hard to understand our presence over there. i feel like it was more of a retaliatory measure after the 9/11 attacks, and we've been staying in iraq to try and establish a democracy, which sounds great on paper, but it's not that simple. we're also trying to secure oil resources, which isn't a very compelling reason to stay. the problem is, we're just making things worse for everyone involved. if we stay, we'll have to invest a lot of time and money in building a democracy, which is a long-term commitment, and if we leave, the iraqis will be left to pick up the pieces and deal with the aftermath. it's a tough situation, and to be honest, i don't feel like i have a clear answer.\n\ni've been thinking a lot about how we got into this situation and how we can get out of it. one thing that's been on my mind is that we never actually declared war in congress, so it's not even a 'real' war in the eyes of some people. i'm not sure what the point is in staying over there anymore, and it's making our country look bad in the eyes of the world. it's a bit like the vietnam war, which was also undeclared and is now seen as a pointless conflict. our president is getting a bad reputation because of it, and i feel bad for him, but ultimately, it's not just about him - it's about the people who are suffering in iraq.\n\ni know some people have family members fighting over there, and it's hard to say that i want the war to end when i know how much it affects them. but at the same time, i'm worried that our presence is causing more harm than good. we're trying to impose our way of life on the iraqis, which isn't going to work, and it's only going to make them more resentful towards us. the whole al-qaeda thing is just going to get worse, and our efforts to establish a democracy are going to be a long, drawn-out process. i think this conflict is going to drag on for years to come, and i'm not sure what the end result will be.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure if I should even be having this conversation. But here's my take on it: I don't think it's right for a state to make it legal or even declare it as legal. I believe that's a decision that should be left up to the churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and I think trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be a direct defiance of that.\n\nIn my opinion, the people pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in certain areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the US constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. I think any attempt to make an amendment about it would be completely wrong and go against what's already been written. Plus, it would be one of the only amendments that restricts the people rather than the government. I don't think that's right at all.\n\nI don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. It seems to me that the president's push for this amendment is driven by his own personal Catholic beliefs, showing a clear preference for one religion over others. I think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There's no solid reason behind this amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society.\n\nTo be honest, I've said most of what I want to say on the matter.",
            "Okay, so I'm thinking about the war in Iraq and I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. In my opinion, there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, even though they're not closely related. The government played on the emotions of the American people following the 9/11 attacks and used that to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of sorts of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the aftermath of the invasion. A huge number of American soldiers have died, which is absolutely heartbreaking, and the US government wasn't prepared for the power vacuum and chaos that followed.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to establish a democratic one, similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam, but it's a much more complicated process than people initially thought. The government should have known that it would be a long and difficult ordeal, and not a clear-cut victory. In Vietnam, the US fought against an actual army, but in Iraq, they're fighting against citizens, which makes it even harder to put down the insurgency.\n\nI think the government made a mistake by going to war without planning for all possible outcomes, and they weren't prepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. We're still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying, and the US is still trying to train Iraqi troops and police to secure their own country. It's a long process, and I think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a quick and successful mission.\n\nWe shouldn't have underestimated the difficulty of implementing a new form of government, and it's not an easy thing to do, as we can see from our own country's history. The government made it seem like a relatively easy task, but it's not. \n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was weighing my options, and one of my reasons for considering George Bush was to let him finish what he started. However, now that we've been in Iraq for so long, it's hard to justify continuing the war, especially considering the number of American casualties. It's a difficult decision, and I think we should try to see it through, but we also need to consider the astronomical number of casualties and whether it's worth risking more lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIt's also interesting that we're not taking similar actions in other countries, like North Korea, which has weapons of mass destruction, but we're not targeting them. I think the real reason for invading Iraq is the oil issue and controlling resources. Another reason was the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. I don't think the US government is being truthful or thorough enough in its decision-making.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq, but unfortunately, it probably won't be that straightforward.",
            "I'm still trying to figure out where to start with this, but I guess I'll just dive right in: I'm strongly in favor of gay marriage. I've always been, and I'm not really sure why I need to explain it, but I suppose I do. I think it's a deeply personal preference and something that's increasingly being shown to have a biological component, rather than being solely a product of societal influences. This makes it even harder to justify denying people the rights they deserve just because of something they can't control.\n\nI've always believed that it's inhumane to withhold rights based on something that's beyond an individual's control. And, to be honest, I think it's rather hypocritical for politicians and the government to try to dictate what constitutes a marriage. Marriage is a personal, intimate relationship that affects individuals at a deeply personal level, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are a few openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they live their lives just like any other family would - they walk their dogs, go about their daily routines, and contribute to their community in the same ways as everyone else.\n\nIt's just ridiculous that the politicians are trying to impose their own twisted interpretation of marriage on everyone else. Bush's attempt to redefine marriage is nothing short of absurd. I've read and heard from countless credible sources that there's a chemical aspect to being gay, a predisposition that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. This biologically-based aspect is vastly different from sociological factors that might influence someone's choices.\n\nTo me, the most obvious issue with gay marriage is that it's a private matter, not something that should be subject to public scrutiny or federal approval. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it in secret, and it won't make the headlines. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front-page news. I think that's a clear indication that we need to treat marriage as a private, personal issue, rather than a matter of public policy.",
            "Honestly, people often neglect the fact that anything posted online is now public domain. It's completely out in the open, and you can't retract it if you change your mind. As an RA, I've already dealt with this issue firsthand. When you share something, it can shape how others view you, and that's something to consider. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, someone's bound to react. You can't hide that information, and it's not something you can just keep to yourself.\n\nThe internet is a broad platform that everyone can access. If you're friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you'll likely see their bulletin. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin in our case, but someone had access to it and shared it with the authorities. The school has a responsibility to act on potentially threatening situations to prevent harm.\n\nIt's difficult to know what to take seriously when some people post things as jokes or for a sociological experiment. We had a situation at school where someone overheard a comment and reported it. The person's online presence was reviewed, and some of the content they had posted was perceived as serious, even though it might have been intended as a joke.\n\nWhen you post something online, you lose any expectation of privacy. If you don't want people to see it, you shouldn't post it. You can't dictate what others think or take seriously. I don't think it's a good idea for school officials to have social media accounts and be friends with students. However, if something's brought to their attention, they can't ignore it if it poses a potential threat.\n\nI don't think schools should monitor phone conversations, texts, or IMs, but if a student reports a concern, it's a different story. As an RA, I don't even have a Facebook or Myspace account – I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives or see their photos online. It's not my place to know that information, and I certainly don't want the responsibility that comes with it.",
            "Honestly, I think the war has been dragging on for far too long. At the beginning, the idea was to restore democracy in a country that was in dire need of it, but I think we've lost sight of that original purpose a long time ago. It seems like we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world that we're a superpower. \n\nI've always wondered if the motives behind the war were pure to begin with, especially considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If our goal was genuinely to bring democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, that would be a noble cause – as long as it wasn't motivated by personal interests. But I believe that's not the case. The war has dragged on for over a year, and I think we've already made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a powerful statement in itself.\n\nHowever, the fact that it's been going on for years is just ridiculous. If our initial intention was to liberate a country from tyranny, that's a just cause. But I think our reasons have been distorted and misconstrued over time. It seems like we're still fighting just for the sake of fighting, and we don't want to end the war without a clear victory. \n\nI truly believe it's time to bring this war to an end. Our government officials need to take responsibility for their own affairs, and I think that time has come. We've been bleeding our economy dry, spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems to address, like poverty and internal issues that need funding. I think it's a drain on our economy for a cause that's long since been lost.\n\nThe amount of money being spent is staggering – billions and billions of dollars that could be better spent on our own internal problems, like public roads, education, and healthcare. It's disheartening to think that some of our own citizens are being killed in a war that we've lost sight of its purpose. I think that's a tragedy.",
            "I had a question that I wanted to clarify, but I'm not sure where to start. It seems that someone was able to intervene in a situation because they found some information online that was quite revealing.\n\nHonestly, it's pretty much expected that when you post stuff online, especially on sites like Myspace, it's going to be out there for everyone to see. You have to be a member to view someone's profile, but that's because you've essentially given permission for others to see it when you accepted their friend request. So, anytime you put information online, you have to be aware that a lot of people might see it.\n\nI have to admit, in this case, I think it's a good thing that someone was able to see that information and prevent a potentially serious situation. However, I can see why it's tricky. It's not practical or fair to have someone constantly monitoring everyone's profiles just in case. It could be seen as discriminatory if they're only focusing on certain people.\n\nI'm not sure how it would work in practice, but it's all about context. Was someone just browsing randomly or were they actively looking for something specific? If it's the former, it's a bit creepy, but if it's the latter, then maybe it's not such a bad thing.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that there are people out there who could be seeing my information. I recall this one TV show where a guy demonstrated just how easy it is to get information online and use it to meet people. It's unnerving, to say the least. I've had people in my classes who I don't know, but they can figure out who I am and contact me through instant messaging. It's a delicate balance between sharing information and keeping it private.\n\nI've tried to limit what I post online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends and classmates. It's a tough issue because you never know who might be looking at what. My roommate was telling me about how her high school banned Myspace, and it seemed a bit strange. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to do that. It's a complicated situation, and I'm still not entirely sure what to think about it.",
            "i'm having trouble talking about the Iraq War, to be honest, because I feel like I'm jumping on a bandwagon \nI'm hesitant to admit that I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore \nThe general consensus among people, except for those within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea, and I'm inclined to agree \nLooking at the polls - both in the US, Iraq, and globally - it's clear that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a mistake \nIn fact, even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq think it was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year \nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster from the get-go, and it's becoming increasingly clear that pulling out won't be easy either \nI think it's because of the huge cultural divide between the US and the Middle East, and the fact that we're trying to impose democracy in a region where it may not be welcomed \nI mean, Saddam was without a doubt a bad guy, but you can't just invade a country without considering the potential consequences \nIt's like trying to impose Western values on a completely different culture \nI'm still not convinced that there's a good reason for us to stay in Iraq any longer than necessary \nI'm not sure I buy the administration's arguments for why we should stay, and I'm yet to hear a legitimate reason for extending our presence \nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't have a problem with that, but I don't see why we can't just leave now \nIt's clear that the Iraqi people would like us to leave, with around 80% wanting us out within a year and a quarter thinking we should leave immediately \nIt makes sense to me that they might know better than we do, and if we ask them and they say yes, then it's on them if things go wrong \nIf we leave, at least we can say we tried to do the right thing, even if it's not like we'll ever be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East",
            "i think there's still a lot of gender discrimination going on in the US.  i'm not just talking about women, though - it's also about the specific job or field someone's in.  overall, i feel like women have it tougher because there's this concept of a 'glass ceiling' where they're supposed to be equal but in reality, people often have a hard time accepting a woman in charge, even when she's qualified for the job.  it's because of how society's been raised for so long - people are used to men being in charge.  so, women might see a job they're qualified for, but the board won't promote them because it's not common to see women in upper management.  the same thing happens to men in industries like fashion or childcare - it's not common for men to be the primary caregivers, and people look down on them for it.  they're seen as the breadwinners and it's weird if they stay home to take care of the kids.\n\nin fashion, it's even harder for men who are straight because people don't take them seriously.  it's like, if you're a man who's into fashion, people assume you're not really into it because it's not typically something men do.  they think you're just pretending to be like other guys who are into fashion.  it's the same with women in male-dominated fields - people assume they're not really good at it because they're women.\n\nit's hard to change this mindset because society is set in its ways.  we've made progress, but it's slow.  we've come a long way since the 1800s, but it's still a slow process.  women are getting into higher positions and becoming CEOs, which is a good start.  and it's also becoming more acceptable for men to be stay-at-home dads.  but we still have to promote the good qualities of people who are being stereotyped.  we can't just force it, because people will resist.  we're at a good point now where we're starting to see some changes, but it takes time.\n\nanother thing is that people are discriminated against based on where they're from, not just their gender.  like, if you grew up on a farm and you're not a great speaker, but you're super intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, people might look down on you because of your accent.  or if you're a man and you're not a good writer, people might think you're not smart because of that.  it's not just about gender, it's about where you come from and how you speak.",
            "So, I wanted to clarify how the law has changed on this issue. They've made some changes, apparently decriminalizing it, which means it's not as serious of an offense as it used to be. It's more like getting a traffic ticket, where you might get fined, but you won't be arrested and charged like before. Now, I know some people might worry about the future consequences of having a marijuana charge, even if it's decriminalized - it can still impact things like job interviews and other opportunities. On the other hand, there's a argument that arresting people, prosecuting them, and putting them through the system is really expensive. When you think about it, it adds up - arresting, booking, housing them, and then going through the court process, just to let them go. Plus, there's the cost of appointing a public defender, paying the judge, and having the state attorney's office handle the case. It all adds up, and it's not a small expense.\n\nIn places that are struggling financially, some officials might not be willing to make this change, even if it would free up a lot of money for other important things. But in cities like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense to decriminalize marijuana. I think it's a good idea because it can free up funds for things like education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's not just about making marijuana freely available; it's about the financial benefits and the potential to use that money for good.\n\nOf course, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available. Some people might worry that it would be too easily accessible, like cigarettes sold in gas stations. That could lead to people smoking and driving, which is a problem. Marijuana is still stigmatized in many places, and having it out in the open might make people uncomfortable. \n\nI think in general, alcohol has more severe effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a bigger impact on people's lifestyles. However, it's hard to make generalizations because everyone reacts differently to substances. Some people can handle them well, while others struggle with moderation. It's complex, and it's hard to make blanket statements about marijuana or any other substance.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with certain aspects of the Catholic Church, but I also see some inconsistency in their practices. They've maintained many traditions over time, which is good, but it's also essential to be open to change. On one hand, I think it's beneficial to draw from the past, but on the other hand, it's frustrating when it seems like the Church is inflexible and judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine precisely.\n\nFor instance, many Catholics believe in attending mass regularly, and they can be quite strict about how things are done. I feel that the Church sometimes looks down on people who don't conform to their expectations, and they also tend to be exclusive towards those with different faiths.\n\nMy personal experience with this is that my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, couldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's non-Catholic background. This didn't really demonstrate tolerance for other faiths, which is a core Catholic teaching – to love others. However, the Church's actions often seem hypocritical in this regard.\n\nI'm not convinced that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent pedophilic behavior. It's a separate issue, and I think people who engage in such acts would do so regardless of their marital status. It's not like having a spouse would somehow magically prevent them from harming children. So, I don't think allowing priests to be married would be a solution to this problem.",
            "Well, I'm still undecided on this issue, but I think it's one of the most difficult topics we're dealing with right now. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a big part of it, and defining marriage in a way that doesn't offend anyone is a challenge in itself. I'm not sure if I think marriage should be viewed as a sacrament by the government or just a civil union between two people. If it's the former, then people might not get tax breaks or any special treatment if they're baptized, which seems unfair. On the other hand, if we view it as a civil union, then the government shouldn't be concerned with the details of the marriage, like whether it's a church wedding or not. It's just about two people who have committed to each other.\n\nIf that's the case, then the fact that gay couples can't get married because of the term \"marriage\" seems ridiculous. It's just a matter of two people getting a civil union, and that's it. If all the states could come to a sense of reason on this issue, then it should become a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a bit much. It's not a huge issue that should warrant changing the constitution. It's not important enough to amend the constitution just to define or ban gay marriage.\n\nHonestly, I don't think it's that simple.",
            "I come from a Christian background, so I've always viewed homosexuality as a somewhat complex issue. Having a large circle of gay friends has made me think more deeply about it. While I don't entirely agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I think it's a matter that individual states should decide on their own, rather than relying on a national decision. This is because many states have different political leanings – some are more democratic, while others are more republican. If you live in a state with a democratic government, it's likely that they'll support gay marriage, and it's hard to disagree with their decision when you chose to live there. My stance is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, so each state should have the freedom to decide on legalization based on their own values. I think it's unfair for the president to impose a blanket ban on gay marriage across the entire country. Since he doesn't live in every state, it's not his call to decide how each state should govern itself. Plus, he'll be out of office soon, and future presidents will likely have their own views on the matter. It's better to let individual states make their own decisions, as they'll have to live with the consequences. They're the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision, not the president.",
            "I'm not going to sugarcoat it, I completely disagree with the idea that schools shouldn't monitor a site like Myspace. Let me explain why. Myspace is a public platform, and as such, it's a place where users share content for anyone to see. If you post something on the internet, you have to understand that it's going to be viewed by others, including school officials. Even if you're not using the school's name, they could still access it from their homes.\n\nIn this case, if monitoring Myspace helps prevent a school shooting, I think it's perfectly fine. The school system's primary responsibility is to ensure the safety of its students, and if that means checking out student activity on Myspace, then so be it. It's not an invasion of privacy if it helps prevent harm.\n\nLet's be real, if school officials are going on Myspace specifically to catch students misbehaving, that's a different story. That's an overreach. But if they're doing it to keep students safe, then I think it's a necessary measure. As long as it doesn't infringe on individual rights, I'm okay with it.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but when you're talking, it's a bit more challenging. Let me try to clarify. If you post something on Myspace and expect not to get in trouble, that's unrealistic. Everything you post online is public, and it can come back to haunt you.\n\nThink about it like this: if you're a college student and you say something questionable in an email, it's going to follow you. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. It's not like you can just erase it. If you're going to post something online, be prepared for the consequences.\n\nIn my opinion, students shouldn't be worried about school officials going on Myspace to catch them misbehaving. But if it leads to making the school system safer, then that's a different story. Other officials, like the police, should be allowed to monitor it too.\n\nWhen parents drop their kids off at school, they expect it to be a safe environment. That's what school officials are trying to ensure. They're not just being nosy; they're trying to prevent something like a school shooting from happening. We had lockdown drills in my high school, and it was to prepare for worst-case scenarios.\n\nIt's the same principle here. The school officials were doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. They were making the school a safer place, and that's something we should appreciate.\n\nThat's my take on it. I don't have much more to add.",
            "I've been hesitant to share my thoughts on the war, partly because I was personally affected by 9/11. At first, I was on board with the idea of going over there and making our presence known, but as time went on, I began to see the bigger picture. I think we rushed into the situation without a thorough plan, and that's exactly what backfired on us. \n\nNow, I'm strongly against the war. I don't think it's done anything meaningful, and I believe that as long as the people over there are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. But, unfortunately, 9/11 changed my perspective, and I've become somewhat apathetic towards their struggles. I sometimes feel like they're not even human, the way they wage war, and it's like they're not really trying to better their country. I think they just want us out, and that's it.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we went into this war with a lot of emotional baggage and a desire for revenge. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, at the time, somewhat understandable. We couldn't just let the attack go unpunished, but I do think we could have come up with a better plan. There was a lack of unity and a clear direction, which made things worse.\n\nIt's my honest opinion that we're not the ones to change those people. They're always going to be the way they are, and I don't think we're making enough progress to justify staying there. In fact, I believe that once we leave, everything will collapse, and we'll just be causing harm to ourselves by prolonging our stay. We can't stay there indefinitely, so it's better to just pull out and focus on our own issues."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to reassess some of its views and consider adapting to more modern perspectives. It's no secret that the Church has been experiencing a decline in followers, and I think this is partly due to its inflexibility on certain issues. The Church has strong opinions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which might be too outdated for some people. \n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary approach, it might not lose its followers. I've noticed that many people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. Some individuals are starting to disagree with the Church's views on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, which might make them uncomfortable being part of a community that rejects their values.\n\nFor instance, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel at ease being part of a Church that views it as morally wrong. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage or have strong feelings about it might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share their views. I also think that allowing female priests or married priests wouldn't necessarily have prevented the Church's problems. It's uncertain whether this would have made a significant difference.\n\nHowever, I do believe that priests should be allowed to get married. The Church views priests as married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith, but this doesn't seem fair when compared to the rest of the world. Most people have a job and a family life, and I don't see why priests can't have the same balance. It's hypocritical to expect them to dedicate themselves completely to their work while everyone else is allowed to have a personal life.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on something, but I'm having a bit of trouble putting my thoughts into words. Anyway, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously decide on. I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nIt seems to me that it's unfair to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples while allowing opposite-sex couples to have that right. I haven't given it a lot of thought, but it just seems wrong to me. \n\nWhen you think about it, people's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born straight; others are born gay. It's not something they can control or be held responsible for. \n\nI think it's wrong for the government to get involved in matters like this, especially when it's not a matter of national security or moral values. It just seems like they're overstepping their bounds and sticking their noses into people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. They shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nTo be honest, I don't really think the federal government should have any say in the matter. It's not their business, and it's not something that affects the country's security or moral fabric. They're just being intrusive and interfering with people's personal lives. \n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it; it's a tough issue, but I think the government should stay out of it. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.  There's no valid reason not to.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not a fair argument.  It's apples and oranges - two different issues that aren't comparable.  The truth is, there are many aspects of gay relationships that are similar to those of heterosexual couples, and that's what counts.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to basic rights like property taxes and healthcare, a partner in a gay relationship is usually excluded from being present in the hospital or visiting if the other partner is sick.  This is just plain silly, especially given that many gay couples have the same rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.  It's all about the relationship itself, not the sex of the partners.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church; what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.  If the government allows civil unions, why not marriages?  It's segregation by another name - separate but unequal.\n\nThere are also concerns about adoption and community issues, like how gay couples will be perceived by their neighbors and how their children will adjust to society.  However, the truth is that the main drawback is how children are treated by their peers and other adults.  In some areas, like New York City, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nParents who protest to remove these children from their schools are missing the point - parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.  Ultimately, it's about personality choices, not the sexual orientation of the parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state.  The proposed amendment is a bad idea, and President Bush's stance on the issue, which is rooted in his personal religious views, doesn't reflect the views of the majority of Americans.  It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are also opposed to gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect.  However, this is simply not true, as the American Psychological Association has stated.  If we listened to research and studies on the subject instead of popular opinion, we might see things in a different light.",
            "Ugh, fine. I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and you know, just because something's off-limits doesn't mean it has zero redeeming qualities. I mean, take it or leave it, but as far as making it available to the general public, I'm a no. Absolutely not. However, when it comes to using it for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story altogether. It's not like just because something's outlawed, it's automatically useless. You get my point?\n\nAnyway, there are plenty of controlled substances we use at the pharmacy that are technically off-limits, like oxycodone, vicodin, or percs. They're all beneficial, despite being what you might call 'forbidden.' And if we're going to deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because of a social stigma, well, that's a pretty pointless stance in my opinion. I think we should acknowledge its benefits rather than dismissing them out of hand.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's exactly like alcohol in terms of abuse potential, because if you overdo it on marijuana, you might run into problems. But hey, we all know that excessive drinking can lead to some pretty nasty outcomes, too. It's a tough call, but I'd say we could try to approach marijuana legalization in a more gradual way, rather than a 'cold turkey' approach. If we'd just drop the whole taboo surrounding it, people might start using it more responsibly, and that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nPeople have this warped perception of marijuana because of its illicit status, but honestly, it's not like heroine or cocaine or anything else that's really bad for you. So, if we could just rebrand marijuana as something that's not inherently evil, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\nNot my problem, though.",
            "I think the church has definitely adapted to 21st-century standards.  It's not as rigid as it used to be, which I noticed even when I was younger.  For example, I used to go to church every Sunday as a kid, and I would always dress up in cute little outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse.  It was just part of the routine since I attended a private school and saw all my friends there on weekends.  However, as I've grown older, I've noticed that the church has introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually.  In the summer, people often show up in beach clothes, and it's not uncommon to see families rush in late.  Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis.  It's a more relaxed atmosphere, but still respectable.\n\nOne thing that stands out is how casual the church has become.  I don't know the politics behind the church's decisions, but that's my observation.  Moving on to the topic of accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think changing the rules, such as allowing female priests or married priests, would have prevented these incidents.  There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not because of their marital status.  It's an individual issue, and people can be drawn to children regardless of their marital status.\n\nI also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and it's not solely because of the rules that determine whether someone can get married.  In some denominations, like Seventh Heaven's type of faith, clergy are allowed to be married, and it's not a barrier to their faith.  If someone wants to be married and practice their faith, they might consider a different faith that allows it.  I'm not saying it would have made a difference in preventing pedophilia, but it's an alternative option.\n\nTo elaborate on my answer, I think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing.  I don't think it's a matter of choice, and trying to hide it through marriage wouldn't change the underlying issue.  It's a complex topic, and if the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's a different story.  However, I don't think they knew about all the cases.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "I have to admit, I was initially open to the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, and it seems like the invasion of Iraq was a pretext for other underlying reasons. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since become clear that these allegations were false. This really rubs me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still gets under my skin.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been dishonest with the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for its lies. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I think this kind of deceit is a serious offense, especially for a government official, and it's an impeachable crime.\n\nThe Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the Constitution and has been working to erode it since 9/11. It's clear they had a pre-existing intent to go to war, and it's possible that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. The real reason might have been to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to stop the war, but I'm also concerned that withdrawing troops now could lead to civil war and more casualties. The alternative being considered - a coalition of nearby countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia - might not be the best solution, as it would likely lead to more problems in the long run, including issues with Iraq's sovereignty. The current government is already ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the interim government is falling apart, and even the Prime Minister has little control over the situation. The radical elements in Iraq are still vying for power, and the political process is really struggling as a result. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm certainly not sure I can articulate it in polite conversation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not exactly sure where to start with my thoughts on the war in Iraq. To be frank, it all started to feel pointless to me, mainly because it wasn't officially declared as a war by Congress. It feels like we went in there in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq, so it seemed like a way to get back at them. But now, it's hard to keep up with all the details, and I think we're mainly staying there to try to build a democracy and get their oil.\n\nHowever, it's not a good reason to stay, as it's causing a lot of upset. If we stay, we'll have to try to establish a democracy, which will take forever and might even make things worse. On the other hand, if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up and having to start over. It's a tricky situation.\n\nI'm not exactly an expert on this topic, and I'm not sure what to think. I think we should stop calling it a war, though, because it wasn't officially declared as one. We're using force to show our power, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to stay.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources, and I feel bad for President Bush because of how it's turning out. It's making him look like one of the worst presidents in U.S. history, and it's causing a lot of problems for the people of Iraq. The whole Vietnam War thing comes to mind – it was an undeclared war and is now considered pointless. I'm worried that this will be remembered as another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard for me to say that I want the war to end, though, because I know families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. However, the situation there is complicated, and I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into a second U.S. and make things worse. The different groups in Iraq are killing each other over their beliefs, and it's creating an unsafe environment. On the other hand, if we leave, it might allow these groups to grow and create more hatred towards the U.S.\n\nIt's all a bit of a mess, and I think this whole thing will drag on for years to come. I'm not sure what the solution is, but it's a complex issue that needs to be carefully considered.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for a government to make it legal or even declare it as lawful. In my opinion, it's more up to the churches to decide, considering the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that any attempt to enforce authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established in the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we've seen, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't prohibit or permit.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend this would be contradictory to what's already in place and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I strongly disagree with that approach.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why the president is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own Catholic beliefs. By doing so, he's essentially showing a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or the government. There's no valid reason to support this amendment, as it seems to be driven by personal views rather than any tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society.\n\nI think I've covered the main points.",
            "Well, I haven't been posting about my thoughts on the Iraq war, but I think it's time to share my views. To be honest, I'm not convinced that the government was entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it's not that clear-cut. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. The fact that so many American soldiers have died in Iraq is heartbreaking, and it's clear that they were removing the Iraqi government without considering the consequences.\n\nThe US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, leading to chaos and power vacuums that are still ongoing. They're trying to implement a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process. The US government should have known better, given their past experiences, that it wouldn't be a clear-cut victory.\n\nIt's hard to abandon a country once you've intervened, especially when you've taken away their government and way of life. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the cost of keeping troops in Iraq for an extended period make it a difficult decision to continue. If the real reason for invading Iraq was to bring democracy, why not do the same for other countries? I believe the real reasons are more about oil and controlling resources, as evidenced by the lack of action against countries like North Korea, which has admitted to having weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon, and there's peace in the region. However, based on the current situation, it's unlikely.",
            "Okay, so I'm trying to gather my thoughts about gay marriage - something I've been strongly in favor of for a while now. It seems to me that whether someone is gay or straight is largely a matter of personal preference, and studies have increasingly shown that it's linked to biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI don't think the government or politics should have a say in this, it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families. I know of a few openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they're just like any other family - they take care of their daily tasks and live their lives like everyone else. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch has shown that there may be a chemical basis for homosexuality, suggesting it's not something you're born into due to your upbringing or environment. It's a complex issue, but it's clear that biology plays a role. I've read numerous articles and reports that support this idea.\n\nEssentially, it comes down to the fact that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately and quietly, but if two gay people try to do the same, it's a public spectacle. I think marriage should be a personal, private matter, not something subject to public scrutiny or federal regulation.",
            "honestly, i'm not even sure where to start with this \n   when you put something online, it's a public forum - completely open to the public eye \n   as an RA, i've already dealt with this issue firsthand \n   the thing is, once you post something online, you can't control how others will perceive you \n   especially when it comes to sensitive topics like violence or shootings \n   someone's bound to take it seriously and share it with others \n   and once that happens, it's out of your hands \n   the internet is a vast, global platform, and what you post can be seen by anyone \n   if you're connected with that person on social media, they'll likely receive the post \n   in this case, it wasn't the school that received the bulletin - it was someone who overheard something and took it to the authorities \n   they can't just ignore it, as they have a responsibility to act on potential threats \n   the problem is, it can be hard to distinguish between genuine threats and pranks or experiments gone wrong \n   like that one time we had at school, where a student's post was misinterpreted \n   it could be a joke, or it could be a serious warning sign \n   in this particular case, a friend of the person in question checked their social media profile and became concerned about certain posts \n   these posts were initially meant as jokes, but took on a different meaning in light of the situation \n   the thing is, when you post something online, you lose control over who sees it and how they interpret it \n   there's no such thing as true online privacy - if you don't want something out there, don't post it \n   you can't dictate what others think or how they'll react \n   and as for school officials friending students on social media, i don't think that's a good idea \n   they should focus on monitoring situations that are brought to their attention, not constantly scouring social media for potential issues \n   if a student or parent reports something, that's a different story - then the school has a responsibility to investigate \n   but they shouldn't be actively searching through social media accounts without a legitimate reason \n   as an RA, i can attest to this - it's not my job to police my residents' online activities, and i don't want to know about them if i can help it \n   that's why i wouldn't friend them on social media - it's not my place to know that kind of information",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for way too long. Initially, I believed the purpose was sound - to bring democracy to a country without a fair system. But over time, it seems we've lost sight of that goal. It's possible we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world we're a superpower. My concern is that the original motivations may have been suspect, given George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the war's purpose was truly to bring democracy, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective within the first few months. The fact that the war has been ongoing for years, draining our resources and lives, makes it far too prolonged.\n\nI genuinely believe our original purpose was noble, and that's why I initially supported the war. Unfortunately, I think our reasons have become distorted and misguided. It seems we're now fighting for the sake of war itself, rather than for a meaningful outcome. We don't want to end the war without a clear victory, but I think that time has passed.\n\nThe war has dragged on for far too long, and it's time to bring it to a close. The Iraqi government will have to fend for itself eventually, and I believe that time has come. We're diverting billions of dollars from our economy, which could be better spent on domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. These problems are far more pressing and deserving of our attention.\n\nIt's alarming to see our money being spent on a war that's lost its original purpose. We have our own internal struggles to address, and it's not wise to prioritize a foreign conflict over our own domestic challenges. The lives of our own citizens are being lost in this conflict, and it's time to reassess our priorities.\n\nThat's my take on the situation.",
            "I wanted to ask a question to clear something up. I understand that someone on the internet found that there was a reason for something not happening, but I'm not sure what that reason was. \n\nOn sites like Myspace, you know, you can share a lot of information about yourself, and that information is available to anyone who can view your profile. Even if you need someone else to be a member to see your profile, you've essentially given them permission to see it by accepting them as a friend. So, it's kind of like you have to expect that a lot of people will see whatever you put on the internet.\n\nI think it's actually a good thing that someone saw something that might have prevented a life from being lost, though. I can understand why it might be tough for someone to monitor all of the profiles on a school's Myspace, but it's not really fair to single out certain students based on their online activity. It's a tricky situation because you can't just have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles, but at the same time, it's not right to discriminate against certain people.\n\nI don't really know how to balance it all out. I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see things about me that I might not want them to see. I've seen this guy on TV who was trying to show how easy it is for people to get information about others online, and it's kind of scary. He got a girl's screen name in just a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. I wouldn't meet with someone I didn't know in person, but I do have people in my classes who know my screen name and can contact me. It's hard to know who's really looking at your information and what they're doing with it.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but at the same time, I don't want to limit it too much because I use it to communicate with friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. I only accept people I know as friends, but I'm not really sure who else can see my information. My roommate was telling me about a time when her high school banned students from having Myspace, and I wasn't really sure how the school officials had the right to make that decision.",
            "I'm hesitant to bring up the Iraq War again, but I feel like it's worth discussing one more time. To be honest, I'm not sure I should be joining the chorus of people who claim they were against the war from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The majority of people everywhere, including the administration, have realized that the war was a bad idea. If we look at recent polls, it's clear that the overwhelming consensus is that the war was a mistake. In fact, polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a bad idea. Even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, around 70%, believe that the war was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. It's little wonder, considering the war has been a disaster from the start. The issue is that there's a huge cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern nations, making it difficult for the US to understand the local culture. The idea that we can impose democracy on a region where it may not be the preferred system is simplistic and misguided. While Saddam was undoubtedly a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. The situation in Iraq has become like quicksand, and I'm not sure what to say about it. Honestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq. I'm skeptical of the administration's claims that staying is beneficial and that problems will arise if we withdraw. I'm yet to hear a legitimate argument for why we should remain in Iraq beyond what's necessary to ensure a safe withdrawal. If the administration wants to pull out gradually, I'm not opposed to that. However, I don't see a compelling reason for us to stay any longer than necessary. What's striking is that, according to statistics, around 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective, and it's possible that they know better than us. By asking them if we should leave and they say yes, we can avoid being blamed if things go wrong. If we do decide to help after that, at least we'll be seen as the good guys – well, as good as we can be in the Middle East.",
            "To be honest, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. I mean, it's not just about women, though. I believe it's more about the specific field someone works in. For instance, even in industries where equality is supposed to be the norm, it can be tough for people to overcome the ingrained biases that have been built up over time. Think about it: most people still struggle to see past the \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from working under a woman. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long, perpetuating the idea that men are the ones in charge.\n\nAs a result, women often feel like they have to work twice as hard to prove themselves. They might have all the qualifications for a promotion, but if they're not part of the traditional upper echelons of a company, they might not get the nod. It's the same issue in other industries, like fashion or caregiving. It's rare to see men taking on the role of primary caregiver, and when they do, society often frowns upon it. People assume that men should be the breadwinners, not the ones staying home with the kids.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's even more complicated. If a man is interested in fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume he's not a \"real\" fashion expert. I mean, typically men who are into fashion have a certain style, and if someone who doesn't fit that mold tries to join the industry, people might wonder if they really know what they're talking about.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though. People from different backgrounds can face discrimination too. For example, if someone grew up on a farm and didn't have the best education, but they're intelligent and work their way up to a high-level position, others might doubt their abilities because of their background. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you speak. So, I think that depending on the field and the individual, there's definitely still a lot of gender (and other forms of) discrimination in the US.\n\nChanging this is tough, though. Society has a set mindset, and it's hard to shift away from that. We've made progress, obviously - women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world - but it's a slow process. As people see more women in leadership positions and stay-at-home dads becoming more common, they're starting to accept it more. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, but change takes time, and we've come a long way already.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it completely legal, but rather decriminalized it. Decriminalization essentially downgrades it from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket - something you get cited for, rather than arrested and booked. This is a big deal for people, especially when it comes to job interviews and other future endeavors, because it's the worst part of having a drug charge. \n\nHowever, there's an argument that it's expensive to arrest and prosecute people, and then let them go. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and have them appear in court multiple times. Plus, there's the cost of public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office. For cash-strapped municipalities, it's hard to justify this expense, even if it would free up money for other important programs. \n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, seems to be okay with decriminalization. They might actually have more money to spend on things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless now. It's a big deal because marijuana isn't something you want to see everywhere, for a variety of reasons. There's a financial element to consider, as well as societal factors. \n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could become like cigarettes - sold in gas stations and consumed everywhere. Some people might be worried about it being a major issue, especially with driving and smoking. It's still taboo in many places, and having it out in the open like that could be awkward for a lot of people. \n\nAlcohol has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. It's hard to generalize about substances, because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, while others can't. It's complicated, and I think both substances have their own set of problems.",
            "I'd have to agree \nThe thing is, a lot of the methods they use have been around for ages \nThey stick to traditional practices, which is good in some ways \nBut it's also essential to be open to change \nMany people within the Catholic Church believe in attending church services every week \nHowever, the Church can be pretty strict about how things are done \nSometimes, it seems like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow their doctrine to the letter \nThey also don't always accept those who don't share their exact beliefs \nFor instance, my parents were both raised in different Christian denominations, and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's background \n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church teaches the importance of loving others, but then doesn't always put that into practice \nThis can come across as hypocritical when you consider their stance on other religions \nI think it's a matter of outdated doctrine that contradicts the actual practice \nThey continue to stick with the old ways, even if they're no longer relevant \n\nI don't think being allowed to marry would necessarily change the behavior of priests who engage in pedophilia \nAs I see it, the issue lies in the power dynamic between the priest and the child, not in their marital status \nIt's not like someone who would abuse a child would suddenly change their ways just because they're married \n\nThose who abuse children tend to do so regardless of their marital status \nIt's the relationship between the abuser and the victim that's the problem, not their marital situation \nSo, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these issues from occurring",
            "I'm still weighing my thoughts on this complex issue, and to be honest, I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong yet. The debate surrounding the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a real brain-twister. It's a delicate matter, and I can see why people might get tripped up trying to navigate it without offending anyone.\n\nFor me, the question of whether marriage should be defined by the government is a tough one. Marriage is often considered a sacred institution, and yet, people who get married don't necessarily receive special treatment from the government just because of their faith. If two people get baptized, for instance, they don't automatically receive tax breaks or other government benefits. It's a similar situation with marriage - it's essentially a civil union, a union between two consenting adults.\n\nI think the government should just focus on recognizing civil unions, rather than trying to define what kind of marriage they are. After all, it's about two individuals coming together in a commitment to each other, not about the specific details of their relationship. The fact that same-sex couples are seeking the same rights as everyone else is a no-brainer - they're just looking for a civil union, just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement on this, it should be made a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a cause that's not significant enough to warrant changing the constitution. The constitution should only be amended for truly fundamental reasons, not for something that affects a relatively small group of people.\n\nTo put it simply, banning gay marriage isn't worth amending the constitution. I'm afraid I'm not on board with that idea.",
            "to be honest, i was raised in a conservative christian household, and as such, homosexuality has always been somewhat of a complicated issue for me.  i have a lot of gay friends, which has definitely broadened my perspective, but at the same time, i still don't fully agree with that lifestyle choice.  however, i do think it should be legalized, but not because it's a federal issue.  i believe it should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves.  after all, different states have different political leanings - some are more liberal, while others are more conservative.  if you're living in a state that leans democratic, it's likely that they'll push for gay marriage, and if you're not comfortable with that, perhaps you should consider moving to a state with different values.  still, i think that people of all orientations should have the same rights and opportunities, so i think it should be legalized state-by-state. \n\nas for the federal government, i don't think it's right for the president to impose their views on the entire country.  take bush, for example - just because he's in office, it doesn't mean he gets to dictate how every state should handle gay marriage.  that's a decision for the states to make, not the president.  and let's be real, he'll be out of office in a few years, so it's not like he'll have to live with the consequences of his decisions.  in the end, i think each state should be free to make their own decisions, without the president's interference.",
            "Honestly, I'd love to dive into this topic, but to be honest, I'm not quite sure where to start. Myspace, as a public platform, is essentially a bulletin board for people to share their thoughts and experiences with others. If you consider that definition, it's pretty clear that anything posted online is visible to the public, including school officials. Whether or not they're accessing it under the school's name, they could still find it through their personal computers at home.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials use online platforms like Myspace to prevent potential threats, such as school shootings, then I think it's perfectly reasonable. After all, it's their responsibility to ensure student safety, and if that means monitoring online activity, then so be it. I mean, think about it - if they're checking the internet to see if students are engaging in activities they shouldn't be, they're doing it specifically to prevent trouble and catch potential issues.\n\nNow, I'm not saying I agree with the idea of invading students' privacy, but if it saves lives and makes the school a safer place, then I'm okay with it. It's not like they're snooping through personal emails or messages; they're just looking at public content. And let's be real, once something's online, it's there forever, so it's not like you can take it back.\n\nI think it's pretty ridiculous for students to expect to post whatever they want online without facing any consequences. I mean, we're all worried about saying something we might regret in an email or message, aren't we? And even if we think we're anonymous, there's always a chance that someone will see it and use it against us.\n\nIt's a bit like this: if you do something in college that gets you into trouble later on, there's no way to get out of it. Once it's online, it's there forever. And I'm not saying I think it's an invasion of privacy just because school officials are monitoring online activity. I mean, like I said before, it's a public thing.\n\nI'm not saying that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to prevent a school shooting, then that's a different story. It's like what my teacher from public high school told me - they have to ensure the school is safe, and that means monitoring online activity.\n\nIt's kind of like during the terrorist attacks; we had to be safe, so we did lockdown drills and stuff. And while that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's kind of similar. They're just trying to prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's basically all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I've been struggling to express my thoughts on the war, and it's been a long time coming. At first, I was all for it after 9/11, as I was personally affected, and I thought we should go in there and create chaos just like they did here. However, I think we overlooked the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nI believe we went in there unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately backfired. I was initially in favor of the war, but now I'm strongly against it. I don't think it's achieved anything. The people over there are so consumed by their own internal conflicts that they can't even fight us effectively. It's a waste of our time and resources to be there.\n\nTo be honest, I've become somewhat desensitized to what's happening over there due to 9/11. I just don't care about the situation anymore. At times, I find it hard to see the Iraqis as human beings because they're so focused on fighting each other. I think we went in there with a simplistic idea of how to solve their problems, but it's not that easy.\n\nWar is a completely different beast in Iraq than it is for us. They have a much more brutal approach to conflict, and I don't think they're interested in improving their country; they just want us out. I think we should just leave and be done with it.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were more driven by revenge and a desire to \"do something\" after 9/11, rather than thinking through the potential consequences. President Bush seemed to take it upon himself to declare war on Iraq, and I understand where he was coming from, but I don't think we had a choice. However, I do think we could have planned better and had a clearer idea of what we were trying to achieve.\n\nLack of unity and a clear plan have hindered our efforts. We didn't have a clear understanding of what we wanted to accomplish, and we didn't prepare for the aftermath. I think that's what ultimately led to the mess we're in.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the Iraqi people. They've always been that way, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify the cost. I believe we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq, and once we leave, the situation will likely collapse."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq

the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003

um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to reassess some of its views and consider adapting to more modern perspectives. It's no secret that the Church has been experiencing a decline in followers, and I think this is partly due to its inflexibility on certain issues. The Church has strong opinions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which might be too outdated for some people. \n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary approach, it might not lose its followers. I've noticed that many people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. Some individuals are starting to disagree with the Church's views on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, which might make them uncomfortable being part of a community that rejects their values.\n\nFor instance, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel at ease being part of a Church that views it as morally wrong. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage or have strong feelings about it might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share their views. I also think that allowing female priests or married priests wouldn't necessarily have prevented the Church's problems. It's uncertain whether this would have made a significant difference.\n\nHowever, I do believe that priests should be allowed to get married. The Church views priests as married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith, but this doesn't seem fair when compared to the rest of the world. Most people have a job and a family life, and I don't see why priests can't have the same balance. It's hypocritical to expect them to dedicate themselves completely to their work while everyone else is allowed to have a personal life.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on something, but I'm having a bit of trouble putting my thoughts into words. Anyway, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously decide on. I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nIt seems to me that it's unfair to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples while allowing opposite-sex couples to have that right. I haven't given it a lot of thought, but it just seems wrong to me. \n\nWhen you think about it, people's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born straight; others are born gay. It's not something they can control or be held responsible for. \n\nI think it's wrong for the government to get involved in matters like this, especially when it's not a matter of national security or moral values. It just seems like they're overstepping their bounds and sticking their noses into people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. They shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nTo be honest, I don't really think the federal government should have any say in the matter. It's not their business, and it's not something that affects the country's security or moral fabric. They're just being intrusive and interfering with people's personal lives. \n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it; it's a tough issue, but I think the government should stay out of it. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.  There's no valid reason not to.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not a fair argument.  It's apples and oranges - two different issues that aren't comparable.  The truth is, there are many aspects of gay relationships that are similar to those of heterosexual couples, and that's what counts.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to basic rights like property taxes and healthcare, a partner in a gay relationship is usually excluded from being present in the hospital or visiting if the other partner is sick.  This is just plain silly, especially given that many gay couples have the same rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.  It's all about the relationship itself, not the sex of the partners.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church; what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.  If the government allows civil unions, why not marriages?  It's segregation by another name - separate but unequal.\n\nThere are also concerns about adoption and community issues, like how gay couples will be perceived by their neighbors and how their children will adjust to society.  However, the truth is that the main drawback is how children are treated by their peers and other adults.  In some areas, like New York City, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nParents who protest to remove these children from their schools are missing the point - parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.  Ultimately, it's about personality choices, not the sexual orientation of the parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state.  The proposed amendment is a bad idea, and President Bush's stance on the issue, which is rooted in his personal religious views, doesn't reflect the views of the majority of Americans.  It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are also opposed to gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect.  However, this is simply not true, as the American Psychological Association has stated.  If we listened to research and studies on the subject instead of popular opinion, we might see things in a different light.",
            "Ugh, fine. I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and you know, just because something's off-limits doesn't mean it has zero redeeming qualities. I mean, take it or leave it, but as far as making it available to the general public, I'm a no. Absolutely not. However, when it comes to using it for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story altogether. It's not like just because something's outlawed, it's automatically useless. You get my point?\n\nAnyway, there are plenty of controlled substances we use at the pharmacy that are technically off-limits, like oxycodone, vicodin, or percs. They're all beneficial, despite being what you might call 'forbidden.' And if we're going to deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because of a social stigma, well, that's a pretty pointless stance in my opinion. I think we should acknowledge its benefits rather than dismissing them out of hand.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's exactly like alcohol in terms of abuse potential, because if you overdo it on marijuana, you might run into problems. But hey, we all know that excessive drinking can lead to some pretty nasty outcomes, too. It's a tough call, but I'd say we could try to approach marijuana legalization in a more gradual way, rather than a 'cold turkey' approach. If we'd just drop the whole taboo surrounding it, people might start using it more responsibly, and that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nPeople have this warped perception of marijuana because of its illicit status, but honestly, it's not like heroine or cocaine or anything else that's really bad for you. So, if we could just rebrand marijuana as something that's not inherently evil, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\nNot my problem, though.",
            "I think the church has definitely adapted to 21st-century standards.  It's not as rigid as it used to be, which I noticed even when I was younger.  For example, I used to go to church every Sunday as a kid, and I would always dress up in cute little outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse.  It was just part of the routine since I attended a private school and saw all my friends there on weekends.  However, as I've grown older, I've noticed that the church has introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually.  In the summer, people often show up in beach clothes, and it's not uncommon to see families rush in late.  Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis.  It's a more relaxed atmosphere, but still respectable.\n\nOne thing that stands out is how casual the church has become.  I don't know the politics behind the church's decisions, but that's my observation.  Moving on to the topic of accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think changing the rules, such as allowing female priests or married priests, would have prevented these incidents.  There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not because of their marital status.  It's an individual issue, and people can be drawn to children regardless of their marital status.\n\nI also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and it's not solely because of the rules that determine whether someone can get married.  In some denominations, like Seventh Heaven's type of faith, clergy are allowed to be married, and it's not a barrier to their faith.  If someone wants to be married and practice their faith, they might consider a different faith that allows it.  I'm not saying it would have made a difference in preventing pedophilia, but it's an alternative option.\n\nTo elaborate on my answer, I think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing.  I don't think it's a matter of choice, and trying to hide it through marriage wouldn't change the underlying issue.  It's a complex topic, and if the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's a different story.  However, I don't think they knew about all the cases.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "I have to admit, I was initially open to the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, and it seems like the invasion of Iraq was a pretext for other underlying reasons. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since become clear that these allegations were false. This really rubs me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still gets under my skin.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been dishonest with the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for its lies. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I think this kind of deceit is a serious offense, especially for a government official, and it's an impeachable crime.\n\nThe Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the Constitution and has been working to erode it since 9/11. It's clear they had a pre-existing intent to go to war, and it's possible that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. The real reason might have been to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to stop the war, but I'm also concerned that withdrawing troops now could lead to civil war and more casualties. The alternative being considered - a coalition of nearby countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia - might not be the best solution, as it would likely lead to more problems in the long run, including issues with Iraq's sovereignty. The current government is already ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the interim government is falling apart, and even the Prime Minister has little control over the situation. The radical elements in Iraq are still vying for power, and the political process is really struggling as a result. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm certainly not sure I can articulate it in polite conversation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not exactly sure where to start with my thoughts on the war in Iraq. To be frank, it all started to feel pointless to me, mainly because it wasn't officially declared as a war by Congress. It feels like we went in there in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq, so it seemed like a way to get back at them. But now, it's hard to keep up with all the details, and I think we're mainly staying there to try to build a democracy and get their oil.\n\nHowever, it's not a good reason to stay, as it's causing a lot of upset. If we stay, we'll have to try to establish a democracy, which will take forever and might even make things worse. On the other hand, if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up and having to start over. It's a tricky situation.\n\nI'm not exactly an expert on this topic, and I'm not sure what to think. I think we should stop calling it a war, though, because it wasn't officially declared as one. We're using force to show our power, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to stay.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources, and I feel bad for President Bush because of how it's turning out. It's making him look like one of the worst presidents in U.S. history, and it's causing a lot of problems for the people of Iraq. The whole Vietnam War thing comes to mind – it was an undeclared war and is now considered pointless. I'm worried that this will be remembered as another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard for me to say that I want the war to end, though, because I know families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. However, the situation there is complicated, and I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into a second U.S. and make things worse. The different groups in Iraq are killing each other over their beliefs, and it's creating an unsafe environment. On the other hand, if we leave, it might allow these groups to grow and create more hatred towards the U.S.\n\nIt's all a bit of a mess, and I think this whole thing will drag on for years to come. I'm not sure what the solution is, but it's a complex issue that needs to be carefully considered.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for a government to make it legal or even declare it as lawful. In my opinion, it's more up to the churches to decide, considering the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that any attempt to enforce authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established in the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we've seen, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't prohibit or permit.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend this would be contradictory to what's already in place and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I strongly disagree with that approach.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why the president is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own Catholic beliefs. By doing so, he's essentially showing a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or the government. There's no valid reason to support this amendment, as it seems to be driven by personal views rather than any tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society.\n\nI think I've covered the main points.",
            "Well, I haven't been posting about my thoughts on the Iraq war, but I think it's time to share my views. To be honest, I'm not convinced that the government was entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it's not that clear-cut. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. The fact that so many American soldiers have died in Iraq is heartbreaking, and it's clear that they were removing the Iraqi government without considering the consequences.\n\nThe US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, leading to chaos and power vacuums that are still ongoing. They're trying to implement a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process. The US government should have known better, given their past experiences, that it wouldn't be a clear-cut victory.\n\nIt's hard to abandon a country once you've intervened, especially when you've taken away their government and way of life. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the cost of keeping troops in Iraq for an extended period make it a difficult decision to continue. If the real reason for invading Iraq was to bring democracy, why not do the same for other countries? I believe the real reasons are more about oil and controlling resources, as evidenced by the lack of action against countries like North Korea, which has admitted to having weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon, and there's peace in the region. However, based on the current situation, it's unlikely.",
            "Okay, so I'm trying to gather my thoughts about gay marriage - something I've been strongly in favor of for a while now. It seems to me that whether someone is gay or straight is largely a matter of personal preference, and studies have increasingly shown that it's linked to biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI don't think the government or politics should have a say in this, it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families. I know of a few openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they're just like any other family - they take care of their daily tasks and live their lives like everyone else. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch has shown that there may be a chemical basis for homosexuality, suggesting it's not something you're born into due to your upbringing or environment. It's a complex issue, but it's clear that biology plays a role. I've read numerous articles and reports that support this idea.\n\nEssentially, it comes down to the fact that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately and quietly, but if two gay people try to do the same, it's a public spectacle. I think marriage should be a personal, private matter, not something subject to public scrutiny or federal regulation.",
            "honestly, i'm not even sure where to start with this \n   when you put something online, it's a public forum - completely open to the public eye \n   as an RA, i've already dealt with this issue firsthand \n   the thing is, once you post something online, you can't control how others will perceive you \n   especially when it comes to sensitive topics like violence or shootings \n   someone's bound to take it seriously and share it with others \n   and once that happens, it's out of your hands \n   the internet is a vast, global platform, and what you post can be seen by anyone \n   if you're connected with that person on social media, they'll likely receive the post \n   in this case, it wasn't the school that received the bulletin - it was someone who overheard something and took it to the authorities \n   they can't just ignore it, as they have a responsibility to act on potential threats \n   the problem is, it can be hard to distinguish between genuine threats and pranks or experiments gone wrong \n   like that one time we had at school, where a student's post was misinterpreted \n   it could be a joke, or it could be a serious warning sign \n   in this particular case, a friend of the person in question checked their social media profile and became concerned about certain posts \n   these posts were initially meant as jokes, but took on a different meaning in light of the situation \n   the thing is, when you post something online, you lose control over who sees it and how they interpret it \n   there's no such thing as true online privacy - if you don't want something out there, don't post it \n   you can't dictate what others think or how they'll react \n   and as for school officials friending students on social media, i don't think that's a good idea \n   they should focus on monitoring situations that are brought to their attention, not constantly scouring social media for potential issues \n   if a student or parent reports something, that's a different story - then the school has a responsibility to investigate \n   but they shouldn't be actively searching through social media accounts without a legitimate reason \n   as an RA, i can attest to this - it's not my job to police my residents' online activities, and i don't want to know about them if i can help it \n   that's why i wouldn't friend them on social media - it's not my place to know that kind of information",
            "Honestly, I think the war has dragged on for way too long. Initially, I believed the purpose was sound - to bring democracy to a country without a fair system. But over time, it seems we've lost sight of that goal. It's possible we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world we're a superpower. My concern is that the original motivations may have been suspect, given George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the war's purpose was truly to bring democracy, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective within the first few months. The fact that the war has been ongoing for years, draining our resources and lives, makes it far too prolonged.\n\nI genuinely believe our original purpose was noble, and that's why I initially supported the war. Unfortunately, I think our reasons have become distorted and misguided. It seems we're now fighting for the sake of war itself, rather than for a meaningful outcome. We don't want to end the war without a clear victory, but I think that time has passed.\n\nThe war has dragged on for far too long, and it's time to bring it to a close. The Iraqi government will have to fend for itself eventually, and I believe that time has come. We're diverting billions of dollars from our economy, which could be better spent on domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. These problems are far more pressing and deserving of our attention.\n\nIt's alarming to see our money being spent on a war that's lost its original purpose. We have our own internal struggles to address, and it's not wise to prioritize a foreign conflict over our own domestic challenges. The lives of our own citizens are being lost in this conflict, and it's time to reassess our priorities.\n\nThat's my take on the situation.",
            "I wanted to ask a question to clear something up. I understand that someone on the internet found that there was a reason for something not happening, but I'm not sure what that reason was. \n\nOn sites like Myspace, you know, you can share a lot of information about yourself, and that information is available to anyone who can view your profile. Even if you need someone else to be a member to see your profile, you've essentially given them permission to see it by accepting them as a friend. So, it's kind of like you have to expect that a lot of people will see whatever you put on the internet.\n\nI think it's actually a good thing that someone saw something that might have prevented a life from being lost, though. I can understand why it might be tough for someone to monitor all of the profiles on a school's Myspace, but it's not really fair to single out certain students based on their online activity. It's a tricky situation because you can't just have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles, but at the same time, it's not right to discriminate against certain people.\n\nI don't really know how to balance it all out. I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see things about me that I might not want them to see. I've seen this guy on TV who was trying to show how easy it is for people to get information about others online, and it's kind of scary. He got a girl's screen name in just a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. I wouldn't meet with someone I didn't know in person, but I do have people in my classes who know my screen name and can contact me. It's hard to know who's really looking at your information and what they're doing with it.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but at the same time, I don't want to limit it too much because I use it to communicate with friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. I only accept people I know as friends, but I'm not really sure who else can see my information. My roommate was telling me about a time when her high school banned students from having Myspace, and I wasn't really sure how the school officials had the right to make that decision.",
            "I'm hesitant to bring up the Iraq War again, but I feel like it's worth discussing one more time. To be honest, I'm not sure I should be joining the chorus of people who claim they were against the war from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The majority of people everywhere, including the administration, have realized that the war was a bad idea. If we look at recent polls, it's clear that the overwhelming consensus is that the war was a mistake. In fact, polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a bad idea. Even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, around 70%, believe that the war was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. It's little wonder, considering the war has been a disaster from the start. The issue is that there's a huge cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern nations, making it difficult for the US to understand the local culture. The idea that we can impose democracy on a region where it may not be the preferred system is simplistic and misguided. While Saddam was undoubtedly a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. The situation in Iraq has become like quicksand, and I'm not sure what to say about it. Honestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq. I'm skeptical of the administration's claims that staying is beneficial and that problems will arise if we withdraw. I'm yet to hear a legitimate argument for why we should remain in Iraq beyond what's necessary to ensure a safe withdrawal. If the administration wants to pull out gradually, I'm not opposed to that. However, I don't see a compelling reason for us to stay any longer than necessary. What's striking is that, according to statistics, around 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective, and it's possible that they know better than us. By asking them if we should leave and they say yes, we can avoid being blamed if things go wrong. If we do decide to help after that, at least we'll be seen as the good guys – well, as good as we can be in the Middle East.",
            "To be honest, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. I mean, it's not just about women, though. I believe it's more about the specific field someone works in. For instance, even in industries where equality is supposed to be the norm, it can be tough for people to overcome the ingrained biases that have been built up over time. Think about it: most people still struggle to see past the \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from working under a woman. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long, perpetuating the idea that men are the ones in charge.\n\nAs a result, women often feel like they have to work twice as hard to prove themselves. They might have all the qualifications for a promotion, but if they're not part of the traditional upper echelons of a company, they might not get the nod. It's the same issue in other industries, like fashion or caregiving. It's rare to see men taking on the role of primary caregiver, and when they do, society often frowns upon it. People assume that men should be the breadwinners, not the ones staying home with the kids.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's even more complicated. If a man is interested in fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume he's not a \"real\" fashion expert. I mean, typically men who are into fashion have a certain style, and if someone who doesn't fit that mold tries to join the industry, people might wonder if they really know what they're talking about.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though. People from different backgrounds can face discrimination too. For example, if someone grew up on a farm and didn't have the best education, but they're intelligent and work their way up to a high-level position, others might doubt their abilities because of their background. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you speak. So, I think that depending on the field and the individual, there's definitely still a lot of gender (and other forms of) discrimination in the US.\n\nChanging this is tough, though. Society has a set mindset, and it's hard to shift away from that. We've made progress, obviously - women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world - but it's a slow process. As people see more women in leadership positions and stay-at-home dads becoming more common, they're starting to accept it more. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, but change takes time, and we've come a long way already.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it completely legal, but rather decriminalized it. Decriminalization essentially downgrades it from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket - something you get cited for, rather than arrested and booked. This is a big deal for people, especially when it comes to job interviews and other future endeavors, because it's the worst part of having a drug charge. \n\nHowever, there's an argument that it's expensive to arrest and prosecute people, and then let them go. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and have them appear in court multiple times. Plus, there's the cost of public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office. For cash-strapped municipalities, it's hard to justify this expense, even if it would free up money for other important programs. \n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, seems to be okay with decriminalization. They might actually have more money to spend on things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless now. It's a big deal because marijuana isn't something you want to see everywhere, for a variety of reasons. There's a financial element to consider, as well as societal factors. \n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could become like cigarettes - sold in gas stations and consumed everywhere. Some people might be worried about it being a major issue, especially with driving and smoking. It's still taboo in many places, and having it out in the open like that could be awkward for a lot of people. \n\nAlcohol has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. It's hard to generalize about substances, because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, while others can't. It's complicated, and I think both substances have their own set of problems.",
            "I'd have to agree \nThe thing is, a lot of the methods they use have been around for ages \nThey stick to traditional practices, which is good in some ways \nBut it's also essential to be open to change \nMany people within the Catholic Church believe in attending church services every week \nHowever, the Church can be pretty strict about how things are done \nSometimes, it seems like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow their doctrine to the letter \nThey also don't always accept those who don't share their exact beliefs \nFor instance, my parents were both raised in different Christian denominations, and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's background \n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church teaches the importance of loving others, but then doesn't always put that into practice \nThis can come across as hypocritical when you consider their stance on other religions \nI think it's a matter of outdated doctrine that contradicts the actual practice \nThey continue to stick with the old ways, even if they're no longer relevant \n\nI don't think being allowed to marry would necessarily change the behavior of priests who engage in pedophilia \nAs I see it, the issue lies in the power dynamic between the priest and the child, not in their marital status \nIt's not like someone who would abuse a child would suddenly change their ways just because they're married \n\nThose who abuse children tend to do so regardless of their marital status \nIt's the relationship between the abuser and the victim that's the problem, not their marital situation \nSo, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these issues from occurring",
            "I'm still weighing my thoughts on this complex issue, and to be honest, I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong yet. The debate surrounding the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a real brain-twister. It's a delicate matter, and I can see why people might get tripped up trying to navigate it without offending anyone.\n\nFor me, the question of whether marriage should be defined by the government is a tough one. Marriage is often considered a sacred institution, and yet, people who get married don't necessarily receive special treatment from the government just because of their faith. If two people get baptized, for instance, they don't automatically receive tax breaks or other government benefits. It's a similar situation with marriage - it's essentially a civil union, a union between two consenting adults.\n\nI think the government should just focus on recognizing civil unions, rather than trying to define what kind of marriage they are. After all, it's about two individuals coming together in a commitment to each other, not about the specific details of their relationship. The fact that same-sex couples are seeking the same rights as everyone else is a no-brainer - they're just looking for a civil union, just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement on this, it should be made a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a cause that's not significant enough to warrant changing the constitution. The constitution should only be amended for truly fundamental reasons, not for something that affects a relatively small group of people.\n\nTo put it simply, banning gay marriage isn't worth amending the constitution. I'm afraid I'm not on board with that idea.",
            "to be honest, i was raised in a conservative christian household, and as such, homosexuality has always been somewhat of a complicated issue for me.  i have a lot of gay friends, which has definitely broadened my perspective, but at the same time, i still don't fully agree with that lifestyle choice.  however, i do think it should be legalized, but not because it's a federal issue.  i believe it should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves.  after all, different states have different political leanings - some are more liberal, while others are more conservative.  if you're living in a state that leans democratic, it's likely that they'll push for gay marriage, and if you're not comfortable with that, perhaps you should consider moving to a state with different values.  still, i think that people of all orientations should have the same rights and opportunities, so i think it should be legalized state-by-state. \n\nas for the federal government, i don't think it's right for the president to impose their views on the entire country.  take bush, for example - just because he's in office, it doesn't mean he gets to dictate how every state should handle gay marriage.  that's a decision for the states to make, not the president.  and let's be real, he'll be out of office in a few years, so it's not like he'll have to live with the consequences of his decisions.  in the end, i think each state should be free to make their own decisions, without the president's interference.",
            "Honestly, I'd love to dive into this topic, but to be honest, I'm not quite sure where to start. Myspace, as a public platform, is essentially a bulletin board for people to share their thoughts and experiences with others. If you consider that definition, it's pretty clear that anything posted online is visible to the public, including school officials. Whether or not they're accessing it under the school's name, they could still find it through their personal computers at home.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials use online platforms like Myspace to prevent potential threats, such as school shootings, then I think it's perfectly reasonable. After all, it's their responsibility to ensure student safety, and if that means monitoring online activity, then so be it. I mean, think about it - if they're checking the internet to see if students are engaging in activities they shouldn't be, they're doing it specifically to prevent trouble and catch potential issues.\n\nNow, I'm not saying I agree with the idea of invading students' privacy, but if it saves lives and makes the school a safer place, then I'm okay with it. It's not like they're snooping through personal emails or messages; they're just looking at public content. And let's be real, once something's online, it's there forever, so it's not like you can take it back.\n\nI think it's pretty ridiculous for students to expect to post whatever they want online without facing any consequences. I mean, we're all worried about saying something we might regret in an email or message, aren't we? And even if we think we're anonymous, there's always a chance that someone will see it and use it against us.\n\nIt's a bit like this: if you do something in college that gets you into trouble later on, there's no way to get out of it. Once it's online, it's there forever. And I'm not saying I think it's an invasion of privacy just because school officials are monitoring online activity. I mean, like I said before, it's a public thing.\n\nI'm not saying that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to prevent a school shooting, then that's a different story. It's like what my teacher from public high school told me - they have to ensure the school is safe, and that means monitoring online activity.\n\nIt's kind of like during the terrorist attacks; we had to be safe, so we did lockdown drills and stuff. And while that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's kind of similar. They're just trying to prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's basically all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I've been struggling to express my thoughts on the war, and it's been a long time coming. At first, I was all for it after 9/11, as I was personally affected, and I thought we should go in there and create chaos just like they did here. However, I think we overlooked the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nI believe we went in there unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately backfired. I was initially in favor of the war, but now I'm strongly against it. I don't think it's achieved anything. The people over there are so consumed by their own internal conflicts that they can't even fight us effectively. It's a waste of our time and resources to be there.\n\nTo be honest, I've become somewhat desensitized to what's happening over there due to 9/11. I just don't care about the situation anymore. At times, I find it hard to see the Iraqis as human beings because they're so focused on fighting each other. I think we went in there with a simplistic idea of how to solve their problems, but it's not that easy.\n\nWar is a completely different beast in Iraq than it is for us. They have a much more brutal approach to conflict, and I don't think they're interested in improving their country; they just want us out. I think we should just leave and be done with it.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were more driven by revenge and a desire to \"do something\" after 9/11, rather than thinking through the potential consequences. President Bush seemed to take it upon himself to declare war on Iraq, and I understand where he was coming from, but I don't think we had a choice. However, I do think we could have planned better and had a clearer idea of what we were trying to achieve.\n\nLack of unity and a clear plan have hindered our efforts. We didn't have a clear understanding of what we wanted to accomplish, and we didn't prepare for the aftermath. I think that's what ultimately led to the mess we're in.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the Iraqi people. They've always been that way, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify the cost. I believe we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq, and once we leave, the situation will likely collapse."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I genuinely believe that the Catholic Church needs to reassess some of its views and consider adapting to more modern perspectives. It's no secret that the Church has been experiencing a decline in followers, and I think this is partly due to its inflexibility on certain issues. The Church has strong opinions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which might be too outdated for some people. \n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary approach, it might not lose its followers. I've noticed that many people are turning away from the Church because of its stance on these topics. Some individuals are starting to disagree with the Church's views on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, which might make them uncomfortable being part of a community that rejects their values.\n\nFor instance, if someone supports abortion rights, they might not feel at ease being part of a Church that views it as morally wrong. Similarly, those who believe in gay marriage or have strong feelings about it might not want to be part of a community that doesn't share their views. I also think that allowing female priests or married priests wouldn't necessarily have prevented the Church's problems. It's uncertain whether this would have made a significant difference.\n\nHowever, I do believe that priests should be allowed to get married. The Church views priests as married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith, but this doesn't seem fair when compared to the rest of the world. Most people have a job and a family life, and I don't see why priests can't have the same balance. It's hypocritical to expect them to dedicate themselves completely to their work while everyone else is allowed to have a personal life.",
            "I've been meaning to share my thoughts on something, but I'm having a bit of trouble putting my thoughts into words. Anyway, I'm not opposed to the idea of gay marriage. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they can consciously decide on. I believe that gay people shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nIt seems to me that it's unfair to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples while allowing opposite-sex couples to have that right. I haven't given it a lot of thought, but it just seems wrong to me. \n\nWhen you think about it, people's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born straight; others are born gay. It's not something they can control or be held responsible for. \n\nI think it's wrong for the government to get involved in matters like this, especially when it's not a matter of national security or moral values. It just seems like they're overstepping their bounds and sticking their noses into people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are, and it's not something they can change. They shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nTo be honest, I don't really think the federal government should have any say in the matter. It's not their business, and it's not something that affects the country's security or moral fabric. They're just being intrusive and interfering with people's personal lives. \n\nI'm not going to sugarcoat it; it's a tough issue, but I think the government should stay out of it. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.  There's no valid reason not to.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but that's not a fair argument.  It's apples and oranges - two different issues that aren't comparable.  The truth is, there are many aspects of gay relationships that are similar to those of heterosexual couples, and that's what counts.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to basic rights like property taxes and healthcare, a partner in a gay relationship is usually excluded from being present in the hospital or visiting if the other partner is sick.  This is just plain silly, especially given that many gay couples have the same rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.  It's all about the relationship itself, not the sex of the partners.\n\nThe biggest misconception is that gay couples are asking for the right to get married in a church; what they're really asking for is a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.  If the government allows civil unions, why not marriages?  It's segregation by another name - separate but unequal.\n\nThere are also concerns about adoption and community issues, like how gay couples will be perceived by their neighbors and how their children will adjust to society.  However, the truth is that the main drawback is how children are treated by their peers and other adults.  In some areas, like New York City, children of gay parents have to deal with bullying and harassment in public schools.\n\nParents who protest to remove these children from their schools are missing the point - parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.  Ultimately, it's about personality choices, not the sexual orientation of the parents.\n\nThe federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state.  The proposed amendment is a bad idea, and President Bush's stance on the issue, which is rooted in his personal religious views, doesn't reflect the views of the majority of Americans.  It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are also opposed to gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect.  However, this is simply not true, as the American Psychological Association has stated.  If we listened to research and studies on the subject instead of popular opinion, we might see things in a different light.",
            "Ugh, fine. I work at a hospital pharmacy over the summer, and you know, just because something's off-limits doesn't mean it has zero redeeming qualities. I mean, take it or leave it, but as far as making it available to the general public, I'm a no. Absolutely not. However, when it comes to using it for medicinal purposes, I think it's a different story altogether. It's not like just because something's outlawed, it's automatically useless. You get my point?\n\nAnyway, there are plenty of controlled substances we use at the pharmacy that are technically off-limits, like oxycodone, vicodin, or percs. They're all beneficial, despite being what you might call 'forbidden.' And if we're going to deny the potential benefits of marijuana just because of a social stigma, well, that's a pretty pointless stance in my opinion. I think we should acknowledge its benefits rather than dismissing them out of hand.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's exactly like alcohol in terms of abuse potential, because if you overdo it on marijuana, you might run into problems. But hey, we all know that excessive drinking can lead to some pretty nasty outcomes, too. It's a tough call, but I'd say we could try to approach marijuana legalization in a more gradual way, rather than a 'cold turkey' approach. If we'd just drop the whole taboo surrounding it, people might start using it more responsibly, and that would be a step in the right direction.\n\nPeople have this warped perception of marijuana because of its illicit status, but honestly, it's not like heroine or cocaine or anything else that's really bad for you. So, if we could just rebrand marijuana as something that's not inherently evil, I think people would be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.\n\nNot my problem, though.",
            "I think the church has definitely adapted to 21st-century standards.  It's not as rigid as it used to be, which I noticed even when I was younger.  For example, I used to go to church every Sunday as a kid, and I would always dress up in cute little outfits, complete with matching shoes and a purse.  It was just part of the routine since I attended a private school and saw all my friends there on weekends.  However, as I've grown older, I've noticed that the church has introduced a teen mass that's only 30 minutes long, and people dress much more casually.  In the summer, people often show up in beach clothes, and it's not uncommon to see families rush in late.  Even at morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis.  It's a more relaxed atmosphere, but still respectable.\n\nOne thing that stands out is how casual the church has become.  I don't know the politics behind the church's decisions, but that's my observation.  Moving on to the topic of accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think changing the rules, such as allowing female priests or married priests, would have prevented these incidents.  There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not because of their marital status.  It's an individual issue, and people can be drawn to children regardless of their marital status.\n\nI also think that becoming a priest is a personal choice, and it's not solely because of the rules that determine whether someone can get married.  In some denominations, like Seventh Heaven's type of faith, clergy are allowed to be married, and it's not a barrier to their faith.  If someone wants to be married and practice their faith, they might consider a different faith that allows it.  I'm not saying it would have made a difference in preventing pedophilia, but it's an alternative option.\n\nTo elaborate on my answer, I think pedophilia is largely based on genetics, and it's not something people develop due to their upbringing.  I don't think it's a matter of choice, and trying to hide it through marriage wouldn't change the underlying issue.  It's a complex topic, and if the church was aware of the problem and tried to cover it up, that's a different story.  However, I don't think they knew about all the cases.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have anything else to add.",
            "I have to admit, I was initially open to the idea, but I think everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, and it seems like the invasion of Iraq was a pretext for other underlying reasons. The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since become clear that these allegations were false. This really rubs me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still gets under my skin.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration has been dishonest with the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for its lies. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I think this kind of deceit is a serious offense, especially for a government official, and it's an impeachable crime.\n\nThe Bush administration has shown a blatant disregard for the Constitution and has been working to erode it since 9/11. It's clear they had a pre-existing intent to go to war, and it's possible that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration. The real reason might have been to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded way to do things.\n\nI think it's time to stop the war, but I'm also concerned that withdrawing troops now could lead to civil war and more casualties. The alternative being considered - a coalition of nearby countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia - might not be the best solution, as it would likely lead to more problems in the long run, including issues with Iraq's sovereignty. The current government is already ineffective, and the Parliament isn't doing much to help.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the interim government is falling apart, and even the Prime Minister has little control over the situation. The radical elements in Iraq are still vying for power, and the political process is really struggling as a result. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I'm certainly not sure I can articulate it in polite conversation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not exactly sure where to start with my thoughts on the war in Iraq. To be frank, it all started to feel pointless to me, mainly because it wasn't officially declared as a war by Congress. It feels like we went in there in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq, so it seemed like a way to get back at them. But now, it's hard to keep up with all the details, and I think we're mainly staying there to try to build a democracy and get their oil.\n\nHowever, it's not a good reason to stay, as it's causing a lot of upset. If we stay, we'll have to try to establish a democracy, which will take forever and might even make things worse. On the other hand, if we leave, they'll be angry with us for messing things up and having to start over. It's a tricky situation.\n\nI'm not exactly an expert on this topic, and I'm not sure what to think. I think we should stop calling it a war, though, because it wasn't officially declared as one. We're using force to show our power, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to stay.\n\nI do think we should try to help them, but it's also a waste of resources, and I feel bad for President Bush because of how it's turning out. It's making him look like one of the worst presidents in U.S. history, and it's causing a lot of problems for the people of Iraq. The whole Vietnam War thing comes to mind – it was an undeclared war and is now considered pointless. I'm worried that this will be remembered as another meaningless war.\n\nIt's hard for me to say that I want the war to end, though, because I know families who have loved ones in Iraq, and I want them to be safe. However, the situation there is complicated, and I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be trying to mold them into a second U.S. and make things worse. The different groups in Iraq are killing each other over their beliefs, and it's creating an unsafe environment. On the other hand, if we leave, it might allow these groups to grow and create more hatred towards the U.S.\n\nIt's all a bit of a mess, and I think this whole thing will drag on for years to come. I'm not sure what the solution is, but it's a complex issue that needs to be carefully considered.",
            "Honestly, I'm not convinced that it's right for a government to make it legal or even declare it as lawful. In my opinion, it's more up to the churches to decide, considering the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. It's pretty clear that any attempt to enforce authority over it would be a direct defiance of what's already been established in the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing to make it illegal are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over another. As we've seen, most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it's the government's place to decide what the churches can and can't prohibit or permit.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the US. Attempting to amend this would be contradictory to what's already in place and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I strongly disagree with that approach.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why the president is pushing for this amendment, except that it aligns with his own Catholic beliefs. By doing so, he's essentially showing a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or the government. There's no valid reason to support this amendment, as it seems to be driven by personal views rather than any tangible impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society.\n\nI think I've covered the main points.",
            "Well, I haven't been posting about my thoughts on the Iraq war, but I think it's time to share my views. To be honest, I'm not convinced that the government was entirely truthful with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq. I believe they attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, but it's not that clear-cut. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the war, which started in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and I think the government should have learned from their past mistakes. The fact that so many American soldiers have died in Iraq is heartbreaking, and it's clear that they were removing the Iraqi government without considering the consequences.\n\nThe US government wasn't prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, leading to chaos and power vacuums that are still ongoing. They're trying to implement a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they attempted in Vietnam, but it's a long and difficult process. The US government should have known better, given their past experiences, that it wouldn't be a clear-cut victory.\n\nIt's hard to abandon a country once you've intervened, especially when you've taken away their government and way of life. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the cost of keeping troops in Iraq for an extended period make it a difficult decision to continue. If the real reason for invading Iraq was to bring democracy, why not do the same for other countries? I believe the real reasons are more about oil and controlling resources, as evidenced by the lack of action against countries like North Korea, which has admitted to having weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the war in Iraq ends soon, and there's peace in the region. However, based on the current situation, it's unlikely.",
            "Okay, so I'm trying to gather my thoughts about gay marriage - something I've been strongly in favor of for a while now. It seems to me that whether someone is gay or straight is largely a matter of personal preference, and studies have increasingly shown that it's linked to biology rather than societal factors. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI don't think the government or politics should have a say in this, it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families. I know of a few openly gay couples in my neighborhood who aren't married because they're not allowed to be, but they're just like any other family - they take care of their daily tasks and live their lives like everyone else. It's ridiculous that politicians like Bush try to dictate what marriage means and interpret it to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch has shown that there may be a chemical basis for homosexuality, suggesting it's not something you're born into due to your upbringing or environment. It's a complex issue, but it's clear that biology plays a role. I've read numerous articles and reports that support this idea.\n\nEssentially, it comes down to the fact that if a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it privately and quietly, but if two gay people try to do the same, it's a public spectacle. I think marriage should be a personal, private matter, not something subject to public scrutiny or federal regulation.",

But over time, it seems we've lost sight of that goal. It's possible we're now fighting just to prove a point, to show the world we're a superpower. My concern is that the original motivations may have been suspect, given George Bush's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the war's purpose was truly to bring democracy, that would be a justifiable reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective within the first few months. The fact that the war has been ongoing for years, draining our resources and lives, makes it far too prolonged.\n\nI genuinely believe our original purpose was noble, and that's why I initially supported the war. Unfortunately, I think our reasons have become distorted and misguided. It seems we're now fighting for the sake of war itself, rather than for a meaningful outcome. We don't want to end the war without a clear victory, but I think that time has passed.\n\nThe war has dragged on for far too long, and it's time to bring it to a close. The Iraqi government will have to fend for itself eventually, and I believe that time has come. We're diverting billions of dollars from our economy, which could be better spent on domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. These problems are far more pressing and deserving of our attention.\n\nIt's alarming to see our money being spent on a war that's lost its original purpose. We have our own internal struggles to address, and it's not wise to prioritize a foreign conflict over our own domestic challenges. The lives of our own citizens are being lost in this conflict, and it's time to reassess our priorities.\n\nThat's my take on the situation.",
            "I wanted to ask a question to clear something up. I understand that someone on the internet found that there was a reason for something not happening, but I'm not sure what that reason was. \n\nOn sites like Myspace, you know, you can share a lot of information about yourself, and that information is available to anyone who can view your profile. Even if you need someone else to be a member to see your profile, you've essentially given them permission to see it by accepting them as a friend. So, it's kind of like you have to expect that a lot of people will see whatever you put on the internet.\n\nI think it's actually a good thing that someone saw something that might have prevented a life from being lost, though. I can understand why it might be tough for someone to monitor all of the profiles on a school's Myspace, but it's not really fair to single out certain students based on their online activity. It's a tricky situation because you can't just have one person sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles, but at the same time, it's not right to discriminate against certain people.\n\nI don't really know how to balance it all out. I have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people out there who can see things about me that I might not want them to see. I've seen this guy on TV who was trying to show how easy it is for people to get information about others online, and it's kind of scary. He got a girl's screen name in just a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. I wouldn't meet with someone I didn't know in person, but I do have people in my classes who know my screen name and can contact me. It's hard to know who's really looking at your information and what they're doing with it.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but at the same time, I don't want to limit it too much because I use it to communicate with friends. It's a tricky balance to strike. I only accept people I know as friends, but I'm not really sure who else can see my information. My roommate was telling me about a time when her high school banned students from having Myspace, and I wasn't really sure how the school officials had the right to make that decision.",
            "I'm hesitant to bring up the Iraq War again, but I feel like it's worth discussing one more time. To be honest, I'm not sure I should be joining the chorus of people who claim they were against the war from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The majority of people everywhere, including the administration, have realized that the war was a bad idea. If we look at recent polls, it's clear that the overwhelming consensus is that the war was a mistake. In fact, polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population thinks the war was a bad idea. Even a significant portion of US troops stationed in Iraq, around 70%, believe that the war was a bad idea and that we should withdraw within a year. It's little wonder, considering the war has been a disaster from the start. The issue is that there's a huge cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern nations, making it difficult for the US to understand the local culture. The idea that we can impose democracy on a region where it may not be the preferred system is simplistic and misguided. While Saddam was undoubtedly a bad leader, we need to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to descend into chaos. The situation in Iraq has become like quicksand, and I'm not sure what to say about it. Honestly, I don't see a reason for us to stay in Iraq. I'm skeptical of the administration's claims that staying is beneficial and that problems will arise if we withdraw. I'm yet to hear a legitimate argument for why we should remain in Iraq beyond what's necessary to ensure a safe withdrawal. If the administration wants to pull out gradually, I'm not opposed to that. However, I don't see a compelling reason for us to stay any longer than necessary. What's striking is that, according to statistics, around 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, and a quarter of them want us to leave immediately. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and yet they're telling us to leave. It's hard to ignore their perspective, and it's possible that they know better than us. By asking them if we should leave and they say yes, we can avoid being blamed if things go wrong. If we do decide to help after that, at least we'll be seen as the good guys – well, as good as we can be in the Middle East.",
            "To be honest, I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. I mean, it's not just about women, though. I believe it's more about the specific field someone works in. For instance, even in industries where equality is supposed to be the norm, it can be tough for people to overcome the ingrained biases that have been built up over time. Think about it: most people still struggle to see past the \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from working under a woman. This is partly due to how society has been raised for so long, perpetuating the idea that men are the ones in charge.\n\nAs a result, women often feel like they have to work twice as hard to prove themselves. They might have all the qualifications for a promotion, but if they're not part of the traditional upper echelons of a company, they might not get the nod. It's the same issue in other industries, like fashion or caregiving. It's rare to see men taking on the role of primary caregiver, and when they do, society often frowns upon it. People assume that men should be the breadwinners, not the ones staying home with the kids.\n\nIn the fashion industry, it's even more complicated. If a man is interested in fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume he's not a \"real\" fashion expert. I mean, typically men who are into fashion have a certain style, and if someone who doesn't fit that mold tries to join the industry, people might wonder if they really know what they're talking about.\n\nIt's not just about men and women, though. People from different backgrounds can face discrimination too. For example, if someone grew up on a farm and didn't have the best education, but they're intelligent and work their way up to a high-level position, others might doubt their abilities because of their background. It's not just about gender, either - it's about where you're from and how you speak. So, I think that depending on the field and the individual, there's definitely still a lot of gender (and other forms of) discrimination in the US.\n\nChanging this is tough, though. Society has a set mindset, and it's hard to shift away from that. We've made progress, obviously - women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world - but it's a slow process. As people see more women in leadership positions and stay-at-home dads becoming more common, they're starting to accept it more. It's all about promoting the qualities of people who are often stereotyped against, without being pushy about it. If you force it, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, but change takes time, and we've come a long way already.",
            "Honestly, my understanding is that they didn't make it completely legal, but rather decriminalized it. Decriminalization essentially downgrades it from a serious crime to more of a traffic ticket - something you get cited for, rather than arrested and booked. This is a big deal for people, especially when it comes to job interviews and other future endeavors, because it's the worst part of having a drug charge. \n\nHowever, there's an argument that it's expensive to arrest and prosecute people, and then let them go. It costs a lot to bring them in, house them, and have them appear in court multiple times. Plus, there's the cost of public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office. For cash-strapped municipalities, it's hard to justify this expense, even if it would free up money for other important programs. \n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, seems to be okay with decriminalization. They might actually have more money to spend on things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless now. It's a big deal because marijuana isn't something you want to see everywhere, for a variety of reasons. There's a financial element to consider, as well as societal factors. \n\nIf marijuana were fully legalized, it could become like cigarettes - sold in gas stations and consumed everywhere. Some people might be worried about it being a major issue, especially with driving and smoking. It's still taboo in many places, and having it out in the open like that could be awkward for a lot of people. \n\nAlcohol has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. It's hard to generalize about substances, because everyone reacts differently. Some people can handle it, while others can't. It's complicated, and I think both substances have their own set of problems.",
            "I'd have to agree \nThe thing is, a lot of the methods they use have been around for ages \nThey stick to traditional practices, which is good in some ways \nBut it's also essential to be open to change \nMany people within the Catholic Church believe in attending church services every week \nHowever, the Church can be pretty strict about how things are done \nSometimes, it seems like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow their doctrine to the letter \nThey also don't always accept those who don't share their exact beliefs \nFor instance, my parents were both raised in different Christian denominations, and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them because of my dad's background \n\nIt seems like the Catholic Church teaches the importance of loving others, but then doesn't always put that into practice \nThis can come across as hypocritical when you consider their stance on other religions \nI think it's a matter of outdated doctrine that contradicts the actual practice \nThey continue to stick with the old ways, even if they're no longer relevant \n\nI don't think being allowed to marry would necessarily change the behavior of priests who engage in pedophilia \nAs I see it, the issue lies in the power dynamic between the priest and the child, not in their marital status \nIt's not like someone who would abuse a child would suddenly change their ways just because they're married \n\nThose who abuse children tend to do so regardless of their marital status \nIt's the relationship between the abuser and the victim that's the problem, not their marital situation \nSo, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these issues from occurring",
            "I'm still weighing my thoughts on this complex issue, and to be honest, I'm not entirely sure which side is right or wrong yet. The debate surrounding the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a real brain-twister. It's a delicate matter, and I can see why people might get tripped up trying to navigate it without offending anyone.\n\nFor me, the question of whether marriage should be defined by the government is a tough one. Marriage is often considered a sacred institution, and yet, people who get married don't necessarily receive special treatment from the government just because of their faith. If two people get baptized, for instance, they don't automatically receive tax breaks or other government benefits. It's a similar situation with marriage - it's essentially a civil union, a union between two consenting adults.\n\nI think the government should just focus on recognizing civil unions, rather than trying to define what kind of marriage they are. After all, it's about two individuals coming together in a commitment to each other, not about the specific details of their relationship. The fact that same-sex couples are seeking the same rights as everyone else is a no-brainer - they're just looking for a civil union, just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement on this, it should be made a federal law. However, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just not necessary. It's a cause that's not significant enough to warrant changing the constitution. The constitution should only be amended for truly fundamental reasons, not for something that affects a relatively small group of people.\n\nTo put it simply, banning gay marriage isn't worth amending the constitution. I'm afraid I'm not on board with that idea.",
            "to be honest, i was raised in a conservative christian household, and as such, homosexuality has always been somewhat of a complicated issue for me.  i have a lot of gay friends, which has definitely broadened my perspective, but at the same time, i still don't fully agree with that lifestyle choice.  however, i do think it should be legalized, but not because it's a federal issue.  i believe it should be left up to each individual state to decide for themselves.  after all, different states have different political leanings - some are more liberal, while others are more conservative.  if you're living in a state that leans democratic, it's likely that they'll push for gay marriage, and if you're not comfortable with that, perhaps you should consider moving to a state with different values.  still, i think that people of all orientations should have the same rights and opportunities, so i think it should be legalized state-by-state. \n\nas for the federal government, i don't think it's right for the president to impose their views on the entire country.  take bush, for example - just because he's in office, it doesn't mean he gets to dictate how every state should handle gay marriage.  that's a decision for the states to make, not the president.  and let's be real, he'll be out of office in a few years, so it's not like he'll have to live with the consequences of his decisions.  in the end, i think each state should be free to make their own decisions, without the president's interference.",
            "Honestly, I'd love to dive into this topic, but to be honest, I'm not quite sure where to start. Myspace, as a public platform, is essentially a bulletin board for people to share their thoughts and experiences with others. If you consider that definition, it's pretty clear that anything posted online is visible to the public, including school officials. Whether or not they're accessing it under the school's name, they could still find it through their personal computers at home.\n\nIn my opinion, if school officials use online platforms like Myspace to prevent potential threats, such as school shootings, then I think it's perfectly reasonable. After all, it's their responsibility to ensure student safety, and if that means monitoring online activity, then so be it. I mean, think about it - if they're checking the internet to see if students are engaging in activities they shouldn't be, they're doing it specifically to prevent trouble and catch potential issues.\n\nNow, I'm not saying I agree with the idea of invading students' privacy, but if it saves lives and makes the school a safer place, then I'm okay with it. It's not like they're snooping through personal emails or messages; they're just looking at public content. And let's be real, once something's online, it's there forever, so it's not like you can take it back.\n\nI think it's pretty ridiculous for students to expect to post whatever they want online without facing any consequences. I mean, we're all worried about saying something we might regret in an email or message, aren't we? And even if we think we're anonymous, there's always a chance that someone will see it and use it against us.\n\nIt's a bit like this: if you do something in college that gets you into trouble later on, there's no way to get out of it. Once it's online, it's there forever. And I'm not saying I think it's an invasion of privacy just because school officials are monitoring online activity. I mean, like I said before, it's a public thing.\n\nI'm not saying that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have a reason to do so, like to prevent a school shooting, then that's a different story. It's like what my teacher from public high school told me - they have to ensure the school is safe, and that means monitoring online activity.\n\nIt's kind of like during the terrorist attacks; we had to be safe, so we did lockdown drills and stuff. And while that doesn't directly relate to school shootings, it's kind of similar. They're just trying to prevent anything bad from happening, like what happened at Columbine. That's basically all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Honestly, I've been struggling to express my thoughts on the war, and it's been a long time coming. At first, I was all for it after 9/11, as I was personally affected, and I thought we should go in there and create chaos just like they did here. However, I think we overlooked the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nI believe we went in there unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately backfired. I was initially in favor of the war, but now I'm strongly against it. I don't think it's achieved anything. The people over there are so consumed by their own internal conflicts that they can't even fight us effectively. It's a waste of our time and resources to be there.\n\nTo be honest, I've become somewhat desensitized to what's happening over there due to 9/11. I just don't care about the situation anymore. At times, I find it hard to see the Iraqis as human beings because they're so focused on fighting each other. I think we went in there with a simplistic idea of how to solve their problems, but it's not that easy.\n\nWar is a completely different beast in Iraq than it is for us. They have a much more brutal approach to conflict, and I don't think they're interested in improving their country; they just want us out. I think we should just leave and be done with it.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were more driven by revenge and a desire to \"do something\" after 9/11, rather than thinking through the potential consequences. President Bush seemed to take it upon himself to declare war on Iraq, and I understand where he was coming from, but I don't think we had a choice. However, I do think we could have planned better and had a clearer idea of what we were trying to achieve.\n\nLack of unity and a clear plan have hindered our efforts. We didn't have a clear understanding of what we wanted to accomplish, and we didn't prepare for the aftermath. I think that's what ultimately led to the mess we're in.\n\nHonestly, I don't think we're the ones who can change the Iraqi people. They've always been that way, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I think we're just prolonging the inevitable by staying there. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify the cost. I believe we're ultimately hurting ourselves by staying in Iraq, and once we leave, the situation will likely collapse."
