            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "i think the catholic church really needs to reevaluate its stance on certain issues. they're experiencing a decline in followers, and i believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. for instance, their rigid views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite outdated and may be driving people away. if they adapted to a more modern perspective, they might not lose their followers. many people are turning against the church due to its traditional views on these matters. those who disagree with the church on these subjects may not feel comfortable being part of a community where such views are strongly emphasized. this could lead to people leaving the church because they feel they're going against its teachings. i don't see why the church can't reconsider its stance on issues like female priests or priests being able to get married. it's possible that if they allowed priests to have personal relationships, it might not have changed the outcome, but it's worth exploring. however, the church's stance on these topics seems archaic, and it's hard to understand why they can't find a middle ground. they claim that priests are married to god and devoted to their faith, but they're essentially denying them a normal life with a family and loved ones, just like everyone else.",
            "Honestly, I'll be the first to admit that I haven't fully given much thought to the issue of gay marriage. However, I'm not opposed to the idea in principle. I think people, regardless of their sexual orientation, shouldn't be held accountable for who they are. It's not like being gay is a choice that someone makes consciously. I believe people are born with their orientation, and it's not something they should be penalized for. To deny gay couples the right to marriage while allowing opposite-sex couples to do so just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nOn a deeper level, the idea that people's sexual orientation is not a choice seems obvious. Think about it - I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not as if they have control over it. This lack of control means they shouldn't be held responsible for who they are.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government shouldn't be involved in issues like this. It's not a matter of law or morality; it's simply about giving people the freedom to be who they are. I don't think it's fair to put people on a pedestal and imply they made a wrong decision or choice. Gay people aren't doing anything wrong; they're just existing and being themselves.\n\nFrankly, I think the federal government is out of place here. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's simply a matter of people's personal lives. They shouldn't be intervened in or judged based on their orientation. It's who they are, and that's not something they should be punished for.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "I'm in favor of legalizing gay marriage because there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but that's not true. It's like saying heads will never be tails - they're two sides of the same coin. While people may have different views on the matter, there are many civil rights at stake, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a gay couple is together, their partner shouldn't be denied the right to be with them in the hospital or visit them when they're sick.\n\nThe fact is, scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship, such as communication, trust, and commitment. It's not about getting married in a church; it's about obtaining a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, it's hard to argue against granting marriage to gay couples. It's essentially segregation, separate but unequal. People worry about adoption issues and community concerns, but these concerns are unfounded. Gay couples can be just as good parents as heterosexual couples, and their children will face the same challenges in school and society.\n\nIn fact, some cities, like New York, have already implemented programs to support children of gay parents, such as special schools to protect them from bullying and harassment. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about the quality of care and parenting skills.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is hypocritical, considering the government's stance on other issues, such as stem cell research and the Pledge of Allegiance. It's unacceptable to enforce religious standards on an entire country while ignoring the moral and cultural diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to institutions that conduct research and studies, rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Well, I've got a bit of a soapbox moment here, so bear with me. As a pharmacy intern in a hospital over the summer, I've had some time to think about the whole issue of illegal substances. Now, just because something's on the list of forbidden substances doesn't mean it's inherently bad. Take it for what it's worth, I think it's fair to say that some illegal drugs have real benefits.\n\nIn fact, pharmacies like the one I'm working at use controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets all the time because they're proven to help people. And let's be real, if we're going to dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana because of its illegality, that's just a cop-out. We should be able to explore its medicinal uses without fear of judgment.\n\nI'm not saying it's identical to alcohol, which can be abused and lead to all sorts of problems. But if we're honest, marijuana isn't exactly the same. If we could create a more nuanced view of marijuana, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, maybe people would use it more responsibly. After all, it's not like it's heroin or cocaine – it's not that toxic.\n\nMy point is, getting rid of the negative stigma surrounding marijuana might be the first step towards using it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes. If we could move past the 'terrifying illicit substance' image, people might be more likely to use it in a way that's not detrimental to their health.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has made some adjustments to fit into the 21st century. It's not as traditional as it used to be. Growing up, I used to go to church every Sunday, and it was a big deal - I'd get dressed up in matching outfits, including a cute little dress, shoes, and a purse. It was a big part of my private school experience, where I'd see all my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, I've noticed some changes. They've introduced a shorter, 30-minute mass for teenagers, and it's become more casual. People often dress down, especially in the summer, and even families who run late still show up. It's become a more relaxed atmosphere, even during morning masses where people used to dress up. I've noticed that people now wear jeans and khakis, which is still nice, but it's a more casual vibe overall.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the shift in the church's atmosphere. I'm not familiar with the church's politics, but that's my observation. As for the recent scandals involving Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not about the marriage or lack thereof - it's about the individual's attraction to young kids. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their personal decision, and there are other faiths that allow their leaders to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, perhaps they should consider a different denomination.\n\nI was asked to elaborate on my answer, and I think it boils down to the idea that pedophilia is more about genetics than environmental factors. People are born with their inclinations, and you can't change that through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and covered them up, that's a problem, but I don't think they were aware of everything in all cases. As for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments.",
            "Honestly, at first, I wasn't entirely opposed to the premise, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the September 11th attacks was still a sensitive time, and we kind of got sidetracked into Iraq for reasons that weren't entirely genuine. The Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since been revealed that these claims were false.\n\nTo be frank, this really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems to me that the Bush administration has lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it, even with Colin Powell admitting he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a serious abuse of power and, in my opinion, an impeachable offense.\n\nIt's also disturbing to see the administration disregard the constitution and try to undermine it since 9/11. I think they came into office with the intention of going to war, despite the supposed pretext of WMDs and a connection to 9/11. In fact, it's been suggested that younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and that he wanted to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded motive.\n\nI think the war has dragged on for too long, but withdrawing now would have its own set of problems, as there's a risk that the country would descend into civil war and more people would lose their lives. The alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It's likely to create more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty becomes an increasingly contentious issue. The interim government is already showing signs of disintegration, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control. The presence of radical elements, like Mugtada al-Sadr's party with 20 seats in Parliament, is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I'm struggling to articulate my concerns in a polite manner.",
            "i was supposed to write something about my thoughts on the war in iraq, but it's really hard to form a coherent opinion on the topic. to be honest, i'm not even sure what's going on over there anymore. from what i understand, it started as a kind of get-back reaction because we thought iraq was behind the nine eleven attacks. but now it seems like we're just trying to set up a democracy in iraq, which sounds like a nice idea, but it's a lot harder to achieve than it sounds. \n\ni'm not really an expert on the war, but it seems like we're just causing more problems by being there. i mean, we're using a lot of resources, and it's making everyone upset. if we stay, we'll have to try and create a democracy, which will take a long time, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up. it's a tough spot to be in.\n\ni've been trying to think about this for a while, but it's just really hard to wrap my head around it. i don't even know if i should be calling it a war anymore, since it wasn't even declared by congress. i think that's how it's supposed to work, right? \n\ni guess my opinion is that it's a pointless thing to stay in iraq, but at the same time, i feel bad for all the families whose kids are over there fighting. it's like, i want them to be safe, but at the same time, we're kind of destroying their country and culture. it's hard to say what's the right thing to do. \n\ni feel like the war is going to go on for a long time, and it's just going to get worse and worse. it's already making us look bad, and it's just causing more and more problems. it's hard to know what to think, but i guess that's my two cents on the matter.\n\ni think the whole thing would be a lot simpler if we just declared it a war and got it over with, but that's not how it works. it's like, we're trying to turn iraq into a second u.s., but that's not going to work. it's just going to make things worse, and it's going to fuel the al-qaeda thing even more. i don't know, it's just a mess.\n\nanyway, that's my attempt at forming an opinion on the war in iraq. i'm not exactly sure what to think, but i hope that's a start.",
            "To be honest, I have strong reservations about the government declaring something as legal or not. I believe it's more the domain of churches to decide these matters, given the separation of church and state as outlined in the constitution. This principle is crystal clear, and any attempt to impose power over it would essentially defy the constitution's written words. \n\nIn my opinion, those trying to make it illegal are essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. The fact that most Catholics and Christians don't support it, except in a few areas, speaks volumes. It doesn't seem right for the government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Proposing an amendment to address this issue seems counterintuitive, as it would contradict the constitution's existing provisions. Furthermore, it would likely be the only amendment restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs, which raises the concern that he's favoring one religion over others. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not the government or its officials. There's little justification for the amendment beyond personal views, and I fail to see how it would positively impact the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive effect on society, so I don't think there's a valid reason to pursue it.\n\nI've expressed my main points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "Okay, I was thinking about the war in Iraq, and I believe the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for invading the country before going in. It seemed like there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which wasn't entirely accurate. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the invasion, and it began in 2003.\n\nTo start, I'm not a fan of war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq has a lot of parallels with the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes and not repeated them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is tragic and unacceptable.\n\nWhen the US invaded Iraq, they removed the country's government without being prepared for the aftermath or the power vacuum that would follow. It's like trying to impose a democratic government without considering the potential consequences. They were trying to do the same thing in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and establishing democracy.\n\nHowever, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process. It's not something that can be achieved easily, especially when you're fighting an insurgency rather than a conventional army. You're fighting ordinary citizens who are resisting the occupation, making it extremely difficult to put them down.\n\nI think the government rushed into war without being adequately prepared for the outcome, and that's been a major issue. If we're going to go to war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government failed to do this, and we're still dealing with the consequences. Many American troops are still in Iraq, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to take control of their country.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government tried to deceive the American people by making it seem like the invasion would be a quick and successful operation. However, it's not that simple. Implementing a new form of government takes time, and it's not something that can be achieved overnight. We're naive to think it would be easy, especially when we consider our own country's history with democracy.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated issue, and there's no easy solution. If I had to vote in the 2004 presidential election, one of my reservations about voting for George Bush was that he would finish what he started. However, it's hard to abandon a country after being involved for so long, especially when we've taken away their government and way of life.\n\nOn the other hand, it's impossible to ignore the number of American casualties and the risk of further losses. We need to consider the cost of continuing the war and whether it's worth it for the sake of a free democratic Iraq. If we're making the case that Iraq needs democracy, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the real reason is the oil issue and controlling resources. The US government's decisions are often driven by self-interest and a desire for power.\n\nIn conclusion, I just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that peace is restored. However, I'm not optimistic about the situation, and it's likely that it will take a long time to resolve.",
            "Well, let me get this straight - I'm all for gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal choice, and I think it's ridiculous that people are still debating this. With all the evidence that shows it's not just a social construct, but something that could be biological, it's inhumane to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI'm not sure why the government and politicians are even involved in this. It's a personal issue, not a state or national concern. I mean, take my neighborhood for instance - there are at least two openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and what's the difference? I think it's absurd that President Bush is trying to dictate what marriage means and imposing his own interpretation on the rest of us.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's a growing body of evidence that suggests there's a chemical component to being gay, something that's not just a product of upbringing or environment. It's not like being gay is a choice, it's a natural part of who people are. So, I just don't get why it's such a big deal.\n\nIt's not like straight couples need to jump through hoops to get married. If a guy and a girl want to get hitched, they can just elope in Vegas and nobody bats an eye, but if two gay people want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's splashed all over the national news.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Well, I'm here to give you a reality check - when you post something online, it's essentially public domain. You can't expect your personal opinions or actions to remain private. As someone who's dealt with this firsthand as a resident advisor, I can attest to the fact that anything you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. This can be particularly problematic when you're discussing sensitive or serious topics like violence or shootings. Someone, somewhere, will inevitably stumble upon it and react.\n\nThe internet is a vast, open space that's accessible to everyone, including your friends and acquaintances on social media platforms. Whether it's a bulletin on Myspace or a post on Facebook, it's not just a school or institution that's exposed to it - it's the entire online community. If something serious enough is posted, it can put people on high alert, and as you can imagine, schools and institutions can't just ignore these warnings.\n\nIt's a delicate line to walk because, on the one hand, some people might be joking or engaging in a social experiment, while others might be genuinely expressing their thoughts or concerns. Take the recent incident at our school, for example, where someone overheard a comment and reported it, leading to a deeper investigation. It turned out that a student had posted some concerning content on their social media profiles that they never intended to be taken seriously, but in hindsight, it became a serious issue.\n\nWhen you post something online, you should be aware that there's no such thing as true online privacy. If you don't want your thoughts or actions to be public knowledge, it's best not to post them in the first place. You can't control how people interpret your online presence, but you can control what you put out there. School officials, for instance, shouldn't be friending their students on social media or snooping through their profiles - that's just not their place.\n\nHowever, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a different story if they're monitoring private communications like phone conversations or texts without consent. But if it's something that's publicly available, they can't just ignore it.\n\nAs a residential advisor, I wouldn't even think of friending my residents on social media, not because I'm concerned about their online activities, but because I don't want to be privy to that information. That's not my place, and I'd rather not have to deal with the potential consequences. So, to sum it up, be mindful of what you post online because it can have real-world implications.",
            "I'm starting to feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the idea seemed to be a good one – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original goal. Instead, it feels like we're fighting for the sake of being a global superpower, just to prove a point. I'm also concerned that the real motives behind the war were questionable from the start, considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, as long as there weren't any personal agendas involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective in the first few months, and that was a significant statement in itself.\n\nThe fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, or even several years, is just too much. I believe our purpose has been slowly eroded over time, and it's now more about being at war for the sake of being at war. We're not looking for a decisive end or a victory; we just don't want to lose face.\n\nI think it's time for us to call it quits. The Iraqi government will eventually have to take care of itself, and our continued involvement is just draining our economy. We're spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose, while we have our own problems to address, such as poverty and internal issues like public roads, schools, and healthcare. It seems like a waste of resources to be spending that money on a war that's not achieving its original goal.\n\nIt's astounding to think that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not in our long-term budget. We have our own problems to solve at home, and it's time for us to focus on those. Our citizens are dying in a foreign country, and it's just not worth it.",
            "I wanted to clarify a point, but I'm not sure if I should even bring it up. Apparently, someone online discovered that there was a reason certain information was being kept from the public. Okay, so here's my question: if you post stuff on the internet, like on Myspace, for instance, you have to accept that a lot of people are going to see it. I mean, if you want to be friends with someone on Myspace, you basically give them permission to view your profile, right? So, anytime you put info on the internet, you have to understand that it's out there for anyone to see.\n\nIt's a bit of a tough situation because, on one hand, you can't have someone sitting around all day monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening, but on the other hand, it's like, what if they're just looking for evidence of someone doing something wrong? It's not clear-cut. I mean, I don't think it's right to have someone's job just to snoop through people's profiles, but I guess it depends on the circumstances.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's a bit unsettling to think that there are people out there who can see things about me just by looking at my profile. I saw this thing on TV once where this guy was showing how easy it is to get information about someone online. He went onto this girl's Myspace profile and got her screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. It's pretty scary.\n\nIt's hard to balance the fact that you want to be able to communicate with your friends online, but at the same time, you don't want to put too much information out there that could be used against you. I've noticed that some of my classmates can IM me without even knowing my screen name, which is a bit unnerving. They know a lot about me from my profile, including my class schedule and what my friends are like. I've tried to limit what I put up, but it's a tricky balance to strike.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she said that in her high school, students were banned from having Myspace accounts. I'm not sure how the school had the right to do that, and it seemed a bit unfair. I'm not sure if that's a real privacy issue, but it did strike me as strange.",
            "I struggled with whether to bring up the Iraq War topic, but I guess I have to eventually. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's not really a crucial issue anymore, as everyone except the Bush administration seems to agree that it was a bad idea. Looking at the recent polls, it's clear that the majority of the world population thinks so, with around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops in Iraq all sharing this sentiment. It's hard to argue with the fact that the conflict has been a disaster since before our involvement, and now it's a challenge to find a solution that won't make things worse.\n\nI believe the underlying issue is the deep cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern states, which makes it difficult for our administration to understand the local perspective. It's naive to think we can impose democracy on an area where it's not naturally embraced. While Saddam was a bad guy, we should have carefully weighed the pros and cons before invading. The situation has turned into a quagmire, and I don't see a reason for us to stay any longer. I'm not convinced by the administration's arguments about the potential problems that might arise from our withdrawal, and I'd love to hear a legitimate reason to stay.\n\nIf the administration plans to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I just can't see the justification for prolonging our presence. It's even more ironic that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're essentially telling us to leave. I think they might know better than us, and at least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the enemy in the Middle East.",
            "you know, i think gender discrimination is still an issue in the US.  it's not just a women's problem, though - it's more complex than that.  i believe it's often tied to the specific industry or work environment, and how long it's traditionally been male-dominated.  for instance, in business, women face a 'glass ceiling' where they might have all the qualifications for a job, but are overlooked for promotions due to ingrained societal attitudes. \n\nthe same can be said for men in certain industries, like fashion, where being a stay-at-home parent is often viewed as unusual and not masculine.  it's a common stereotype that men should be the breadwinners, and people look down on them if they choose to take on more domestic responsibilities.  this can be tough for men who want to be involved in childcare and support their families, but are judged for their choices. \n\nin fashion, there's also the issue of men being taken seriously if they're interested in it as a career.  people often doubt their credibility because of societal expectations around masculinity and style.  it's like, how can you truly understand fashion if you're a guy?  the same goes for men who don't fit the typical mold of masculinity.\n\nsocietal attitudes and mindsets are hard to change, and it's a slow process.  we've made progress, but it's still a work in progress.  women are breaking into leadership positions and being accepted in the business world, and more men are choosing to be stay-at-home dads.  as we continue to push for change, it's essential to promote the qualities and strengths of those who are often stereotyped or overlooked.  we need to do this in a way that's not pushy or aggressive, but rather by showcasing their abilities and potential. \n\nit's all about finding a balance and promoting acceptance, rather than forcing it.  we're at a good point where it's starting to become more mainstream, but change takes time.  i'm not sure what more we can do, as it seems like we're already seeing progress.  it's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and with varying levels of education can face discrimination, not just based on gender but also on other factors like socioeconomic status, education level, or geographical location.",
            "It seems that many people misunderstand the recent changes to the law regarding this substance.  To clarify, it was decriminalized, not fully legalized. In other words, it's no longer a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, akin to a traffic ticket. You might get cited and fined without facing the full penalties of arrest and prosecution.\n\nOne issue people often worry about when it comes to decriminalization is the potential long-term consequences, such as difficulties in job interviews and other professional situations. These repercussions can still linger even after decriminalization. However, some argue that the costs associated with arresting and processing individuals, including courtroom appearances and public defender fees, can be substantial.\n\nFrom a budgetary perspective, many municipalities struggle to justify the expense of enforcing this law. Even if it would lead to significant cost savings, some communities may not be willing to make this change, especially if they're strongly opposed to the substance.\n\nOn the other hand, places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, might find it reasonable to decriminalize it. As a result, they could potentially redirect funds to more pressing needs, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and services for the homeless.\n\nIt's essential to consider the financial implications, as well as other factors, when discussing this topic. While marijuana shouldn't be allowed to be ubiquitous, the financial element does play a role in the decision-making process. Some people might be concerned that if it were fully legalized, it could lead to widespread use and potentially problematic behaviors, like driving under the influence. However, it's also true that many people view marijuana as taboo, and making it widely available might be awkward for some.\n\nIn general, both marijuana and alcohol have their negative effects, but they can impact people differently. Some might be more susceptible to the lifestyle consequences of marijuana use, while others may be more affected by its impact on motor skills. Ultimately, everyone's reaction to substances is unique, and it's difficult to make broad generalizations.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree [REWRITE]However, [REWRITE]There are many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church that have remained consistent over time, and [REWRITE]it's great to see these enduring practices [REWRITE]But at the same time, it's essential to be open to change [REWRITE]Many Catholics adhere to the idea of attending church every week, and [REWRITE]they're quite particular about how things are done [REWRITE]Sometimes, though, I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine [REWRITE]Furthermore, they don't accept individuals who aren't flawless Catholics or those from other faiths [REWRITE]For example, my parents' interfaith marriage was not recognized in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background [REWRITE]This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, given the Catholic emphasis on loving others [REWRITE]It's like they're preaching one thing but not practicing it [REWRITE]The disconnect between doctrine and practice is a significant issue, especially when it's rooted in outdated ideas [REWRITE]Despite this, they continue to stick with these outdated practices [REWRITE]Personally, I think it would be beneficial to allow priests to marry [REWRITE]However, I'm not convinced that this would prevent pedophilic behavior [REWRITE]Those who engage in such acts likely wouldn't be deterred by marriage [REWRITE]It's a different dynamic altogether, and [REWRITE]I don't think allowing priests to be married would necessarily make a difference [REWRITE]In other words, child abuse is a separate issue that wouldn't be resolved by allowing priests to marry [REWRITE]It's a complex problem that requires a more comprehensive approach [REWRITE]",
            "so i haven't made up my mind on this yet, but it's a pretty tricky topic. the lines between separation of church and state are getting blurred, and defining marriage has become a really touchy issue. on one hand, you have civil unions, which i think are a good alternative, but on the other hand, you have this whole idea of marriage as a sacrament that's deeply rooted in faith. if that's the case, people don't get tax breaks or any special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. so i'm inclined to think that marriage should be viewed as a civil union, a union between two people, without any government interference in what that union is or isn't.\n\nthe thing is, the fact that gay marriage is even a debate is a bit of a non-starter. if two people want to get married, or enter into a civil union, it's really no one's business but theirs. and if the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should make it federal law. but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? that just seems like overkill. it's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution.\n\nit's not like it's some huge, earth-shattering cause that's worth amending the constitution over. it's just not that important. and to be honest, it's pretty ridiculous to try to define marriage in the constitution in the first place. i'm not even sure what to say to that.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to a somewhat mixed perspective on homosexuality for me. On one hand, I have many close gay friends, so it's hard for me to take a one-dimensional stance on the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't believe it's a matter for the federal government to decide; rather, each state should have the autonomy to make its own decision.\n\nConsidering the diversity of our country, with some states being more liberal and others more conservative, it's likely that each state will have its own stance on gay marriage. If you live in a state that has already legalized it, I don't think you should disagree with the decision, as you have chosen to reside there and should respect the local laws. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, and therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left up to individual states.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but to reiterate, I don't think the president should be able to impose their will on the entire country in regards to this issue. President Bush's ban on gay marriage doesn't sit well with me, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't dictate how each one runs itself. It would be more productive to let the states decide for themselves. Plus, with the president's term coming to an end soon, the issue will likely be revisited, and it's better to let each state make its own decision rather than having it change every time the presidency switches hands. It's the states that will have to live with the consequences of this decision, not the president.",
            "Honestly, I'm finding it difficult to articulate my thoughts on this issue. Let me break it down for you. MySpace, like the internet in general, is a public platform where you post content for others to see. If you put something online, you have to accept that people will view it, including school officials. Even if you post under a pseudonym, they could still access it from their homes. In a situation where it might prevent a school shooting, I believe they have every right to do so. Their primary responsibility is to ensure student safety.\n\nIn fact, if school officials monitor Myspace to identify students engaging in prohibited activities, I think that's perfectly fine. It's their job to maintain a safe environment, and if that means keeping an eye on students' online behavior, so be it. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and invading students' privacy. However, if the monitoring leads to a safer school environment, I don't consider it an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but I'll try to summarize. Posting on Myspace is like sharing information with the public. If you're worried about getting in trouble for something you post, it's not unreasonable. Once something is online, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. This is something I'm cautious about, even in emails.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, and if that means monitoring Myspace or other online platforms, I'm okay with it. In fact, I've discussed this with a teacher of mine, and they feel the same way. They have to be prepared for potential threats, like lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. In a way, this incident was similar, as they were trying to prevent something like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn short, I think school officials were justified in monitoring Myspace to ensure student safety. They were simply doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. That's all I wanted to say on the matter.",
            "I guess I've been a bit quiet lately because I'm still trying to process my thoughts on the war. To be honest, my initial reaction after 9/11 was to support it. I was personally affected, and I felt like we needed to take action and show them that their actions wouldn't be tolerated. I think we went in there with a lot of emotions and anger, which clouded our judgment. We didn't really think about the long-term consequences or have a clear plan, which ultimately led to things not going as smoothly as we had hoped.\n\nI've since changed my mind and I'm now firmly against the war. I don't think it's done anything to help the situation, and in fact, I think it's made things worse. The people over there are fighting amongst themselves, so us being there isn't really accomplishing anything. It's like they're more focused on fighting each other than working towards a common goal, and I just don't see how us being there is making a difference.\n\nTo be blunt, I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel like we're just throwing our money and lives away for no reason. I've come to realize that war is a completely different beast when you're not the one waging it. The people over there have a completely different mindset, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, but rather get rid of us.\n\nLooking back, I think we went in there on a mission of revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. I think President Bush was swept up in the emotional response to 9/11 and declared war on Iraq without a clear plan in place. At the time, I understood where he was coming from, but now I think we should have taken a more measured approach.\n\nI don't think we could have just let things go after 9/11, but I do think we could have done a better job of planning and executing our strategy. There was a lack of unity and clear direction, and that's something that would have made a big difference. As it stands, I think we're just making things worse and hurting ourselves more than anyone else.\n\nWe're not the ones to change the people over there; they're going to be who they are, and we're not going to be able to fix that. I think we're just delaying the inevitable by staying there, and it's time for us to leave. We're not making enough progress, and once we do leave, things will likely collapse. I think we're just wasting our time and resources by staying, and it's time to cut our losses."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "i think the catholic church really needs to reevaluate its stance on certain issues. they're experiencing a decline in followers, and i believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. for instance, their rigid views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite outdated and may be driving people away. if they adapted to a more modern perspective, they might not lose their followers. many people are turning against the church due to its traditional views on these matters. those who disagree with the church on these subjects may not feel comfortable being part of a community where such views are strongly emphasized. this could lead to people leaving the church because they feel they're going against its teachings. i don't see why the church can't reconsider its stance on issues like female priests or priests being able to get married. it's possible that if they allowed priests to have personal relationships, it might not have changed the outcome, but it's worth exploring. however, the church's stance on these topics seems archaic, and it's hard to understand why they can't find a middle ground. they claim that priests are married to god and devoted to their faith, but they're essentially denying them a normal life with a family and loved ones, just like everyone else.",
            "Honestly, I'll be the first to admit that I haven't fully given much thought to the issue of gay marriage. However, I'm not opposed to the idea in principle. I think people, regardless of their sexual orientation, shouldn't be held accountable for who they are. It's not like being gay is a choice that someone makes consciously. I believe people are born with their orientation, and it's not something they should be penalized for. To deny gay couples the right to marriage while allowing opposite-sex couples to do so just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nOn a deeper level, the idea that people's sexual orientation is not a choice seems obvious. Think about it - I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not as if they have control over it. This lack of control means they shouldn't be held responsible for who they are.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government shouldn't be involved in issues like this. It's not a matter of law or morality; it's simply about giving people the freedom to be who they are. I don't think it's fair to put people on a pedestal and imply they made a wrong decision or choice. Gay people aren't doing anything wrong; they're just existing and being themselves.\n\nFrankly, I think the federal government is out of place here. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's simply a matter of people's personal lives. They shouldn't be intervened in or judged based on their orientation. It's who they are, and that's not something they should be punished for.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "I'm in favor of legalizing gay marriage because there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but that's not true. It's like saying heads will never be tails - they're two sides of the same coin. While people may have different views on the matter, there are many civil rights at stake, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a gay couple is together, their partner shouldn't be denied the right to be with them in the hospital or visit them when they're sick.\n\nThe fact is, scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship, such as communication, trust, and commitment. It's not about getting married in a church; it's about obtaining a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, it's hard to argue against granting marriage to gay couples. It's essentially segregation, separate but unequal. People worry about adoption issues and community concerns, but these concerns are unfounded. Gay couples can be just as good parents as heterosexual couples, and their children will face the same challenges in school and society.\n\nIn fact, some cities, like New York, have already implemented programs to support children of gay parents, such as special schools to protect them from bullying and harassment. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about the quality of care and parenting skills.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is hypocritical, considering the government's stance on other issues, such as stem cell research and the Pledge of Allegiance. It's unacceptable to enforce religious standards on an entire country while ignoring the moral and cultural diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to institutions that conduct research and studies, rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Well, I've got a bit of a soapbox moment here, so bear with me. As a pharmacy intern in a hospital over the summer, I've had some time to think about the whole issue of illegal substances. Now, just because something's on the list of forbidden substances doesn't mean it's inherently bad. Take it for what it's worth, I think it's fair to say that some illegal drugs have real benefits.\n\nIn fact, pharmacies like the one I'm working at use controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets all the time because they're proven to help people. And let's be real, if we're going to dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana because of its illegality, that's just a cop-out. We should be able to explore its medicinal uses without fear of judgment.\n\nI'm not saying it's identical to alcohol, which can be abused and lead to all sorts of problems. But if we're honest, marijuana isn't exactly the same. If we could create a more nuanced view of marijuana, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, maybe people would use it more responsibly. After all, it's not like it's heroin or cocaine – it's not that toxic.\n\nMy point is, getting rid of the negative stigma surrounding marijuana might be the first step towards using it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes. If we could move past the 'terrifying illicit substance' image, people might be more likely to use it in a way that's not detrimental to their health.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has made some adjustments to fit into the 21st century. It's not as traditional as it used to be. Growing up, I used to go to church every Sunday, and it was a big deal - I'd get dressed up in matching outfits, including a cute little dress, shoes, and a purse. It was a big part of my private school experience, where I'd see all my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, I've noticed some changes. They've introduced a shorter, 30-minute mass for teenagers, and it's become more casual. People often dress down, especially in the summer, and even families who run late still show up. It's become a more relaxed atmosphere, even during morning masses where people used to dress up. I've noticed that people now wear jeans and khakis, which is still nice, but it's a more casual vibe overall.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the shift in the church's atmosphere. I'm not familiar with the church's politics, but that's my observation. As for the recent scandals involving Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not about the marriage or lack thereof - it's about the individual's attraction to young kids. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their personal decision, and there are other faiths that allow their leaders to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, perhaps they should consider a different denomination.\n\nI was asked to elaborate on my answer, and I think it boils down to the idea that pedophilia is more about genetics than environmental factors. People are born with their inclinations, and you can't change that through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and covered them up, that's a problem, but I don't think they were aware of everything in all cases. As for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments.",
            "Honestly, at first, I wasn't entirely opposed to the premise, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the September 11th attacks was still a sensitive time, and we kind of got sidetracked into Iraq for reasons that weren't entirely genuine. The Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since been revealed that these claims were false.\n\nTo be frank, this really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems to me that the Bush administration has lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it, even with Colin Powell admitting he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a serious abuse of power and, in my opinion, an impeachable offense.\n\nIt's also disturbing to see the administration disregard the constitution and try to undermine it since 9/11. I think they came into office with the intention of going to war, despite the supposed pretext of WMDs and a connection to 9/11. In fact, it's been suggested that younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and that he wanted to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded motive.\n\nI think the war has dragged on for too long, but withdrawing now would have its own set of problems, as there's a risk that the country would descend into civil war and more people would lose their lives. The alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It's likely to create more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty becomes an increasingly contentious issue. The interim government is already showing signs of disintegration, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control. The presence of radical elements, like Mugtada al-Sadr's party with 20 seats in Parliament, is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I'm struggling to articulate my concerns in a polite manner.",
            "i was supposed to write something about my thoughts on the war in iraq, but it's really hard to form a coherent opinion on the topic. to be honest, i'm not even sure what's going on over there anymore. from what i understand, it started as a kind of get-back reaction because we thought iraq was behind the nine eleven attacks. but now it seems like we're just trying to set up a democracy in iraq, which sounds like a nice idea, but it's a lot harder to achieve than it sounds. \n\ni'm not really an expert on the war, but it seems like we're just causing more problems by being there. i mean, we're using a lot of resources, and it's making everyone upset. if we stay, we'll have to try and create a democracy, which will take a long time, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up. it's a tough spot to be in.\n\ni've been trying to think about this for a while, but it's just really hard to wrap my head around it. i don't even know if i should be calling it a war anymore, since it wasn't even declared by congress. i think that's how it's supposed to work, right? \n\ni guess my opinion is that it's a pointless thing to stay in iraq, but at the same time, i feel bad for all the families whose kids are over there fighting. it's like, i want them to be safe, but at the same time, we're kind of destroying their country and culture. it's hard to say what's the right thing to do. \n\ni feel like the war is going to go on for a long time, and it's just going to get worse and worse. it's already making us look bad, and it's just causing more and more problems. it's hard to know what to think, but i guess that's my two cents on the matter.\n\ni think the whole thing would be a lot simpler if we just declared it a war and got it over with, but that's not how it works. it's like, we're trying to turn iraq into a second u.s., but that's not going to work. it's just going to make things worse, and it's going to fuel the al-qaeda thing even more. i don't know, it's just a mess.\n\nanyway, that's my attempt at forming an opinion on the war in iraq. i'm not exactly sure what to think, but i hope that's a start.",
            "To be honest, I have strong reservations about the government declaring something as legal or not. I believe it's more the domain of churches to decide these matters, given the separation of church and state as outlined in the constitution. This principle is crystal clear, and any attempt to impose power over it would essentially defy the constitution's written words. \n\nIn my opinion, those trying to make it illegal are essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. The fact that most Catholics and Christians don't support it, except in a few areas, speaks volumes. It doesn't seem right for the government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Proposing an amendment to address this issue seems counterintuitive, as it would contradict the constitution's existing provisions. Furthermore, it would likely be the only amendment restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs, which raises the concern that he's favoring one religion over others. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not the government or its officials. There's little justification for the amendment beyond personal views, and I fail to see how it would positively impact the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive effect on society, so I don't think there's a valid reason to pursue it.\n\nI've expressed my main points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "Okay, I was thinking about the war in Iraq, and I believe the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for invading the country before going in. It seemed like there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which wasn't entirely accurate. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the invasion, and it began in 2003.\n\nTo start, I'm not a fan of war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq has a lot of parallels with the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes and not repeated them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is tragic and unacceptable.\n\nWhen the US invaded Iraq, they removed the country's government without being prepared for the aftermath or the power vacuum that would follow. It's like trying to impose a democratic government without considering the potential consequences. They were trying to do the same thing in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and establishing democracy.\n\nHowever, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process. It's not something that can be achieved easily, especially when you're fighting an insurgency rather than a conventional army. You're fighting ordinary citizens who are resisting the occupation, making it extremely difficult to put them down.\n\nI think the government rushed into war without being adequately prepared for the outcome, and that's been a major issue. If we're going to go to war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government failed to do this, and we're still dealing with the consequences. Many American troops are still in Iraq, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to take control of their country.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government tried to deceive the American people by making it seem like the invasion would be a quick and successful operation. However, it's not that simple. Implementing a new form of government takes time, and it's not something that can be achieved overnight. We're naive to think it would be easy, especially when we consider our own country's history with democracy.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated issue, and there's no easy solution. If I had to vote in the 2004 presidential election, one of my reservations about voting for George Bush was that he would finish what he started. However, it's hard to abandon a country after being involved for so long, especially when we've taken away their government and way of life.\n\nOn the other hand, it's impossible to ignore the number of American casualties and the risk of further losses. We need to consider the cost of continuing the war and whether it's worth it for the sake of a free democratic Iraq. If we're making the case that Iraq needs democracy, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the real reason is the oil issue and controlling resources. The US government's decisions are often driven by self-interest and a desire for power.\n\nIn conclusion, I just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that peace is restored. However, I'm not optimistic about the situation, and it's likely that it will take a long time to resolve.",
            "Well, let me get this straight - I'm all for gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal choice, and I think it's ridiculous that people are still debating this. With all the evidence that shows it's not just a social construct, but something that could be biological, it's inhumane to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI'm not sure why the government and politicians are even involved in this. It's a personal issue, not a state or national concern. I mean, take my neighborhood for instance - there are at least two openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and what's the difference? I think it's absurd that President Bush is trying to dictate what marriage means and imposing his own interpretation on the rest of us.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's a growing body of evidence that suggests there's a chemical component to being gay, something that's not just a product of upbringing or environment. It's not like being gay is a choice, it's a natural part of who people are. So, I just don't get why it's such a big deal.\n\nIt's not like straight couples need to jump through hoops to get married. If a guy and a girl want to get hitched, they can just elope in Vegas and nobody bats an eye, but if two gay people want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's splashed all over the national news.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Well, I'm here to give you a reality check - when you post something online, it's essentially public domain. You can't expect your personal opinions or actions to remain private. As someone who's dealt with this firsthand as a resident advisor, I can attest to the fact that anything you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. This can be particularly problematic when you're discussing sensitive or serious topics like violence or shootings. Someone, somewhere, will inevitably stumble upon it and react.\n\nThe internet is a vast, open space that's accessible to everyone, including your friends and acquaintances on social media platforms. Whether it's a bulletin on Myspace or a post on Facebook, it's not just a school or institution that's exposed to it - it's the entire online community. If something serious enough is posted, it can put people on high alert, and as you can imagine, schools and institutions can't just ignore these warnings.\n\nIt's a delicate line to walk because, on the one hand, some people might be joking or engaging in a social experiment, while others might be genuinely expressing their thoughts or concerns. Take the recent incident at our school, for example, where someone overheard a comment and reported it, leading to a deeper investigation. It turned out that a student had posted some concerning content on their social media profiles that they never intended to be taken seriously, but in hindsight, it became a serious issue.\n\nWhen you post something online, you should be aware that there's no such thing as true online privacy. If you don't want your thoughts or actions to be public knowledge, it's best not to post them in the first place. You can't control how people interpret your online presence, but you can control what you put out there. School officials, for instance, shouldn't be friending their students on social media or snooping through their profiles - that's just not their place.\n\nHowever, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a different story if they're monitoring private communications like phone conversations or texts without consent. But if it's something that's publicly available, they can't just ignore it.\n\nAs a residential advisor, I wouldn't even think of friending my residents on social media, not because I'm concerned about their online activities, but because I don't want to be privy to that information. That's not my place, and I'd rather not have to deal with the potential consequences. So, to sum it up, be mindful of what you post online because it can have real-world implications.",
            "I'm starting to feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the idea seemed to be a good one – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original goal. Instead, it feels like we're fighting for the sake of being a global superpower, just to prove a point. I'm also concerned that the real motives behind the war were questionable from the start, considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, as long as there weren't any personal agendas involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective in the first few months, and that was a significant statement in itself.\n\nThe fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, or even several years, is just too much. I believe our purpose has been slowly eroded over time, and it's now more about being at war for the sake of being at war. We're not looking for a decisive end or a victory; we just don't want to lose face.\n\nI think it's time for us to call it quits. The Iraqi government will eventually have to take care of itself, and our continued involvement is just draining our economy. We're spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose, while we have our own problems to address, such as poverty and internal issues like public roads, schools, and healthcare. It seems like a waste of resources to be spending that money on a war that's not achieving its original goal.\n\nIt's astounding to think that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not in our long-term budget. We have our own problems to solve at home, and it's time for us to focus on those. Our citizens are dying in a foreign country, and it's just not worth it.",
            "I wanted to clarify a point, but I'm not sure if I should even bring it up. Apparently, someone online discovered that there was a reason certain information was being kept from the public. Okay, so here's my question: if you post stuff on the internet, like on Myspace, for instance, you have to accept that a lot of people are going to see it. I mean, if you want to be friends with someone on Myspace, you basically give them permission to view your profile, right? So, anytime you put info on the internet, you have to understand that it's out there for anyone to see.\n\nIt's a bit of a tough situation because, on one hand, you can't have someone sitting around all day monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening, but on the other hand, it's like, what if they're just looking for evidence of someone doing something wrong? It's not clear-cut. I mean, I don't think it's right to have someone's job just to snoop through people's profiles, but I guess it depends on the circumstances.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's a bit unsettling to think that there are people out there who can see things about me just by looking at my profile. I saw this thing on TV once where this guy was showing how easy it is to get information about someone online. He went onto this girl's Myspace profile and got her screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. It's pretty scary.\n\nIt's hard to balance the fact that you want to be able to communicate with your friends online, but at the same time, you don't want to put too much information out there that could be used against you. I've noticed that some of my classmates can IM me without even knowing my screen name, which is a bit unnerving. They know a lot about me from my profile, including my class schedule and what my friends are like. I've tried to limit what I put up, but it's a tricky balance to strike.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she said that in her high school, students were banned from having Myspace accounts. I'm not sure how the school had the right to do that, and it seemed a bit unfair. I'm not sure if that's a real privacy issue, but it did strike me as strange.",
            "I struggled with whether to bring up the Iraq War topic, but I guess I have to eventually. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's not really a crucial issue anymore, as everyone except the Bush administration seems to agree that it was a bad idea. Looking at the recent polls, it's clear that the majority of the world population thinks so, with around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops in Iraq all sharing this sentiment. It's hard to argue with the fact that the conflict has been a disaster since before our involvement, and now it's a challenge to find a solution that won't make things worse.\n\nI believe the underlying issue is the deep cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern states, which makes it difficult for our administration to understand the local perspective. It's naive to think we can impose democracy on an area where it's not naturally embraced. While Saddam was a bad guy, we should have carefully weighed the pros and cons before invading. The situation has turned into a quagmire, and I don't see a reason for us to stay any longer. I'm not convinced by the administration's arguments about the potential problems that might arise from our withdrawal, and I'd love to hear a legitimate reason to stay.\n\nIf the administration plans to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I just can't see the justification for prolonging our presence. It's even more ironic that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're essentially telling us to leave. I think they might know better than us, and at least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the enemy in the Middle East.",
            "you know, i think gender discrimination is still an issue in the US.  it's not just a women's problem, though - it's more complex than that.  i believe it's often tied to the specific industry or work environment, and how long it's traditionally been male-dominated.  for instance, in business, women face a 'glass ceiling' where they might have all the qualifications for a job, but are overlooked for promotions due to ingrained societal attitudes. \n\nthe same can be said for men in certain industries, like fashion, where being a stay-at-home parent is often viewed as unusual and not masculine.  it's a common stereotype that men should be the breadwinners, and people look down on them if they choose to take on more domestic responsibilities.  this can be tough for men who want to be involved in childcare and support their families, but are judged for their choices. \n\nin fashion, there's also the issue of men being taken seriously if they're interested in it as a career.  people often doubt their credibility because of societal expectations around masculinity and style.  it's like, how can you truly understand fashion if you're a guy?  the same goes for men who don't fit the typical mold of masculinity.\n\nsocietal attitudes and mindsets are hard to change, and it's a slow process.  we've made progress, but it's still a work in progress.  women are breaking into leadership positions and being accepted in the business world, and more men are choosing to be stay-at-home dads.  as we continue to push for change, it's essential to promote the qualities and strengths of those who are often stereotyped or overlooked.  we need to do this in a way that's not pushy or aggressive, but rather by showcasing their abilities and potential. \n\nit's all about finding a balance and promoting acceptance, rather than forcing it.  we're at a good point where it's starting to become more mainstream, but change takes time.  i'm not sure what more we can do, as it seems like we're already seeing progress.  it's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and with varying levels of education can face discrimination, not just based on gender but also on other factors like socioeconomic status, education level, or geographical location.",
            "It seems that many people misunderstand the recent changes to the law regarding this substance.  To clarify, it was decriminalized, not fully legalized. In other words, it's no longer a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, akin to a traffic ticket. You might get cited and fined without facing the full penalties of arrest and prosecution.\n\nOne issue people often worry about when it comes to decriminalization is the potential long-term consequences, such as difficulties in job interviews and other professional situations. These repercussions can still linger even after decriminalization. However, some argue that the costs associated with arresting and processing individuals, including courtroom appearances and public defender fees, can be substantial.\n\nFrom a budgetary perspective, many municipalities struggle to justify the expense of enforcing this law. Even if it would lead to significant cost savings, some communities may not be willing to make this change, especially if they're strongly opposed to the substance.\n\nOn the other hand, places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, might find it reasonable to decriminalize it. As a result, they could potentially redirect funds to more pressing needs, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and services for the homeless.\n\nIt's essential to consider the financial implications, as well as other factors, when discussing this topic. While marijuana shouldn't be allowed to be ubiquitous, the financial element does play a role in the decision-making process. Some people might be concerned that if it were fully legalized, it could lead to widespread use and potentially problematic behaviors, like driving under the influence. However, it's also true that many people view marijuana as taboo, and making it widely available might be awkward for some.\n\nIn general, both marijuana and alcohol have their negative effects, but they can impact people differently. Some might be more susceptible to the lifestyle consequences of marijuana use, while others may be more affected by its impact on motor skills. Ultimately, everyone's reaction to substances is unique, and it's difficult to make broad generalizations.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree [REWRITE]However, [REWRITE]There are many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church that have remained consistent over time, and [REWRITE]it's great to see these enduring practices [REWRITE]But at the same time, it's essential to be open to change [REWRITE]Many Catholics adhere to the idea of attending church every week, and [REWRITE]they're quite particular about how things are done [REWRITE]Sometimes, though, I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine [REWRITE]Furthermore, they don't accept individuals who aren't flawless Catholics or those from other faiths [REWRITE]For example, my parents' interfaith marriage was not recognized in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background [REWRITE]This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, given the Catholic emphasis on loving others [REWRITE]It's like they're preaching one thing but not practicing it [REWRITE]The disconnect between doctrine and practice is a significant issue, especially when it's rooted in outdated ideas [REWRITE]Despite this, they continue to stick with these outdated practices [REWRITE]Personally, I think it would be beneficial to allow priests to marry [REWRITE]However, I'm not convinced that this would prevent pedophilic behavior [REWRITE]Those who engage in such acts likely wouldn't be deterred by marriage [REWRITE]It's a different dynamic altogether, and [REWRITE]I don't think allowing priests to be married would necessarily make a difference [REWRITE]In other words, child abuse is a separate issue that wouldn't be resolved by allowing priests to marry [REWRITE]It's a complex problem that requires a more comprehensive approach [REWRITE]",
            "so i haven't made up my mind on this yet, but it's a pretty tricky topic. the lines between separation of church and state are getting blurred, and defining marriage has become a really touchy issue. on one hand, you have civil unions, which i think are a good alternative, but on the other hand, you have this whole idea of marriage as a sacrament that's deeply rooted in faith. if that's the case, people don't get tax breaks or any special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. so i'm inclined to think that marriage should be viewed as a civil union, a union between two people, without any government interference in what that union is or isn't.\n\nthe thing is, the fact that gay marriage is even a debate is a bit of a non-starter. if two people want to get married, or enter into a civil union, it's really no one's business but theirs. and if the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should make it federal law. but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? that just seems like overkill. it's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution.\n\nit's not like it's some huge, earth-shattering cause that's worth amending the constitution over. it's just not that important. and to be honest, it's pretty ridiculous to try to define marriage in the constitution in the first place. i'm not even sure what to say to that.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to a somewhat mixed perspective on homosexuality for me. On one hand, I have many close gay friends, so it's hard for me to take a one-dimensional stance on the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't believe it's a matter for the federal government to decide; rather, each state should have the autonomy to make its own decision.\n\nConsidering the diversity of our country, with some states being more liberal and others more conservative, it's likely that each state will have its own stance on gay marriage. If you live in a state that has already legalized it, I don't think you should disagree with the decision, as you have chosen to reside there and should respect the local laws. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, and therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left up to individual states.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but to reiterate, I don't think the president should be able to impose their will on the entire country in regards to this issue. President Bush's ban on gay marriage doesn't sit well with me, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't dictate how each one runs itself. It would be more productive to let the states decide for themselves. Plus, with the president's term coming to an end soon, the issue will likely be revisited, and it's better to let each state make its own decision rather than having it change every time the presidency switches hands. It's the states that will have to live with the consequences of this decision, not the president.",
            "Honestly, I'm finding it difficult to articulate my thoughts on this issue. Let me break it down for you. MySpace, like the internet in general, is a public platform where you post content for others to see. If you put something online, you have to accept that people will view it, including school officials. Even if you post under a pseudonym, they could still access it from their homes. In a situation where it might prevent a school shooting, I believe they have every right to do so. Their primary responsibility is to ensure student safety.\n\nIn fact, if school officials monitor Myspace to identify students engaging in prohibited activities, I think that's perfectly fine. It's their job to maintain a safe environment, and if that means keeping an eye on students' online behavior, so be it. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and invading students' privacy. However, if the monitoring leads to a safer school environment, I don't consider it an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but I'll try to summarize. Posting on Myspace is like sharing information with the public. If you're worried about getting in trouble for something you post, it's not unreasonable. Once something is online, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. This is something I'm cautious about, even in emails.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, and if that means monitoring Myspace or other online platforms, I'm okay with it. In fact, I've discussed this with a teacher of mine, and they feel the same way. They have to be prepared for potential threats, like lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. In a way, this incident was similar, as they were trying to prevent something like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn short, I think school officials were justified in monitoring Myspace to ensure student safety. They were simply doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. That's all I wanted to say on the matter.",
            "I guess I've been a bit quiet lately because I'm still trying to process my thoughts on the war. To be honest, my initial reaction after 9/11 was to support it. I was personally affected, and I felt like we needed to take action and show them that their actions wouldn't be tolerated. I think we went in there with a lot of emotions and anger, which clouded our judgment. We didn't really think about the long-term consequences or have a clear plan, which ultimately led to things not going as smoothly as we had hoped.\n\nI've since changed my mind and I'm now firmly against the war. I don't think it's done anything to help the situation, and in fact, I think it's made things worse. The people over there are fighting amongst themselves, so us being there isn't really accomplishing anything. It's like they're more focused on fighting each other than working towards a common goal, and I just don't see how us being there is making a difference.\n\nTo be blunt, I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel like we're just throwing our money and lives away for no reason. I've come to realize that war is a completely different beast when you're not the one waging it. The people over there have a completely different mindset, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, but rather get rid of us.\n\nLooking back, I think we went in there on a mission of revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. I think President Bush was swept up in the emotional response to 9/11 and declared war on Iraq without a clear plan in place. At the time, I understood where he was coming from, but now I think we should have taken a more measured approach.\n\nI don't think we could have just let things go after 9/11, but I do think we could have done a better job of planning and executing our strategy. There was a lack of unity and clear direction, and that's something that would have made a big difference. As it stands, I think we're just making things worse and hurting ourselves more than anyone else.\n\nWe're not the ones to change the people over there; they're going to be who they are, and we're not going to be able to fix that. I think we're just delaying the inevitable by staying there, and it's time for us to leave. We're not making enough progress, and once we do leave, things will likely collapse. I think we're just wasting our time and resources by staying, and it's time to cut our losses."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "i think the catholic church really needs to reevaluate its stance on certain issues. they're experiencing a decline in followers, and i believe it's because they're not very accepting of a lot of things. for instance, their rigid views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are quite outdated and may be driving people away. if they adapted to a more modern perspective, they might not lose their followers. many people are turning against the church due to its traditional views on these matters. those who disagree with the church on these subjects may not feel comfortable being part of a community where such views are strongly emphasized. this could lead to people leaving the church because they feel they're going against its teachings. i don't see why the church can't reconsider its stance on issues like female priests or priests being able to get married. it's possible that if they allowed priests to have personal relationships, it might not have changed the outcome, but it's worth exploring. however, the church's stance on these topics seems archaic, and it's hard to understand why they can't find a middle ground. they claim that priests are married to god and devoted to their faith, but they're essentially denying them a normal life with a family and loved ones, just like everyone else.",
            "Honestly, I'll be the first to admit that I haven't fully given much thought to the issue of gay marriage. However, I'm not opposed to the idea in principle. I think people, regardless of their sexual orientation, shouldn't be held accountable for who they are. It's not like being gay is a choice that someone makes consciously. I believe people are born with their orientation, and it's not something they should be penalized for. To deny gay couples the right to marriage while allowing opposite-sex couples to do so just doesn't seem right to me.\n\nOn a deeper level, the idea that people's sexual orientation is not a choice seems obvious. Think about it - I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not as if they have control over it. This lack of control means they shouldn't be held responsible for who they are.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government shouldn't be involved in issues like this. It's not a matter of law or morality; it's simply about giving people the freedom to be who they are. I don't think it's fair to put people on a pedestal and imply they made a wrong decision or choice. Gay people aren't doing anything wrong; they're just existing and being themselves.\n\nFrankly, I think the federal government is out of place here. It's not a matter of national security or moral values; it's simply a matter of people's personal lives. They shouldn't be intervened in or judged based on their orientation. It's who they are, and that's not something they should be punished for.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "I'm in favor of legalizing gay marriage because there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but that's not true. It's like saying heads will never be tails - they're two sides of the same coin. While people may have different views on the matter, there are many civil rights at stake, such as property taxes, healthcare, and hospital visitation rights. If a gay couple is together, their partner shouldn't be denied the right to be with them in the hospital or visit them when they're sick.\n\nThe fact is, scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship, such as communication, trust, and commitment. It's not about getting married in a church; it's about obtaining a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, it's hard to argue against granting marriage to gay couples. It's essentially segregation, separate but unequal. People worry about adoption issues and community concerns, but these concerns are unfounded. Gay couples can be just as good parents as heterosexual couples, and their children will face the same challenges in school and society.\n\nIn fact, some cities, like New York, have already implemented programs to support children of gay parents, such as special schools to protect them from bullying and harassment. It's not about the parents' sexual orientation; it's about the quality of care and parenting skills.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is hypocritical, considering the government's stance on other issues, such as stem cell research and the Pledge of Allegiance. It's unacceptable to enforce religious standards on an entire country while ignoring the moral and cultural diversity of its citizens.\n\nSome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed. However, this is a misconception, as the American Psychological Association has refuted these claims. People should listen to institutions that conduct research and studies, rather than relying on popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Well, I've got a bit of a soapbox moment here, so bear with me. As a pharmacy intern in a hospital over the summer, I've had some time to think about the whole issue of illegal substances. Now, just because something's on the list of forbidden substances doesn't mean it's inherently bad. Take it for what it's worth, I think it's fair to say that some illegal drugs have real benefits.\n\nIn fact, pharmacies like the one I'm working at use controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets all the time because they're proven to help people. And let's be real, if we're going to dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana because of its illegality, that's just a cop-out. We should be able to explore its medicinal uses without fear of judgment.\n\nI'm not saying it's identical to alcohol, which can be abused and lead to all sorts of problems. But if we're honest, marijuana isn't exactly the same. If we could create a more nuanced view of marijuana, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, maybe people would use it more responsibly. After all, it's not like it's heroin or cocaine – it's not that toxic.\n\nMy point is, getting rid of the negative stigma surrounding marijuana might be the first step towards using it sensibly, especially for medicinal purposes. If we could move past the 'terrifying illicit substance' image, people might be more likely to use it in a way that's not detrimental to their health.",
            "To be honest, I think the church has made some adjustments to fit into the 21st century. It's not as traditional as it used to be. Growing up, I used to go to church every Sunday, and it was a big deal - I'd get dressed up in matching outfits, including a cute little dress, shoes, and a purse. It was a big part of my private school experience, where I'd see all my friends every weekend. However, as I've gotten older, I've noticed some changes. They've introduced a shorter, 30-minute mass for teenagers, and it's become more casual. People often dress down, especially in the summer, and even families who run late still show up. It's become a more relaxed atmosphere, even during morning masses where people used to dress up. I've noticed that people now wear jeans and khakis, which is still nice, but it's a more casual vibe overall.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me is the shift in the church's atmosphere. I'm not familiar with the church's politics, but that's my observation. As for the recent scandals involving Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who are still pedophiles, and it's not about the marriage or lack thereof - it's about the individual's attraction to young kids. When someone chooses to become a priest, it's their personal decision, and there are other faiths that allow their leaders to be married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, perhaps they should consider a different denomination.\n\nI was asked to elaborate on my answer, and I think it boils down to the idea that pedophilia is more about genetics than environmental factors. People are born with their inclinations, and you can't change that through marriage or any other means. If the church knew about these issues and covered them up, that's a problem, but I don't think they were aware of everything in all cases. As for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other comments.",
            "Honestly, at first, I wasn't entirely opposed to the premise, but looking back, I think the aftermath of the September 11th attacks was still a sensitive time, and we kind of got sidetracked into Iraq for reasons that weren't entirely genuine. The Bush administration initially linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had WMDs, but it's since been revealed that these claims were false.\n\nTo be frank, this really bothered me, and the Iraq war just gets my blood boiling. It seems to me that the Bush administration has lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it, even with Colin Powell admitting he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. That's a serious abuse of power and, in my opinion, an impeachable offense.\n\nIt's also disturbing to see the administration disregard the constitution and try to undermine it since 9/11. I think they came into office with the intention of going to war, despite the supposed pretext of WMDs and a connection to 9/11. In fact, it's been suggested that younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and that he wanted to expand our energy supply, which is a pretty underhanded motive.\n\nI think the war has dragged on for too long, but withdrawing now would have its own set of problems, as there's a risk that the country would descend into civil war and more people would lose their lives. The alternative seems to be a coalition of nearby nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to stabilize the situation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea either. It's likely to create more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty becomes an increasingly contentious issue. The interim government is already showing signs of disintegration, and the Parliament is ineffective, with the Prime Minister having little control. The presence of radical elements, like Mugtada al-Sadr's party with 20 seats in Parliament, is causing a lot of friction in the political process.\n\nTo be honest, I'm struggling to articulate my concerns in a polite manner.",
            "i was supposed to write something about my thoughts on the war in iraq, but it's really hard to form a coherent opinion on the topic. to be honest, i'm not even sure what's going on over there anymore. from what i understand, it started as a kind of get-back reaction because we thought iraq was behind the nine eleven attacks. but now it seems like we're just trying to set up a democracy in iraq, which sounds like a nice idea, but it's a lot harder to achieve than it sounds. \n\ni'm not really an expert on the war, but it seems like we're just causing more problems by being there. i mean, we're using a lot of resources, and it's making everyone upset. if we stay, we'll have to try and create a democracy, which will take a long time, and if we leave, they'll be mad at us for messing everything up. it's a tough spot to be in.\n\ni've been trying to think about this for a while, but it's just really hard to wrap my head around it. i don't even know if i should be calling it a war anymore, since it wasn't even declared by congress. i think that's how it's supposed to work, right? \n\ni guess my opinion is that it's a pointless thing to stay in iraq, but at the same time, i feel bad for all the families whose kids are over there fighting. it's like, i want them to be safe, but at the same time, we're kind of destroying their country and culture. it's hard to say what's the right thing to do. \n\ni feel like the war is going to go on for a long time, and it's just going to get worse and worse. it's already making us look bad, and it's just causing more and more problems. it's hard to know what to think, but i guess that's my two cents on the matter.\n\ni think the whole thing would be a lot simpler if we just declared it a war and got it over with, but that's not how it works. it's like, we're trying to turn iraq into a second u.s., but that's not going to work. it's just going to make things worse, and it's going to fuel the al-qaeda thing even more. i don't know, it's just a mess.\n\nanyway, that's my attempt at forming an opinion on the war in iraq. i'm not exactly sure what to think, but i hope that's a start.",
            "To be honest, I have strong reservations about the government declaring something as legal or not. I believe it's more the domain of churches to decide these matters, given the separation of church and state as outlined in the constitution. This principle is crystal clear, and any attempt to impose power over it would essentially defy the constitution's written words. \n\nIn my opinion, those trying to make it illegal are essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. The fact that most Catholics and Christians don't support it, except in a few areas, speaks volumes. It doesn't seem right for the government to dictate what churches can and can't make illegal.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Proposing an amendment to address this issue seems counterintuitive, as it would contradict the constitution's existing provisions. Furthermore, it would likely be the only amendment restricting individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs, which raises the concern that he's favoring one religion over others. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not the government or its officials. There's little justification for the amendment beyond personal views, and I fail to see how it would positively impact the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive effect on society, so I don't think there's a valid reason to pursue it.\n\nI've expressed my main points, so I'll leave it at that.",
            "Okay, I was thinking about the war in Iraq, and I believe the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for invading the country before going in. It seemed like there was an attempt to link the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, which wasn't entirely accurate. The government played on the emotions of the American people in the aftermath of 9/11 to justify the invasion, and it began in 2003.\n\nTo start, I'm not a fan of war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq has a lot of parallels with the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes and not repeated them. A huge number of American soldiers have lost their lives, which is tragic and unacceptable.\n\nWhen the US invaded Iraq, they removed the country's government without being prepared for the aftermath or the power vacuum that would follow. It's like trying to impose a democratic government without considering the potential consequences. They were trying to do the same thing in Vietnam, pushing out Communists and establishing democracy.\n\nHowever, the US government should have known that this would be a long and challenging process. It's not something that can be achieved easily, especially when you're fighting an insurgency rather than a conventional army. You're fighting ordinary citizens who are resisting the occupation, making it extremely difficult to put them down.\n\nI think the government rushed into war without being adequately prepared for the outcome, and that's been a major issue. If we're going to go to war, we need to plan for all possible outcomes. The government failed to do this, and we're still dealing with the consequences. Many American troops are still in Iraq, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to take control of their country.\n\nIn my opinion, the US government tried to deceive the American people by making it seem like the invasion would be a quick and successful operation. However, it's not that simple. Implementing a new form of government takes time, and it's not something that can be achieved overnight. We're naive to think it would be easy, especially when we consider our own country's history with democracy.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated issue, and there's no easy solution. If I had to vote in the 2004 presidential election, one of my reservations about voting for George Bush was that he would finish what he started. However, it's hard to abandon a country after being involved for so long, especially when we've taken away their government and way of life.\n\nOn the other hand, it's impossible to ignore the number of American casualties and the risk of further losses. We need to consider the cost of continuing the war and whether it's worth it for the sake of a free democratic Iraq. If we're making the case that Iraq needs democracy, why aren't we doing the same for other countries? I think the real reason is the oil issue and controlling resources. The US government's decisions are often driven by self-interest and a desire for power.\n\nIn conclusion, I just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and that peace is restored. However, I'm not optimistic about the situation, and it's likely that it will take a long time to resolve.",
            "Well, let me get this straight - I'm all for gay marriage, I've always been. It's a personal choice, and I think it's ridiculous that people are still debating this. With all the evidence that shows it's not just a social construct, but something that could be biological, it's inhumane to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nI'm not sure why the government and politicians are even involved in this. It's a personal issue, not a state or national concern. I mean, take my neighborhood for instance - there are at least two openly gay couples living there, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, go about their daily lives, and what's the difference? I think it's absurd that President Bush is trying to dictate what marriage means and imposing his own interpretation on the rest of us.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's a growing body of evidence that suggests there's a chemical component to being gay, something that's not just a product of upbringing or environment. It's not like being gay is a choice, it's a natural part of who people are. So, I just don't get why it's such a big deal.\n\nIt's not like straight couples need to jump through hoops to get married. If a guy and a girl want to get hitched, they can just elope in Vegas and nobody bats an eye, but if two gay people want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that's splashed all over the national news.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Well, I'm here to give you a reality check - when you post something online, it's essentially public domain. You can't expect your personal opinions or actions to remain private. As someone who's dealt with this firsthand as a resident advisor, I can attest to the fact that anything you put out there can shape people's perceptions of you. This can be particularly problematic when you're discussing sensitive or serious topics like violence or shootings. Someone, somewhere, will inevitably stumble upon it and react.\n\nThe internet is a vast, open space that's accessible to everyone, including your friends and acquaintances on social media platforms. Whether it's a bulletin on Myspace or a post on Facebook, it's not just a school or institution that's exposed to it - it's the entire online community. If something serious enough is posted, it can put people on high alert, and as you can imagine, schools and institutions can't just ignore these warnings.\n\nIt's a delicate line to walk because, on the one hand, some people might be joking or engaging in a social experiment, while others might be genuinely expressing their thoughts or concerns. Take the recent incident at our school, for example, where someone overheard a comment and reported it, leading to a deeper investigation. It turned out that a student had posted some concerning content on their social media profiles that they never intended to be taken seriously, but in hindsight, it became a serious issue.\n\nWhen you post something online, you should be aware that there's no such thing as true online privacy. If you don't want your thoughts or actions to be public knowledge, it's best not to post them in the first place. You can't control how people interpret your online presence, but you can control what you put out there. School officials, for instance, shouldn't be friending their students on social media or snooping through their profiles - that's just not their place.\n\nHowever, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. It's a different story if they're monitoring private communications like phone conversations or texts without consent. But if it's something that's publicly available, they can't just ignore it.\n\nAs a residential advisor, I wouldn't even think of friending my residents on social media, not because I'm concerned about their online activities, but because I don't want to be privy to that information. That's not my place, and I'd rather not have to deal with the potential consequences. So, to sum it up, be mindful of what you post online because it can have real-world implications.",
            "I'm starting to feel like the war has dragged on for far too long. Initially, the idea seemed to be a good one – to bring democracy to a country in need. However, it seems like we've lost sight of that original goal. Instead, it feels like we're fighting for the sake of being a global superpower, just to prove a point. I'm also concerned that the real motives behind the war were questionable from the start, considering George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf our goal was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would have been a justifiable reason, as long as there weren't any personal agendas involved. However, I think we achieved our initial objective in the first few months, and that was a significant statement in itself.\n\nThe fact that the war has dragged on for over a year, or even several years, is just too much. I believe our purpose has been slowly eroded over time, and it's now more about being at war for the sake of being at war. We're not looking for a decisive end or a victory; we just don't want to lose face.\n\nI think it's time for us to call it quits. The Iraqi government will eventually have to take care of itself, and our continued involvement is just draining our economy. We're spending billions of dollars on a war that's lost its purpose, while we have our own problems to address, such as poverty and internal issues like public roads, schools, and healthcare. It seems like a waste of resources to be spending that money on a war that's not achieving its original goal.\n\nIt's astounding to think that we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a war that's not in our long-term budget. We have our own problems to solve at home, and it's time for us to focus on those. Our citizens are dying in a foreign country, and it's just not worth it.",
            "I wanted to clarify a point, but I'm not sure if I should even bring it up. Apparently, someone online discovered that there was a reason certain information was being kept from the public. Okay, so here's my question: if you post stuff on the internet, like on Myspace, for instance, you have to accept that a lot of people are going to see it. I mean, if you want to be friends with someone on Myspace, you basically give them permission to view your profile, right? So, anytime you put info on the internet, you have to understand that it's out there for anyone to see.\n\nIt's a bit of a tough situation because, on one hand, you can't have someone sitting around all day monitoring everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening, but on the other hand, it's like, what if they're just looking for evidence of someone doing something wrong? It's not clear-cut. I mean, I don't think it's right to have someone's job just to snoop through people's profiles, but I guess it depends on the circumstances.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a Myspace account, but I do have a Facebook one. It's a bit unsettling to think that there are people out there who can see things about me just by looking at my profile. I saw this thing on TV once where this guy was showing how easy it is to get information about someone online. He went onto this girl's Myspace profile and got her screen name in like a minute and started talking to her on instant messenger. It's pretty scary.\n\nIt's hard to balance the fact that you want to be able to communicate with your friends online, but at the same time, you don't want to put too much information out there that could be used against you. I've noticed that some of my classmates can IM me without even knowing my screen name, which is a bit unnerving. They know a lot about me from my profile, including my class schedule and what my friends are like. I've tried to limit what I put up, but it's a tricky balance to strike.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this, and she said that in her high school, students were banned from having Myspace accounts. I'm not sure how the school had the right to do that, and it seemed a bit unfair. I'm not sure if that's a real privacy issue, but it did strike me as strange.",
            "I struggled with whether to bring up the Iraq War topic, but I guess I have to eventually. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, as I don't want to jump on the bandwagon of people who claim they were against it from the start. However, it's not really a crucial issue anymore, as everyone except the Bush administration seems to agree that it was a bad idea. Looking at the recent polls, it's clear that the majority of the world population thinks so, with around 75-80% of the global population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops in Iraq all sharing this sentiment. It's hard to argue with the fact that the conflict has been a disaster since before our involvement, and now it's a challenge to find a solution that won't make things worse.\n\nI believe the underlying issue is the deep cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern states, which makes it difficult for our administration to understand the local perspective. It's naive to think we can impose democracy on an area where it's not naturally embraced. While Saddam was a bad guy, we should have carefully weighed the pros and cons before invading. The situation has turned into a quagmire, and I don't see a reason for us to stay any longer. I'm not convinced by the administration's arguments about the potential problems that might arise from our withdrawal, and I'd love to hear a legitimate reason to stay.\n\nIf the administration plans to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I just can't see the justification for prolonging our presence. It's even more ironic that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with a quarter of them wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and they're essentially telling us to leave. I think they might know better than us, and at least if we ask them and they say yes, we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help out after that, we'll at least be seen as the lesser of two evils, rather than the enemy in the Middle East.",
            "you know, i think gender discrimination is still an issue in the US.  it's not just a women's problem, though - it's more complex than that.  i believe it's often tied to the specific industry or work environment, and how long it's traditionally been male-dominated.  for instance, in business, women face a 'glass ceiling' where they might have all the qualifications for a job, but are overlooked for promotions due to ingrained societal attitudes. \n\nthe same can be said for men in certain industries, like fashion, where being a stay-at-home parent is often viewed as unusual and not masculine.  it's a common stereotype that men should be the breadwinners, and people look down on them if they choose to take on more domestic responsibilities.  this can be tough for men who want to be involved in childcare and support their families, but are judged for their choices. \n\nin fashion, there's also the issue of men being taken seriously if they're interested in it as a career.  people often doubt their credibility because of societal expectations around masculinity and style.  it's like, how can you truly understand fashion if you're a guy?  the same goes for men who don't fit the typical mold of masculinity.\n\nsocietal attitudes and mindsets are hard to change, and it's a slow process.  we've made progress, but it's still a work in progress.  women are breaking into leadership positions and being accepted in the business world, and more men are choosing to be stay-at-home dads.  as we continue to push for change, it's essential to promote the qualities and strengths of those who are often stereotyped or overlooked.  we need to do this in a way that's not pushy or aggressive, but rather by showcasing their abilities and potential. \n\nit's all about finding a balance and promoting acceptance, rather than forcing it.  we're at a good point where it's starting to become more mainstream, but change takes time.  i'm not sure what more we can do, as it seems like we're already seeing progress.  it's also worth noting that people from different backgrounds and with varying levels of education can face discrimination, not just based on gender but also on other factors like socioeconomic status, education level, or geographical location.",
            "It seems that many people misunderstand the recent changes to the law regarding this substance.  To clarify, it was decriminalized, not fully legalized. In other words, it's no longer a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, akin to a traffic ticket. You might get cited and fined without facing the full penalties of arrest and prosecution.\n\nOne issue people often worry about when it comes to decriminalization is the potential long-term consequences, such as difficulties in job interviews and other professional situations. These repercussions can still linger even after decriminalization. However, some argue that the costs associated with arresting and processing individuals, including courtroom appearances and public defender fees, can be substantial.\n\nFrom a budgetary perspective, many municipalities struggle to justify the expense of enforcing this law. Even if it would lead to significant cost savings, some communities may not be willing to make this change, especially if they're strongly opposed to the substance.\n\nOn the other hand, places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, might find it reasonable to decriminalize it. As a result, they could potentially redirect funds to more pressing needs, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and services for the homeless.\n\nIt's essential to consider the financial implications, as well as other factors, when discussing this topic. While marijuana shouldn't be allowed to be ubiquitous, the financial element does play a role in the decision-making process. Some people might be concerned that if it were fully legalized, it could lead to widespread use and potentially problematic behaviors, like driving under the influence. However, it's also true that many people view marijuana as taboo, and making it widely available might be awkward for some.\n\nIn general, both marijuana and alcohol have their negative effects, but they can impact people differently. Some might be more susceptible to the lifestyle consequences of marijuana use, while others may be more affected by its impact on motor skills. Ultimately, everyone's reaction to substances is unique, and it's difficult to make broad generalizations.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree [REWRITE]However, [REWRITE]There are many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church that have remained consistent over time, and [REWRITE]it's great to see these enduring practices [REWRITE]But at the same time, it's essential to be open to change [REWRITE]Many Catholics adhere to the idea of attending church every week, and [REWRITE]they're quite particular about how things are done [REWRITE]Sometimes, though, I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine [REWRITE]Furthermore, they don't accept individuals who aren't flawless Catholics or those from other faiths [REWRITE]For example, my parents' interfaith marriage was not recognized in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian background [REWRITE]This lack of tolerance seems hypocritical, given the Catholic emphasis on loving others [REWRITE]It's like they're preaching one thing but not practicing it [REWRITE]The disconnect between doctrine and practice is a significant issue, especially when it's rooted in outdated ideas [REWRITE]Despite this, they continue to stick with these outdated practices [REWRITE]Personally, I think it would be beneficial to allow priests to marry [REWRITE]However, I'm not convinced that this would prevent pedophilic behavior [REWRITE]Those who engage in such acts likely wouldn't be deterred by marriage [REWRITE]It's a different dynamic altogether, and [REWRITE]I don't think allowing priests to be married would necessarily make a difference [REWRITE]In other words, child abuse is a separate issue that wouldn't be resolved by allowing priests to marry [REWRITE]It's a complex problem that requires a more comprehensive approach [REWRITE]",
            "so i haven't made up my mind on this yet, but it's a pretty tricky topic. the lines between separation of church and state are getting blurred, and defining marriage has become a really touchy issue. on one hand, you have civil unions, which i think are a good alternative, but on the other hand, you have this whole idea of marriage as a sacrament that's deeply rooted in faith. if that's the case, people don't get tax breaks or any special treatment from the government just because they're baptized. so i'm inclined to think that marriage should be viewed as a civil union, a union between two people, without any government interference in what that union is or isn't.\n\nthe thing is, the fact that gay marriage is even a debate is a bit of a non-starter. if two people want to get married, or enter into a civil union, it's really no one's business but theirs. and if the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should make it federal law. but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? that just seems like overkill. it's not a big enough issue to warrant changing the constitution.\n\nit's not like it's some huge, earth-shattering cause that's worth amending the constitution over. it's just not that important. and to be honest, it's pretty ridiculous to try to define marriage in the constitution in the first place. i'm not even sure what to say to that.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to a somewhat mixed perspective on homosexuality for me. On one hand, I have many close gay friends, so it's hard for me to take a one-dimensional stance on the issue. While I don't necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I don't believe it's a matter for the federal government to decide; rather, each state should have the autonomy to make its own decision.\n\nConsidering the diversity of our country, with some states being more liberal and others more conservative, it's likely that each state will have its own stance on gay marriage. If you live in a state that has already legalized it, I don't think you should disagree with the decision, as you have chosen to reside there and should respect the local laws. My opinion is that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals, and therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left up to individual states.\n\nI've already touched on this point, but to reiterate, I don't think the president should be able to impose their will on the entire country in regards to this issue. President Bush's ban on gay marriage doesn't sit well with me, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't dictate how each one runs itself. It would be more productive to let the states decide for themselves. Plus, with the president's term coming to an end soon, the issue will likely be revisited, and it's better to let each state make its own decision rather than having it change every time the presidency switches hands. It's the states that will have to live with the consequences of this decision, not the president.",
            "Honestly, I'm finding it difficult to articulate my thoughts on this issue. Let me break it down for you. MySpace, like the internet in general, is a public platform where you post content for others to see. If you put something online, you have to accept that people will view it, including school officials. Even if you post under a pseudonym, they could still access it from their homes. In a situation where it might prevent a school shooting, I believe they have every right to do so. Their primary responsibility is to ensure student safety.\n\nIn fact, if school officials monitor Myspace to identify students engaging in prohibited activities, I think that's perfectly fine. It's their job to maintain a safe environment, and if that means keeping an eye on students' online behavior, so be it. Of course, there's a fine line between monitoring and invading students' privacy. However, if the monitoring leads to a safer school environment, I don't consider it an invasion of privacy.\n\nIt's a lot easier to express yourself in writing, but I'll try to summarize. Posting on Myspace is like sharing information with the public. If you're worried about getting in trouble for something you post, it's not unreasonable. Once something is online, it's there forever, and you can't take it back. This is something I'm cautious about, even in emails.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, and if that means monitoring Myspace or other online platforms, I'm okay with it. In fact, I've discussed this with a teacher of mine, and they feel the same way. They have to be prepared for potential threats, like lockdown drills in case of a terrorist attack. In a way, this incident was similar, as they were trying to prevent something like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn short, I think school officials were justified in monitoring Myspace to ensure student safety. They were simply doing their job to prevent something bad from happening. That's all I wanted to say on the matter.",
            "I guess I've been a bit quiet lately because I'm still trying to process my thoughts on the war. To be honest, my initial reaction after 9/11 was to support it. I was personally affected, and I felt like we needed to take action and show them that their actions wouldn't be tolerated. I think we went in there with a lot of emotions and anger, which clouded our judgment. We didn't really think about the long-term consequences or have a clear plan, which ultimately led to things not going as smoothly as we had hoped.\n\nI've since changed my mind and I'm now firmly against the war. I don't think it's done anything to help the situation, and in fact, I think it's made things worse. The people over there are fighting amongst themselves, so us being there isn't really accomplishing anything. It's like they're more focused on fighting each other than working towards a common goal, and I just don't see how us being there is making a difference.\n\nTo be blunt, I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel like we're just throwing our money and lives away for no reason. I've come to realize that war is a completely different beast when you're not the one waging it. The people over there have a completely different mindset, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, but rather get rid of us.\n\nLooking back, I think we went in there on a mission of revenge rather than a rational, well-thought-out plan. I think President Bush was swept up in the emotional response to 9/11 and declared war on Iraq without a clear plan in place. At the time, I understood where he was coming from, but now I think we should have taken a more measured approach.\n\nI don't think we could have just let things go after 9/11, but I do think we could have done a better job of planning and executing our strategy. There was a lack of unity and clear direction, and that's something that would have made a big difference. As it stands, I think we're just making things worse and hurting ourselves more than anyone else.\n\nWe're not the ones to change the people over there; they're going to be who they are, and we're not going to be able to fix that. I think we're just delaying the inevitable by staying there, and it's time for us to leave. We're not making enough progress, and once we do leave, things will likely collapse. I think we're just wasting our time and resources by staying, and it's time to cut our losses."
