            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to reassess its stance on several issues. Many people have been discussing the decline in the Church's following, and I believe it's because the Church is often not very accepting of various things.\n\nFor instance, their views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control are quite rigid, which is understandable, but also somewhat outdated. If the Church were to be more open to modern perspectives, it wouldn't lose its followers. Instead, people are starting to turn against the Church's stance on these issues and view them as outdated.\n\nSome individuals are even choosing not to follow the Church because of its views on topics like abortion and gay marriage. The Church's stance against abortion means that those who support it might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. Similarly, those who believe in and want to practice gay marriage might not feel at home in a community that doesn't support it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented the Church's problems entirely. Perhaps allowing priests to be married or having female priests might have changed things, but it's hard to say for certain.\n\nThe idea that priests can't be married because they're \"married to God\" doesn't sit well with me. Everyone else in the world has a job and a personal life, so why can't priests have both? It's a bit illogical to expect them to dedicate their entire lives to the Church without any personal relationships.",
            "I haven't really been able to articulate my thoughts on the issue of gay marriage, but I wanted to take a moment to share my perspective. To be clear, I don't have any issue with gay marriage in general. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose, but rather something they're born with. So, I don't think it's fair to hold them accountable for it. It seems to me that it's not a matter of personal choice, but rather a fundamental aspect of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, I do believe it's unjust to deny gay couples the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation. It's not like they've made a conscious decision to be gay; they're just being themselves. I think it's essential to recognize and respect that.\n\nIn my view, the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral concerns. It's simply a personal matter that doesn't affect anyone else. I think it's unfair for the government to interfere in people's private lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as their relationships and identities. Let's face it, people are born gay, and they shouldn't be punished for being themselves.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "i think that gay marriage should be legalized. here's why: there's just no good reason not to. people often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's really not the same thing. it's like comparing apples and oranges - two different sides of the same coin. you can't have heads without tails, and the same goes for these relationships. they're just as valid, with their own set of civil rights, like property taxes and healthcare benefits. for example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital because they're not considered family, which is pretty silly considering you're planning to spend the rest of your life together. research has shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as straight couples do.\n\nthe issue is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church - they're asking for a legal marriage certificate from the government. this should be a no-brainer, especially if you consider it's a civil union, not a religious one. it's like segregation - separate but equal. they're asking for the same rights and recognition as straight couples.\n\npeople worry about things like adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. they're concerned about how gay couples will be perceived by society, and whether or not their children will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. but this is a new issue, and it's hard to say for sure. the main concern is how children of gay parents will be treated by their peers and other adults. in places like new york city, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied and harassed in public schools. this is just cruel.\n\nresearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of parenting as straight couples. it's really just a matter of personal choice, not sexual orientation. the federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. the amendment against it is just a form of hypocrisy, considering the controversy over the pledge of allegiance and government enforcing religious standards on the country.\n\nsome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is just not true. the american psychological association has debunked this claim, and people should be listening to research and studies, not just popular opinion and their neighbors' views. if we listened to experts, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I'm still working at the hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I had some thoughts on this topic. Just because a particular substance is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have potential benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the general public, no way, not at all. However, if we can use it for medicinal purposes, then I think that's a different story.\n\nThe thing is, some medications that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are still used in pharmacies because they're beneficial, despite their illegitimate status. If we dismiss marijuana's benefits just because there's a stigma surrounding it, that's just pointless. I think we should give its potential benefits some consideration.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is comparable to alcohol, though. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, whereas excessive alcohol consumption can have even worse consequences. Integrating marijuana into society in a controlled manner might be a viable option, but it would require some adjustments. We need to address the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople tend to have a negative perception of marijuana because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as hazardous as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might use it more responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone some significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's a lot less strict than it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was a routine I followed, even when I was at private school, where I'd see my friends on weekends. But things have changed, and the church has introduced a more laid-back atmosphere. They've even created a \"teenager mass\" that's only 30 minutes long, which has made things more casual. People now show up in their beach clothes during the summer, and even families who are running late are welcome. The morning masses, where I used to dress up, are now more relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. It's definitely a more casual vibe.\n\nTo be honest, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I'm not too familiar with the church's inner workings, but that's my observation. \n\nRegarding the recent accusations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and it's their personal choice to act on their attraction to young kids. It's not about their marital status; it's about the individual's character. I also believe that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nSome religions allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh-Day Adventists, and their reverends or ministers are still expected to adhere to their faith. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different denomination. \n\nTo elaborate, I think the key factor in pedophilia is genetics, rather than upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some factors might contribute, I believe people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed through marriage or any other means. The church, in this case, couldn't have done much to prevent these incidents, especially if they were not aware of the situations. If they were aware and chose to cover it up, that's a different story.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have much to add.",
            "I have to say, I initially found the idea [insert premise] somewhat acceptable, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and it seemed like we went into Iraq under the guise of a pretext. I believe the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really ruffled my feathers, and the Iraq war has become a contentious issue for me. It seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave a key presentation at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is a serious breach of trust and raises questions about accountability.\n\nIt's become clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the Constitution and has been working to undermine it since at least 9/11. I believe they came into office with the intention of going to war, and their actions suggest that they were motivated by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein. The younger Bush may have had a personal score to settle with Saddam, possibly due to his father's administration, and may have been hoping to expand our energy supplies.\n\nI think it's time for the war to end, but I'm concerned that withdrawal would lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative appears to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order. However, I'm skeptical about this approach, as it may create more problems in the long run, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to exert control, with radical elements vying for power.\n\nI'm not sure I have a solution that I can articulate in polite company, but I'm certainly vocal about my skepticism regarding the war and its aftermath.",
            "I haven't posted in a while, so I wanted to weigh in on the War in Iraq. To be honest, I'm not sure how to articulate my views because I don't really follow the intricacies of the conflict. From what I've gathered, it seems like we're still there more or less out of a desire to establish a democratic government, similar to our own, and to secure access to their oil reserves. However, this endeavor has been met with widespread discontent. The problem is, if we stay, we risk facing a prolonged and difficult process of nation-building, only to potentially leave behind a power vacuum that could lead to further conflict. On the other hand, if we withdraw, the people of Iraq will likely be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, which could also lead to resentment towards the US. At this point, I'm struggling to see a clear-cut solution.\n\nTo be blunt, I think it's time to reevaluate our involvement in the conflict. Let's be honest, the US didn't declare a formal war, so it's hard to justify the ongoing occupation. And even if we did, I'm not convinced that our presence is doing more good than harm. The resources we're expending could be better spent elsewhere, and the situation is causing President Bush a lot of grief. I'm reminded of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared conflict that's now widely regarded as a meaningless war. If history repeats itself, Bush risks being remembered as the president who initiated a similarly fruitless conflict.\n\nIt's also worth considering the human cost. There are families I know who have loved ones serving in Iraq, and it's hard to reconcile the desire to support them with the knowledge that our continued presence is causing them harm. However, I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be attempting to impose our own values and way of life on the Iraqi people, which could lead to even more resentment and division. The Al-Qaeda threat is also a concern, as our presence may only serve to fuel their hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight. That's my take on the situation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not thrilled about this, but it doesn't feel right for a state to make it legal. In my opinion, it's more the churches' decision, given the constitution's separation of church and state clause. It's quite clear in there, and I think trying to impose power over it would be a direct defiance of what's been established. \n\nThose pushing for it to be made illegal seem to be choosing one church's beliefs over another, especially considering most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't dictate as law.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even proposing an amendment on this seems wrong, as it goes against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why they're pushing for this amendment, other than it aligns with the president's own Catholic beliefs. This just shows a preference for one religion over others, which isn't right. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There's no real reason behind the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've made my point clear, so I'll stop there.",
            "Well, let's get to the point - I'm still trying to wrap my head around the war in Iraq. I think the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. It seemed like they tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but that was a bit of a stretch. Emotions were high after 9/11, and the government played on that to justify the war. \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of war, especially pre-emptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from those experiences. The number of American soldiers who have died is staggering, and it's heartbreaking. Removing a country's government without being prepared for the aftermath can lead to chaos and power vacuums, which is exactly what happened in Iraq.\n\nThe US government was trying to implant a democratic government, but that's a long and difficult process. It's not something that can be achieved overnight, and it's not as simple as pushing out one government and replacing it with another. The US should have known that the road to democracy in Iraq would be long and hard, but they seemed to downplay that. \n\nI think the government was not adequately prepared for the insurgency that arose, and that's a major reason why we're still in Iraq today. It's not a clear-cut victory like they initially thought it would be. Fighting an insurgency is tough, especially when you're fighting the very citizens of the country. It's a difficult situation, and I think the government underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nIf the government was going to go to war, they should have planned for all possible outcomes. They didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there. Many American troops have died, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to secure their own country. It's a long and difficult process, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be easy.\n\nThe reason we're in Iraq is a complex one, but I think it's largely about oil and controlling resources. The initial reason for the invasion was to find weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had those types of weapons, haven't faced the same level of aggression. It's a bit hypocritical, and I think the US government isn't being honest about its motivations.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. Unfortunately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.",
            "Honestly, I think I'm pretty clear on where I stand when it comes to gay marriage. I've always been a supporter, and I believe it's a matter of personal preference. Research has shown that homosexuality may have a biological basis, rather than being solely a product of upbringing, so it's unfair to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI think it's inhumane to treat people differently based on their sexual orientation, especially when it's not something they can change. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government should stay out of it – it's a personal issue, not a political one. Even at the state level, marriage is often seen as a personal choice, not a matter for the government to dictate.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who lead regular lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks, go about their daily business, and don't deserve to be treated any differently. I find it ridiculous that the current administration is trying to impose its own interpretation of what marriage should be.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing. This is a biological factor, not a social one, and it's unfair to penalize people for something they can't control.\n\nOne of the main issues I have is that marriage is a private matter, but only straight couples seem to have that privilege. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly in a place like Las Vegas, but if a gay couple wants to make the same commitment, it's splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think that's a double standard that needs to be addressed.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a personal, private choice, rather than a matter of public debate and government intervention.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure where to start, but I'll try to clarify something here. When you post something online, it becomes a public forum, completely open to everyone's view. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this issue in the past. You see, once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, it's only a matter of time before someone takes notice. You can't control what people think or say when they see that content online, and it's not like you can retract it either.\n\nThe internet is a public space, visible to anyone, and if your friends have you connected on platforms like Myspace, they'll likely see whatever you post. It's not the school that's accessing that information, but rather someone who's brought it to their attention. Since they can't just ignore it, they have to take action to prevent any potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just a joke, but that's why it's essential to be mindful of what you post online.\n\nWhat happened at our school was a great example of this. Someone overheard something that sounded alarming, and when we investigated, we found out it was just a misinterpreted joke. However, in the heat of the moment, it became a serious concern. When you post something online, you're essentially waiving your right to privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to form an opinion about you, don't share your thoughts online.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friending their students on social media platforms or snooping around their online activities. That's just not right. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. We shouldn't be monitoring private conversations or texts, but if it's brought to our attention, we have to address it. A good rule of thumb is to avoid creating fake online accounts or friending students under different names – that's just not a good idea.\n\nAs an RA, I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially when they post about it online. I'd rather not have that level of connection with them. It's not my place to know, and it's not my responsibility to police their behavior. That's just not what I signed up for.",
            "i'm getting the feeling that this war has dragged on for far too long. \noriginally, the goal was commendable - to bring democracy to a country in need of it. \nbut it's clear we've strayed from that purpose a long time ago. \nnow, it seems like we're fighting just to prove a point, to show off our military might. \ni'm not so sure about the motivations behind this war from the start, especially considering george bush's senior's past issues with saddam hussein. \nif the goal was to introduce democracy to a country with a flawed political system, that would be a valid reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. \nin my opinion, it's been a drawn-out conflict \ni think we made our point in the first few months, simply by starting the war - it was a statement in itself. \nbut the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year, maybe even years, just seems like a waste of time. \nif we were genuinely trying to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. \nhowever, over time, our reasons for fighting seem to have been lost and misconstrued. \nit appears we're still at war, simply because we don't want to stop fighting. \ni think it's time to bring this to an end, for the sake of our own economy and resources. \nwe've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, while neglecting our own internal issues, like poverty and underfunding for essential services like education and healthcare. \ni believe we should be spending our money on domestic problems, rather than a war that's lost its purpose. \nultimately, it's time for the government of the country we're involved in to take responsibility for themselves, and for us to focus on our own problems at home.",
            "I was wondering if I could clarify something. It seems that someone was able to access information online that ended up preventing a potentially serious situation. \n\nTo be honest, if you're posting information on the internet, it's generally fair game for anyone to see. On platforms like Myspace, for instance, you have to grant access to your profile by adding someone as a friend. When you do that, you're essentially giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it's safe to say that if someone stumbles upon your online presence, you should be aware that many people will see what you've posted. It's just the way the internet works. In this particular case, I actually think it's good that someone was able to prevent a potential issue.\n\nHowever, it does raise some complex questions. On one hand, it's not feasible to have someone constantly monitoring every student's online activity to prevent problems. But on the other hand, if they're focusing on specific individuals, it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is, but it seems like it would depend on the specific circumstances. Was the person simply browsing randomly, or were they actively searching for something? If it's the latter, it's a bit more understandable.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook and I'm aware of the potential risks. There are people out there who can access a lot of information about me, and I've seen cases where people have been able to gather info quickly. It's a bit unnerving, to say the least.\n\nI do try to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. You never really know who might be viewing your online activity.\n\nI did hear a story about a high school that banned students from having Myspace accounts. To be honest, I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to make that decision. It's a bit of a gray area when it comes to online privacy.",
            "I'm not sure if I'm going to get into this, but I guess I have to mention the Iraq War one more time. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, but I'll try to get it out. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The fact is, pretty much everyone, including the administration, now agrees that the war was a bad idea - except they don't want to admit they made a mistake. It's clear from recent polls that the overwhelming majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis, U.S. troops, and even global citizens, think the war was a bad idea. In fact, a staggering 75 to 80 percent of people worldwide, 80 percent of Iraqis, and 70 percent of U.S. troops in Iraq believe we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's been a complete disaster from the very beginning, and now it seems like pulling out will also be a challenge. The Middle East is just too complex, with a huge cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states. It's simply unrealistic to think we can impose democracy in an area where it's not necessarily wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. I just don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq; the administration's ideas on why it's better to stay seem flawed, and I haven't seen a legitimate reason to stay longer.\n\nIf we want to leave gradually over the course of a year or more, I wouldn't have a huge problem with that. However, I just don't see why we can't leave now. A recent statistic I came across showed that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with at least a quarter wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and it's hard to ignore their wishes. If we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our decision if things go badly. If we decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as trying to do the right thing, even if we're not entirely successful.",
            "I wanted to share my thoughts on the issue of gender discrimination in the United States. To be honest, I think it's still a big problem. Not just for women, but also in certain fields of work. The thing is, even though we're supposed to be equal, many people still struggle to find opportunities to work under a woman, simply because of how society has been conditioned over the years. \n\nIn the workplace, women often have the skills and qualifications for a particular job, but they might not get promoted because of the way things have always been done. It's not just about women, though; men can face similar issues in industries like fashion or when taking time off to care for their families. People tend to look down on men who choose to stay at home and raise their kids, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be tough on them, especially if they've always wanted to be involved in their children's lives.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where men can face discrimination. If a man is passionate about fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume it's a female-dominated field. This is partly because men who are into fashion are often seen as not being like other guys. It's hard to understand how they can truly relate to women's fashion when they have a different style of life.\n\nIn my opinion, gender discrimination is a problem in various fields, and it's not easy to change. Society has a set mindset that's hard to shift, but we're making progress. We've seen women breaking into leadership roles and becoming CEOs, and it's slowly becoming more accepted. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted, as people realize that women's careers can be just as valuable.\n\nTo promote change, I think we need to highlight the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be pushy or forceful, but rather showcase their strengths in a way that resonates with people. If we try to change too quickly, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now, where we're starting to make progress without pushing too hard. It's all about finding that balance and letting things unfold naturally.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, education, or even their grammar, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might face prejudice because of their regional accent or lack of formal education, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Similarly, men can be discriminated against by other men based on their background or education level.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that gender discrimination is a complex issue that affects people in different ways, and it's not just about women. We need to recognize this and work together to create a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "Well, I think people misunderstand the concept. They're not advocating for full legalization, but rather decriminalization. This essentially changes the penalty from a serious crime to a minor infraction, much like a traffic ticket. You'd get a citation rather than being arrested and taken in. This is a significant difference, especially for those who worry about future consequences, such as job interviews and the like. These repercussions might not entirely disappear with decriminalization, but they're certainly reduced.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and prosecute people for minor offenses. It's costly to involve the court system, appoint public defenders, and pay judges and prosecutors. This can be a heavy burden for municipalities that are already struggling financially. Some communities might be philosophically opposed to decriminalization, even if it would free up funds for other essential services like public education, social programs for seniors, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, in cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization is seen as a positive step. It's freed up resources that can be redirected to more pressing issues. The financial aspect is just one factor; there are other reasons to approach this issue carefully. If marijuana were fully legalized, it could become as ubiquitous as cigarettes, and that's a concern for many people. Some worry about people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many circles.\n\nWhile marijuana might have a different impact on people's lives compared to alcohol, both substances have their negative effects. It's challenging to generalize how individuals react to substances, as people's responses vary greatly. Some can handle it moderately, while others might struggle. Nonetheless, I believe both substances have their drawbacks, and it's essential to approach this issue with caution.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with you because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition. They've maintained certain rituals and practices for a long time, which can be beneficial in providing a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally important to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel obligated to attend church every week and adhere to strict rules regarding their practices. Unfortunately, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church looks down on people who don't conform to their doctrine, and it can be exclusionary towards those who aren't perfect Catholics or those of other faiths. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's ironic that the Catholic faith teaches love and acceptance, but their practices often contradict this. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily solve the issue of pedophilia, though. Those who engage in such behavior tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship, after all, and I'm not convinced that allowing priests to be married would significantly impact this problem.\n\nIn any case, I don't think it would be a solution to the issue at hand. People who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, so this aspect of the debate doesn't seem to be a crucial factor.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to form an opinion on this topic. To be frank, I'm not convinced that either side has the upper hand here. I think this is one of the most complex issues we're dealing with at the moment. On one hand, we have the delicate balance between church and state, and on the other, the definition of marriage is a minefield.\n\nTo be honest, I'm undecided on whether marriage should be viewed through a government lens. After all, many people consider it a sacrament, and that's not something the government should meddle with. If two people get married, they should be treated as any other couple, regardless of whether they've been baptized or not. They should be seen as a civil union, plain and simple.\n\nMy point is that we shouldn't be separating church and state on this issue. It's not about whether the marriage was, say, a Christian or secular one; it's about two people coming together. And if we're talking about gay marriage, it's really just about two people entering into a civil union.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it should be pushed to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous. It's a huge issue for some people, but it's not something that warrants amending the constitution.\n\nIt's not a big enough deal to warrant altering the constitution, let alone defining or banning gay marriage. Period.\n\nFrankly, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has made homosexuality a bit of a complex issue for me. I have close gay friends, and while I have my reservations about their lifestyle choices, I believe it's essential to support their rights. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be legalized. However, I don't think it should be a federal issue; rather, it should be left up to individual states to decide.\n\nI understand that many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, and as a result, their views on gay marriage may differ. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, I don't think you should necessarily disagree with the decision, considering you chose to reside there. I believe everyone should be entitled to the same opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered this point, but I don't believe it's right for President Bush to impose his views on the entire country, dictating that gay marriage should be banned nationwide. I think it's up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I disagree with his stance on the matter.\n\nTo be frank, I think it's unfair for the President to decide how every state should govern itself. He doesn't live in every state, so how can he possibly understand the unique needs and values of each community? Some issues should be left to the states to decide, and the President's ban on gay marriage is one of them. Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and his successor could potentially reverse his decision. It's just common sense to let individual states handle this issue, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences of their decisions.\n\nI don't think so.",
            "I guess I'm a bit hesitant to post this, but I wanted to share my thoughts on a rather delicate topic. Essentially, when you post something online, like on a public platform like Myspace, you have to accept that it's out there for anyone to see - not just school officials, but pretty much anyone with an internet connection. \n\nAs I see it, school officials have every right to see what students are posting online, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school. With the internet, it's not like they'd need to be under the school's name to access it; they could easily check it from home. Given the importance of school safety, I think it's perfectly fine for officials to monitor students' online activity if it helps prevent potential threats, such as a school shooting. \n\nIn fact, if school officials are going on Myspace just to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, I think that's a bit too invasive. However, if their goal is to maintain a safer school environment, I don't see that as an issue. It's a trade-off between personal freedom and school responsibility, and in this case, I think the school's responsibility to keep students safe takes precedence.\n\nOne of the main issues is that anything you post online is essentially permanent, and it can come back to haunt you. Even if you're not doing anything malicious, there's always a risk that someone will stumble upon something you posted, and it could lead to trouble. That's why I'm cautious about posting anything potentially sensitive, even in private emails. \n\nIt's a bit paradoxical, but if you do something questionable in college, it can come back to haunt you later in life. Once something's online, it's out there forever, and there's no taking it back. So, in my opinion, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nIn this particular case, I think the school officials were justified in monitoring students' Myspace activity to prevent potential threats. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safer school environment. I've had this conversation with a teacher before, and they mentioned that schools have to be proactive in ensuring student safety, like conducting lockdown drills to prepare for emergencies. It's not that far-fetched to think that monitoring online activity could be part of that.\n\nUltimately, I think it's a delicate balance between personal freedom and school responsibility. If school officials have a legitimate reason to monitor online activity, like preventing school shootings, then I don't see that as an invasion of privacy. It's all about prioritizing student safety.",
            "Honestly, I haven't been able to articulate my thoughts on the war lately because I've been trying to process the initial emotions that led to our involvement. At first, I was all for going over there, especially since September 11th affected me personally. I thought we should take a strong stance and show them the same kind of chaos they inflicted upon us. However, as I looked deeper, I realized we weren't prepared for the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into it without a clear plan, and that's when things started to unravel.\n\nI now find myself strongly opposed to the war. I don't think it's achieved anything significant, and I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on making progress. As long as they're at odds with themselves, it's hard to see how our presence would make a difference. Unfortunately, the trauma of September 11th has left me with a sense of detachment towards the situation. I struggle to care about the conflicts over there, and it's hard for me to see them as human beings when they're so consumed by violence.\n\nThe biggest issue is that war is a foreign concept to them, and their approach is far more brutal than ours. I don't think they're seeking to improve their country; instead, they're focused on getting rid of us. I think it's time for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were driven by a desire for revenge and a lack of rational thinking about the potential consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq seemed like a knee-jerk reaction, and I'm not convinced it was the right call.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we should have had a clearer plan and a more united front. Without that, we've only created more chaos. I don't think we're equipped to change the people of Iraq; they'll continue to be the way they are, and our presence only serves to prolong the conflicts. I genuinely believe we're not making enough progress, and no matter how long we stay, it'll eventually collapse once we leave. I think our presence is self-damaging, and it's time for us to reassess our strategy."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to reassess its stance on several issues. Many people have been discussing the decline in the Church's following, and I believe it's because the Church is often not very accepting of various things.\n\nFor instance, their views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control are quite rigid, which is understandable, but also somewhat outdated. If the Church were to be more open to modern perspectives, it wouldn't lose its followers. Instead, people are starting to turn against the Church's stance on these issues and view them as outdated.\n\nSome individuals are even choosing not to follow the Church because of its views on topics like abortion and gay marriage. The Church's stance against abortion means that those who support it might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. Similarly, those who believe in and want to practice gay marriage might not feel at home in a community that doesn't support it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented the Church's problems entirely. Perhaps allowing priests to be married or having female priests might have changed things, but it's hard to say for certain.\n\nThe idea that priests can't be married because they're \"married to God\" doesn't sit well with me. Everyone else in the world has a job and a personal life, so why can't priests have both? It's a bit illogical to expect them to dedicate their entire lives to the Church without any personal relationships.",
            "I haven't really been able to articulate my thoughts on the issue of gay marriage, but I wanted to take a moment to share my perspective. To be clear, I don't have any issue with gay marriage in general. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose, but rather something they're born with. So, I don't think it's fair to hold them accountable for it. It seems to me that it's not a matter of personal choice, but rather a fundamental aspect of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, I do believe it's unjust to deny gay couples the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation. It's not like they've made a conscious decision to be gay; they're just being themselves. I think it's essential to recognize and respect that.\n\nIn my view, the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral concerns. It's simply a personal matter that doesn't affect anyone else. I think it's unfair for the government to interfere in people's private lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as their relationships and identities. Let's face it, people are born gay, and they shouldn't be punished for being themselves.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "i think that gay marriage should be legalized. here's why: there's just no good reason not to. people often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's really not the same thing. it's like comparing apples and oranges - two different sides of the same coin. you can't have heads without tails, and the same goes for these relationships. they're just as valid, with their own set of civil rights, like property taxes and healthcare benefits. for example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital because they're not considered family, which is pretty silly considering you're planning to spend the rest of your life together. research has shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as straight couples do.\n\nthe issue is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church - they're asking for a legal marriage certificate from the government. this should be a no-brainer, especially if you consider it's a civil union, not a religious one. it's like segregation - separate but equal. they're asking for the same rights and recognition as straight couples.\n\npeople worry about things like adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. they're concerned about how gay couples will be perceived by society, and whether or not their children will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. but this is a new issue, and it's hard to say for sure. the main concern is how children of gay parents will be treated by their peers and other adults. in places like new york city, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied and harassed in public schools. this is just cruel.\n\nresearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of parenting as straight couples. it's really just a matter of personal choice, not sexual orientation. the federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. the amendment against it is just a form of hypocrisy, considering the controversy over the pledge of allegiance and government enforcing religious standards on the country.\n\nsome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is just not true. the american psychological association has debunked this claim, and people should be listening to research and studies, not just popular opinion and their neighbors' views. if we listened to experts, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I'm still working at the hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I had some thoughts on this topic. Just because a particular substance is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have potential benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the general public, no way, not at all. However, if we can use it for medicinal purposes, then I think that's a different story.\n\nThe thing is, some medications that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are still used in pharmacies because they're beneficial, despite their illegitimate status. If we dismiss marijuana's benefits just because there's a stigma surrounding it, that's just pointless. I think we should give its potential benefits some consideration.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is comparable to alcohol, though. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, whereas excessive alcohol consumption can have even worse consequences. Integrating marijuana into society in a controlled manner might be a viable option, but it would require some adjustments. We need to address the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople tend to have a negative perception of marijuana because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as hazardous as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might use it more responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone some significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's a lot less strict than it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was a routine I followed, even when I was at private school, where I'd see my friends on weekends. But things have changed, and the church has introduced a more laid-back atmosphere. They've even created a \"teenager mass\" that's only 30 minutes long, which has made things more casual. People now show up in their beach clothes during the summer, and even families who are running late are welcome. The morning masses, where I used to dress up, are now more relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. It's definitely a more casual vibe.\n\nTo be honest, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I'm not too familiar with the church's inner workings, but that's my observation. \n\nRegarding the recent accusations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and it's their personal choice to act on their attraction to young kids. It's not about their marital status; it's about the individual's character. I also believe that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nSome religions allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh-Day Adventists, and their reverends or ministers are still expected to adhere to their faith. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different denomination. \n\nTo elaborate, I think the key factor in pedophilia is genetics, rather than upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some factors might contribute, I believe people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed through marriage or any other means. The church, in this case, couldn't have done much to prevent these incidents, especially if they were not aware of the situations. If they were aware and chose to cover it up, that's a different story.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have much to add.",
            "I have to say, I initially found the idea [insert premise] somewhat acceptable, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and it seemed like we went into Iraq under the guise of a pretext. I believe the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really ruffled my feathers, and the Iraq war has become a contentious issue for me. It seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave a key presentation at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is a serious breach of trust and raises questions about accountability.\n\nIt's become clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the Constitution and has been working to undermine it since at least 9/11. I believe they came into office with the intention of going to war, and their actions suggest that they were motivated by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein. The younger Bush may have had a personal score to settle with Saddam, possibly due to his father's administration, and may have been hoping to expand our energy supplies.\n\nI think it's time for the war to end, but I'm concerned that withdrawal would lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative appears to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order. However, I'm skeptical about this approach, as it may create more problems in the long run, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to exert control, with radical elements vying for power.\n\nI'm not sure I have a solution that I can articulate in polite company, but I'm certainly vocal about my skepticism regarding the war and its aftermath.",
            "I haven't posted in a while, so I wanted to weigh in on the War in Iraq. To be honest, I'm not sure how to articulate my views because I don't really follow the intricacies of the conflict. From what I've gathered, it seems like we're still there more or less out of a desire to establish a democratic government, similar to our own, and to secure access to their oil reserves. However, this endeavor has been met with widespread discontent. The problem is, if we stay, we risk facing a prolonged and difficult process of nation-building, only to potentially leave behind a power vacuum that could lead to further conflict. On the other hand, if we withdraw, the people of Iraq will likely be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, which could also lead to resentment towards the US. At this point, I'm struggling to see a clear-cut solution.\n\nTo be blunt, I think it's time to reevaluate our involvement in the conflict. Let's be honest, the US didn't declare a formal war, so it's hard to justify the ongoing occupation. And even if we did, I'm not convinced that our presence is doing more good than harm. The resources we're expending could be better spent elsewhere, and the situation is causing President Bush a lot of grief. I'm reminded of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared conflict that's now widely regarded as a meaningless war. If history repeats itself, Bush risks being remembered as the president who initiated a similarly fruitless conflict.\n\nIt's also worth considering the human cost. There are families I know who have loved ones serving in Iraq, and it's hard to reconcile the desire to support them with the knowledge that our continued presence is causing them harm. However, I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be attempting to impose our own values and way of life on the Iraqi people, which could lead to even more resentment and division. The Al-Qaeda threat is also a concern, as our presence may only serve to fuel their hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight. That's my take on the situation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not thrilled about this, but it doesn't feel right for a state to make it legal. In my opinion, it's more the churches' decision, given the constitution's separation of church and state clause. It's quite clear in there, and I think trying to impose power over it would be a direct defiance of what's been established. \n\nThose pushing for it to be made illegal seem to be choosing one church's beliefs over another, especially considering most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't dictate as law.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even proposing an amendment on this seems wrong, as it goes against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why they're pushing for this amendment, other than it aligns with the president's own Catholic beliefs. This just shows a preference for one religion over others, which isn't right. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There's no real reason behind the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've made my point clear, so I'll stop there.",
            "Well, let's get to the point - I'm still trying to wrap my head around the war in Iraq. I think the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. It seemed like they tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but that was a bit of a stretch. Emotions were high after 9/11, and the government played on that to justify the war. \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of war, especially pre-emptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from those experiences. The number of American soldiers who have died is staggering, and it's heartbreaking. Removing a country's government without being prepared for the aftermath can lead to chaos and power vacuums, which is exactly what happened in Iraq.\n\nThe US government was trying to implant a democratic government, but that's a long and difficult process. It's not something that can be achieved overnight, and it's not as simple as pushing out one government and replacing it with another. The US should have known that the road to democracy in Iraq would be long and hard, but they seemed to downplay that. \n\nI think the government was not adequately prepared for the insurgency that arose, and that's a major reason why we're still in Iraq today. It's not a clear-cut victory like they initially thought it would be. Fighting an insurgency is tough, especially when you're fighting the very citizens of the country. It's a difficult situation, and I think the government underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nIf the government was going to go to war, they should have planned for all possible outcomes. They didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there. Many American troops have died, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to secure their own country. It's a long and difficult process, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be easy.\n\nThe reason we're in Iraq is a complex one, but I think it's largely about oil and controlling resources. The initial reason for the invasion was to find weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had those types of weapons, haven't faced the same level of aggression. It's a bit hypocritical, and I think the US government isn't being honest about its motivations.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. Unfortunately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.",
            "Honestly, I think I'm pretty clear on where I stand when it comes to gay marriage. I've always been a supporter, and I believe it's a matter of personal preference. Research has shown that homosexuality may have a biological basis, rather than being solely a product of upbringing, so it's unfair to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI think it's inhumane to treat people differently based on their sexual orientation, especially when it's not something they can change. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government should stay out of it – it's a personal issue, not a political one. Even at the state level, marriage is often seen as a personal choice, not a matter for the government to dictate.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who lead regular lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks, go about their daily business, and don't deserve to be treated any differently. I find it ridiculous that the current administration is trying to impose its own interpretation of what marriage should be.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing. This is a biological factor, not a social one, and it's unfair to penalize people for something they can't control.\n\nOne of the main issues I have is that marriage is a private matter, but only straight couples seem to have that privilege. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly in a place like Las Vegas, but if a gay couple wants to make the same commitment, it's splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think that's a double standard that needs to be addressed.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a personal, private choice, rather than a matter of public debate and government intervention.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure where to start, but I'll try to clarify something here. When you post something online, it becomes a public forum, completely open to everyone's view. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this issue in the past. You see, once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, it's only a matter of time before someone takes notice. You can't control what people think or say when they see that content online, and it's not like you can retract it either.\n\nThe internet is a public space, visible to anyone, and if your friends have you connected on platforms like Myspace, they'll likely see whatever you post. It's not the school that's accessing that information, but rather someone who's brought it to their attention. Since they can't just ignore it, they have to take action to prevent any potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just a joke, but that's why it's essential to be mindful of what you post online.\n\nWhat happened at our school was a great example of this. Someone overheard something that sounded alarming, and when we investigated, we found out it was just a misinterpreted joke. However, in the heat of the moment, it became a serious concern. When you post something online, you're essentially waiving your right to privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to form an opinion about you, don't share your thoughts online.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friending their students on social media platforms or snooping around their online activities. That's just not right. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. We shouldn't be monitoring private conversations or texts, but if it's brought to our attention, we have to address it. A good rule of thumb is to avoid creating fake online accounts or friending students under different names – that's just not a good idea.\n\nAs an RA, I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially when they post about it online. I'd rather not have that level of connection with them. It's not my place to know, and it's not my responsibility to police their behavior. That's just not what I signed up for.",
            "i'm getting the feeling that this war has dragged on for far too long. \noriginally, the goal was commendable - to bring democracy to a country in need of it. \nbut it's clear we've strayed from that purpose a long time ago. \nnow, it seems like we're fighting just to prove a point, to show off our military might. \ni'm not so sure about the motivations behind this war from the start, especially considering george bush's senior's past issues with saddam hussein. \nif the goal was to introduce democracy to a country with a flawed political system, that would be a valid reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. \nin my opinion, it's been a drawn-out conflict \ni think we made our point in the first few months, simply by starting the war - it was a statement in itself. \nbut the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year, maybe even years, just seems like a waste of time. \nif we were genuinely trying to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. \nhowever, over time, our reasons for fighting seem to have been lost and misconstrued. \nit appears we're still at war, simply because we don't want to stop fighting. \ni think it's time to bring this to an end, for the sake of our own economy and resources. \nwe've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, while neglecting our own internal issues, like poverty and underfunding for essential services like education and healthcare. \ni believe we should be spending our money on domestic problems, rather than a war that's lost its purpose. \nultimately, it's time for the government of the country we're involved in to take responsibility for themselves, and for us to focus on our own problems at home.",
            "I was wondering if I could clarify something. It seems that someone was able to access information online that ended up preventing a potentially serious situation. \n\nTo be honest, if you're posting information on the internet, it's generally fair game for anyone to see. On platforms like Myspace, for instance, you have to grant access to your profile by adding someone as a friend. When you do that, you're essentially giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it's safe to say that if someone stumbles upon your online presence, you should be aware that many people will see what you've posted. It's just the way the internet works. In this particular case, I actually think it's good that someone was able to prevent a potential issue.\n\nHowever, it does raise some complex questions. On one hand, it's not feasible to have someone constantly monitoring every student's online activity to prevent problems. But on the other hand, if they're focusing on specific individuals, it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is, but it seems like it would depend on the specific circumstances. Was the person simply browsing randomly, or were they actively searching for something? If it's the latter, it's a bit more understandable.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook and I'm aware of the potential risks. There are people out there who can access a lot of information about me, and I've seen cases where people have been able to gather info quickly. It's a bit unnerving, to say the least.\n\nI do try to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. You never really know who might be viewing your online activity.\n\nI did hear a story about a high school that banned students from having Myspace accounts. To be honest, I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to make that decision. It's a bit of a gray area when it comes to online privacy.",
            "I'm not sure if I'm going to get into this, but I guess I have to mention the Iraq War one more time. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, but I'll try to get it out. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The fact is, pretty much everyone, including the administration, now agrees that the war was a bad idea - except they don't want to admit they made a mistake. It's clear from recent polls that the overwhelming majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis, U.S. troops, and even global citizens, think the war was a bad idea. In fact, a staggering 75 to 80 percent of people worldwide, 80 percent of Iraqis, and 70 percent of U.S. troops in Iraq believe we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's been a complete disaster from the very beginning, and now it seems like pulling out will also be a challenge. The Middle East is just too complex, with a huge cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states. It's simply unrealistic to think we can impose democracy in an area where it's not necessarily wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. I just don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq; the administration's ideas on why it's better to stay seem flawed, and I haven't seen a legitimate reason to stay longer.\n\nIf we want to leave gradually over the course of a year or more, I wouldn't have a huge problem with that. However, I just don't see why we can't leave now. A recent statistic I came across showed that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with at least a quarter wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and it's hard to ignore their wishes. If we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our decision if things go badly. If we decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as trying to do the right thing, even if we're not entirely successful.",
            "I wanted to share my thoughts on the issue of gender discrimination in the United States. To be honest, I think it's still a big problem. Not just for women, but also in certain fields of work. The thing is, even though we're supposed to be equal, many people still struggle to find opportunities to work under a woman, simply because of how society has been conditioned over the years. \n\nIn the workplace, women often have the skills and qualifications for a particular job, but they might not get promoted because of the way things have always been done. It's not just about women, though; men can face similar issues in industries like fashion or when taking time off to care for their families. People tend to look down on men who choose to stay at home and raise their kids, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be tough on them, especially if they've always wanted to be involved in their children's lives.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where men can face discrimination. If a man is passionate about fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume it's a female-dominated field. This is partly because men who are into fashion are often seen as not being like other guys. It's hard to understand how they can truly relate to women's fashion when they have a different style of life.\n\nIn my opinion, gender discrimination is a problem in various fields, and it's not easy to change. Society has a set mindset that's hard to shift, but we're making progress. We've seen women breaking into leadership roles and becoming CEOs, and it's slowly becoming more accepted. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted, as people realize that women's careers can be just as valuable.\n\nTo promote change, I think we need to highlight the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be pushy or forceful, but rather showcase their strengths in a way that resonates with people. If we try to change too quickly, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now, where we're starting to make progress without pushing too hard. It's all about finding that balance and letting things unfold naturally.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, education, or even their grammar, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might face prejudice because of their regional accent or lack of formal education, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Similarly, men can be discriminated against by other men based on their background or education level.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that gender discrimination is a complex issue that affects people in different ways, and it's not just about women. We need to recognize this and work together to create a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "Well, I think people misunderstand the concept. They're not advocating for full legalization, but rather decriminalization. This essentially changes the penalty from a serious crime to a minor infraction, much like a traffic ticket. You'd get a citation rather than being arrested and taken in. This is a significant difference, especially for those who worry about future consequences, such as job interviews and the like. These repercussions might not entirely disappear with decriminalization, but they're certainly reduced.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and prosecute people for minor offenses. It's costly to involve the court system, appoint public defenders, and pay judges and prosecutors. This can be a heavy burden for municipalities that are already struggling financially. Some communities might be philosophically opposed to decriminalization, even if it would free up funds for other essential services like public education, social programs for seniors, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, in cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization is seen as a positive step. It's freed up resources that can be redirected to more pressing issues. The financial aspect is just one factor; there are other reasons to approach this issue carefully. If marijuana were fully legalized, it could become as ubiquitous as cigarettes, and that's a concern for many people. Some worry about people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many circles.\n\nWhile marijuana might have a different impact on people's lives compared to alcohol, both substances have their negative effects. It's challenging to generalize how individuals react to substances, as people's responses vary greatly. Some can handle it moderately, while others might struggle. Nonetheless, I believe both substances have their drawbacks, and it's essential to approach this issue with caution.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with you because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition. They've maintained certain rituals and practices for a long time, which can be beneficial in providing a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally important to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel obligated to attend church every week and adhere to strict rules regarding their practices. Unfortunately, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church looks down on people who don't conform to their doctrine, and it can be exclusionary towards those who aren't perfect Catholics or those of other faiths. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's ironic that the Catholic faith teaches love and acceptance, but their practices often contradict this. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily solve the issue of pedophilia, though. Those who engage in such behavior tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship, after all, and I'm not convinced that allowing priests to be married would significantly impact this problem.\n\nIn any case, I don't think it would be a solution to the issue at hand. People who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, so this aspect of the debate doesn't seem to be a crucial factor.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to form an opinion on this topic. To be frank, I'm not convinced that either side has the upper hand here. I think this is one of the most complex issues we're dealing with at the moment. On one hand, we have the delicate balance between church and state, and on the other, the definition of marriage is a minefield.\n\nTo be honest, I'm undecided on whether marriage should be viewed through a government lens. After all, many people consider it a sacrament, and that's not something the government should meddle with. If two people get married, they should be treated as any other couple, regardless of whether they've been baptized or not. They should be seen as a civil union, plain and simple.\n\nMy point is that we shouldn't be separating church and state on this issue. It's not about whether the marriage was, say, a Christian or secular one; it's about two people coming together. And if we're talking about gay marriage, it's really just about two people entering into a civil union.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it should be pushed to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous. It's a huge issue for some people, but it's not something that warrants amending the constitution.\n\nIt's not a big enough deal to warrant altering the constitution, let alone defining or banning gay marriage. Period.\n\nFrankly, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has made homosexuality a bit of a complex issue for me. I have close gay friends, and while I have my reservations about their lifestyle choices, I believe it's essential to support their rights. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be legalized. However, I don't think it should be a federal issue; rather, it should be left up to individual states to decide.\n\nI understand that many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, and as a result, their views on gay marriage may differ. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, I don't think you should necessarily disagree with the decision, considering you chose to reside there. I believe everyone should be entitled to the same opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered this point, but I don't believe it's right for President Bush to impose his views on the entire country, dictating that gay marriage should be banned nationwide. I think it's up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I disagree with his stance on the matter.\n\nTo be frank, I think it's unfair for the President to decide how every state should govern itself. He doesn't live in every state, so how can he possibly understand the unique needs and values of each community? Some issues should be left to the states to decide, and the President's ban on gay marriage is one of them. Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and his successor could potentially reverse his decision. It's just common sense to let individual states handle this issue, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences of their decisions.\n\nI don't think so.",
            "I guess I'm a bit hesitant to post this, but I wanted to share my thoughts on a rather delicate topic. Essentially, when you post something online, like on a public platform like Myspace, you have to accept that it's out there for anyone to see - not just school officials, but pretty much anyone with an internet connection. \n\nAs I see it, school officials have every right to see what students are posting online, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school. With the internet, it's not like they'd need to be under the school's name to access it; they could easily check it from home. Given the importance of school safety, I think it's perfectly fine for officials to monitor students' online activity if it helps prevent potential threats, such as a school shooting. \n\nIn fact, if school officials are going on Myspace just to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, I think that's a bit too invasive. However, if their goal is to maintain a safer school environment, I don't see that as an issue. It's a trade-off between personal freedom and school responsibility, and in this case, I think the school's responsibility to keep students safe takes precedence.\n\nOne of the main issues is that anything you post online is essentially permanent, and it can come back to haunt you. Even if you're not doing anything malicious, there's always a risk that someone will stumble upon something you posted, and it could lead to trouble. That's why I'm cautious about posting anything potentially sensitive, even in private emails. \n\nIt's a bit paradoxical, but if you do something questionable in college, it can come back to haunt you later in life. Once something's online, it's out there forever, and there's no taking it back. So, in my opinion, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nIn this particular case, I think the school officials were justified in monitoring students' Myspace activity to prevent potential threats. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safer school environment. I've had this conversation with a teacher before, and they mentioned that schools have to be proactive in ensuring student safety, like conducting lockdown drills to prepare for emergencies. It's not that far-fetched to think that monitoring online activity could be part of that.\n\nUltimately, I think it's a delicate balance between personal freedom and school responsibility. If school officials have a legitimate reason to monitor online activity, like preventing school shootings, then I don't see that as an invasion of privacy. It's all about prioritizing student safety.",
            "Honestly, I haven't been able to articulate my thoughts on the war lately because I've been trying to process the initial emotions that led to our involvement. At first, I was all for going over there, especially since September 11th affected me personally. I thought we should take a strong stance and show them the same kind of chaos they inflicted upon us. However, as I looked deeper, I realized we weren't prepared for the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into it without a clear plan, and that's when things started to unravel.\n\nI now find myself strongly opposed to the war. I don't think it's achieved anything significant, and I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on making progress. As long as they're at odds with themselves, it's hard to see how our presence would make a difference. Unfortunately, the trauma of September 11th has left me with a sense of detachment towards the situation. I struggle to care about the conflicts over there, and it's hard for me to see them as human beings when they're so consumed by violence.\n\nThe biggest issue is that war is a foreign concept to them, and their approach is far more brutal than ours. I don't think they're seeking to improve their country; instead, they're focused on getting rid of us. I think it's time for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were driven by a desire for revenge and a lack of rational thinking about the potential consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq seemed like a knee-jerk reaction, and I'm not convinced it was the right call.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we should have had a clearer plan and a more united front. Without that, we've only created more chaos. I don't think we're equipped to change the people of Iraq; they'll continue to be the way they are, and our presence only serves to prolong the conflicts. I genuinely believe we're not making enough progress, and no matter how long we stay, it'll eventually collapse once we leave. I think our presence is self-damaging, and it's time for us to reassess our strategy."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to reassess its stance on several issues. Many people have been discussing the decline in the Church's following, and I believe it's because the Church is often not very accepting of various things.\n\nFor instance, their views on gay marriages, abortion, and birth control are quite rigid, which is understandable, but also somewhat outdated. If the Church were to be more open to modern perspectives, it wouldn't lose its followers. Instead, people are starting to turn against the Church's stance on these issues and view them as outdated.\n\nSome individuals are even choosing not to follow the Church because of its views on topics like abortion and gay marriage. The Church's stance against abortion means that those who support it might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that teaches it's wrong. Similarly, those who believe in and want to practice gay marriage might not feel at home in a community that doesn't support it.\n\nI don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. However, I'm not sure if this would have prevented the Church's problems entirely. Perhaps allowing priests to be married or having female priests might have changed things, but it's hard to say for certain.\n\nThe idea that priests can't be married because they're \"married to God\" doesn't sit well with me. Everyone else in the world has a job and a personal life, so why can't priests have both? It's a bit illogical to expect them to dedicate their entire lives to the Church without any personal relationships.",
            "I haven't really been able to articulate my thoughts on the issue of gay marriage, but I wanted to take a moment to share my perspective. To be clear, I don't have any issue with gay marriage in general. In my opinion, people's sexual orientation isn't something they choose, but rather something they're born with. So, I don't think it's fair to hold them accountable for it. It seems to me that it's not a matter of personal choice, but rather a fundamental aspect of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't given the topic a lot of thought, I do believe it's unjust to deny gay couples the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation. It's not like they've made a conscious decision to be gay; they're just being themselves. I think it's essential to recognize and respect that.\n\nIn my view, the federal government shouldn't be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or moral concerns. It's simply a personal matter that doesn't affect anyone else. I think it's unfair for the government to interfere in people's private lives, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as their relationships and identities. Let's face it, people are born gay, and they shouldn't be punished for being themselves.\n\nThat's my take on the matter.",
            "i think that gay marriage should be legalized. here's why: there's just no good reason not to. people often think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's really not the same thing. it's like comparing apples and oranges - two different sides of the same coin. you can't have heads without tails, and the same goes for these relationships. they're just as valid, with their own set of civil rights, like property taxes and healthcare benefits. for example, if you're in a gay couple, your partner might not be allowed to visit you in the hospital because they're not considered family, which is pretty silly considering you're planning to spend the rest of your life together. research has shown that gay couples have the same rates of success and satisfaction in their relationships as straight couples do.\n\nthe issue is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church - they're asking for a legal marriage certificate from the government. this should be a no-brainer, especially if you consider it's a civil union, not a religious one. it's like segregation - separate but equal. they're asking for the same rights and recognition as straight couples.\n\npeople worry about things like adoption and community issues, but these are just excuses. they're concerned about how gay couples will be perceived by society, and whether or not their children will be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation. but this is a new issue, and it's hard to say for sure. the main concern is how children of gay parents will be treated by their peers and other adults. in places like new york city, they have special schools for kids of gay parents because they get bullied and harassed in public schools. this is just cruel.\n\nresearch has shown that gay couples are just as capable of parenting as straight couples. it's really just a matter of personal choice, not sexual orientation. the federal government should be involved in this issue and make gay marriage legal in every state. the amendment against it is just a form of hypocrisy, considering the controversy over the pledge of allegiance and government enforcing religious standards on the country.\n\nsome people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged or flawed, but this is just not true. the american psychological association has debunked this claim, and people should be listening to research and studies, not just popular opinion and their neighbors' views. if we listened to experts, we might see the world in a different light.",
            "Honestly, I'm still working at the hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I had some thoughts on this topic. Just because a particular substance is outlawed doesn't mean it doesn't have potential benefits. I'm not saying we should make it available to the general public, no way, not at all. However, if we can use it for medicinal purposes, then I think that's a different story.\n\nThe thing is, some medications that are controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are still used in pharmacies because they're beneficial, despite their illegitimate status. If we dismiss marijuana's benefits just because there's a stigma surrounding it, that's just pointless. I think we should give its potential benefits some consideration.\n\nIt's not like marijuana is comparable to alcohol, though. If you abuse marijuana, it can lead to problems, whereas excessive alcohol consumption can have even worse consequences. Integrating marijuana into society in a controlled manner might be a viable option, but it would require some adjustments. We need to address the stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then people might use it more responsibly.\n\nPeople tend to have a negative perception of marijuana because it's an illegal substance, but it's not as hazardous as heroin or cocaine. If we can change that perception, people might use it more responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has undergone some significant changes to adapt to the 21st century. It's a lot less strict than it used to be. When I was younger, I would always attend church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was a routine I followed, even when I was at private school, where I'd see my friends on weekends. But things have changed, and the church has introduced a more laid-back atmosphere. They've even created a \"teenager mass\" that's only 30 minutes long, which has made things more casual. People now show up in their beach clothes during the summer, and even families who are running late are welcome. The morning masses, where I used to dress up, are now more relaxed, with people wearing jeans and khakis. It's definitely a more casual vibe.\n\nTo be honest, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I'm not too familiar with the church's inner workings, but that's my observation. \n\nRegarding the recent accusations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and it's their personal choice to act on their attraction to young kids. It's not about their marital status; it's about the individual's character. I also believe that when someone chooses to become a priest, it's their decision, and they should be aware of their own desires and limitations.\n\nSome religions allow their clergy to get married, like Seventh-Day Adventists, and their reverends or ministers are still expected to adhere to their faith. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they could consider a different denomination. \n\nTo elaborate, I think the key factor in pedophilia is genetics, rather than upbringing or environment. While it's possible that some factors might contribute, I believe people are born with these tendencies. It's not something that can be changed through marriage or any other means. The church, in this case, couldn't have done much to prevent these incidents, especially if they were not aware of the situations. If they were aware and chose to cover it up, that's a different story.\n\nAs for other thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have much to add.",
            "I have to say, I initially found the idea [insert premise] somewhat acceptable, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and it seemed like we went into Iraq under the guise of a pretext. I believe the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, which has since been proven false.\n\nThis really ruffled my feathers, and the Iraq war has become a contentious issue for me. It seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for those lies. Even Colin Powell, who gave a key presentation at the UN, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this is a serious breach of trust and raises questions about accountability.\n\nIt's become clear that the Bush administration has a disregard for the Constitution and has been working to undermine it since at least 9/11. I believe they came into office with the intention of going to war, and their actions suggest that they were motivated by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein. The younger Bush may have had a personal score to settle with Saddam, possibly due to his father's administration, and may have been hoping to expand our energy supplies.\n\nI think it's time for the war to end, but I'm concerned that withdrawal would lead to chaos and more bloodshed. The alternative appears to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order. However, I'm skeptical about this approach, as it may create more problems in the long run, particularly regarding Iraq's sovereignty. The interim government seems ineffective, and the Parliament is struggling to exert control, with radical elements vying for power.\n\nI'm not sure I have a solution that I can articulate in polite company, but I'm certainly vocal about my skepticism regarding the war and its aftermath.",
            "I haven't posted in a while, so I wanted to weigh in on the War in Iraq. To be honest, I'm not sure how to articulate my views because I don't really follow the intricacies of the conflict. From what I've gathered, it seems like we're still there more or less out of a desire to establish a democratic government, similar to our own, and to secure access to their oil reserves. However, this endeavor has been met with widespread discontent. The problem is, if we stay, we risk facing a prolonged and difficult process of nation-building, only to potentially leave behind a power vacuum that could lead to further conflict. On the other hand, if we withdraw, the people of Iraq will likely be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, which could also lead to resentment towards the US. At this point, I'm struggling to see a clear-cut solution.\n\nTo be blunt, I think it's time to reevaluate our involvement in the conflict. Let's be honest, the US didn't declare a formal war, so it's hard to justify the ongoing occupation. And even if we did, I'm not convinced that our presence is doing more good than harm. The resources we're expending could be better spent elsewhere, and the situation is causing President Bush a lot of grief. I'm reminded of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared conflict that's now widely regarded as a meaningless war. If history repeats itself, Bush risks being remembered as the president who initiated a similarly fruitless conflict.\n\nIt's also worth considering the human cost. There are families I know who have loved ones serving in Iraq, and it's hard to reconcile the desire to support them with the knowledge that our continued presence is causing them harm. However, I'm worried that if we stay, we'll be attempting to impose our own values and way of life on the Iraqi people, which could lead to even more resentment and division. The Al-Qaeda threat is also a concern, as our presence may only serve to fuel their hatred towards the US.\n\nIn the end, I think this conflict will drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight. That's my take on the situation.",
            "Honestly, I'm not thrilled about this, but it doesn't feel right for a state to make it legal. In my opinion, it's more the churches' decision, given the constitution's separation of church and state clause. It's quite clear in there, and I think trying to impose power over it would be a direct defiance of what's been established. \n\nThose pushing for it to be made illegal seem to be choosing one church's beliefs over another, especially considering most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's place to decide what churches can and can't dictate as law.\n\nSeparation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for religious tolerance in the United States. Even proposing an amendment on this seems wrong, as it goes against what's already been stated. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think any government should be involved in this issue. I'm not sure why they're pushing for this amendment, other than it aligns with the president's own Catholic beliefs. This just shows a preference for one religion over others, which isn't right. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or government. There's no real reason behind the amendment other than personal views, and I don't see how it would have any significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it might even have a positive effect on society.\n\nI think I've made my point clear, so I'll stop there.",
            "Well, let's get to the point - I'm still trying to wrap my head around the war in Iraq. I think the government was less than honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war before invading Iraq. It seemed like they tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but that was a bit of a stretch. Emotions were high after 9/11, and the government played on that to justify the war. \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of war, especially pre-emptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is a repeat of the mistakes made during the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from those experiences. The number of American soldiers who have died is staggering, and it's heartbreaking. Removing a country's government without being prepared for the aftermath can lead to chaos and power vacuums, which is exactly what happened in Iraq.\n\nThe US government was trying to implant a democratic government, but that's a long and difficult process. It's not something that can be achieved overnight, and it's not as simple as pushing out one government and replacing it with another. The US should have known that the road to democracy in Iraq would be long and hard, but they seemed to downplay that. \n\nI think the government was not adequately prepared for the insurgency that arose, and that's a major reason why we're still in Iraq today. It's not a clear-cut victory like they initially thought it would be. Fighting an insurgency is tough, especially when you're fighting the very citizens of the country. It's a difficult situation, and I think the government underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nIf the government was going to go to war, they should have planned for all possible outcomes. They didn't seem to be prepared for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, and now we're still there. Many American troops have died, and we're still trying to train the Iraqi military and police forces to secure their own country. It's a long and difficult process, and I think the US government was naive to think it would be easy.\n\nThe reason we're in Iraq is a complex one, but I think it's largely about oil and controlling resources. The initial reason for the invasion was to find weapons of mass destruction, but they were never found. Meanwhile, countries like North Korea, which we knew had those types of weapons, haven't faced the same level of aggression. It's a bit hypocritical, and I think the US government isn't being honest about its motivations.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there's peace in Iraq. Unfortunately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.",
            "Honestly, I think I'm pretty clear on where I stand when it comes to gay marriage. I've always been a supporter, and I believe it's a matter of personal preference. Research has shown that homosexuality may have a biological basis, rather than being solely a product of upbringing, so it's unfair to deny people rights based on something they can't control.\n\nI think it's inhumane to treat people differently based on their sexual orientation, especially when it's not something they can change. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government should stay out of it – it's a personal issue, not a political one. Even at the state level, marriage is often seen as a personal choice, not a matter for the government to dictate.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who lead regular lives, just like any other family. They take their dogs for walks, go about their daily business, and don't deserve to be treated any differently. I find it ridiculous that the current administration is trying to impose its own interpretation of what marriage should be.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard, there's evidence to suggest that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than being a result of upbringing. This is a biological factor, not a social one, and it's unfair to penalize people for something they can't control.\n\nOne of the main issues I have is that marriage is a private matter, but only straight couples seem to have that privilege. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do it discreetly in a place like Las Vegas, but if a gay couple wants to make the same commitment, it's splashed across the front pages of newspapers like the New York Times. I think that's a double standard that needs to be addressed.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a personal, private choice, rather than a matter of public debate and government intervention.",
            "Honestly, I'm not sure where to start, but I'll try to clarify something here. When you post something online, it becomes a public forum, completely open to everyone's view. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this issue in the past. You see, once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions about you. If you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings, it's only a matter of time before someone takes notice. You can't control what people think or say when they see that content online, and it's not like you can retract it either.\n\nThe internet is a public space, visible to anyone, and if your friends have you connected on platforms like Myspace, they'll likely see whatever you post. It's not the school that's accessing that information, but rather someone who's brought it to their attention. Since they can't just ignore it, they have to take action to prevent any potential harm. Of course, it's hard to know what's serious and what's just a joke, but that's why it's essential to be mindful of what you post online.\n\nWhat happened at our school was a great example of this. Someone overheard something that sounded alarming, and when we investigated, we found out it was just a misinterpreted joke. However, in the heat of the moment, it became a serious concern. When you post something online, you're essentially waiving your right to privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to form an opinion about you, don't share your thoughts online.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friending their students on social media platforms or snooping around their online activities. That's just not right. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously and act accordingly. We shouldn't be monitoring private conversations or texts, but if it's brought to our attention, we have to address it. A good rule of thumb is to avoid creating fake online accounts or friending students under different names – that's just not a good idea.\n\nAs an RA, I don't want to know about my residents' personal lives, especially when they post about it online. I'd rather not have that level of connection with them. It's not my place to know, and it's not my responsibility to police their behavior. That's just not what I signed up for.",
            "i'm getting the feeling that this war has dragged on for far too long. \noriginally, the goal was commendable - to bring democracy to a country in need of it. \nbut it's clear we've strayed from that purpose a long time ago. \nnow, it seems like we're fighting just to prove a point, to show off our military might. \ni'm not so sure about the motivations behind this war from the start, especially considering george bush's senior's past issues with saddam hussein. \nif the goal was to introduce democracy to a country with a flawed political system, that would be a valid reason - as long as personal interests weren't involved. \nin my opinion, it's been a drawn-out conflict \ni think we made our point in the first few months, simply by starting the war - it was a statement in itself. \nbut the fact that it's been ongoing for over a year, maybe even years, just seems like a waste of time. \nif we were genuinely trying to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. \nhowever, over time, our reasons for fighting seem to have been lost and misconstrued. \nit appears we're still at war, simply because we don't want to stop fighting. \ni think it's time to bring this to an end, for the sake of our own economy and resources. \nwe've been pouring billions of dollars into this conflict, while neglecting our own internal issues, like poverty and underfunding for essential services like education and healthcare. \ni believe we should be spending our money on domestic problems, rather than a war that's lost its purpose. \nultimately, it's time for the government of the country we're involved in to take responsibility for themselves, and for us to focus on our own problems at home.",
            "I was wondering if I could clarify something. It seems that someone was able to access information online that ended up preventing a potentially serious situation. \n\nTo be honest, if you're posting information on the internet, it's generally fair game for anyone to see. On platforms like Myspace, for instance, you have to grant access to your profile by adding someone as a friend. When you do that, you're essentially giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it's safe to say that if someone stumbles upon your online presence, you should be aware that many people will see what you've posted. It's just the way the internet works. In this particular case, I actually think it's good that someone was able to prevent a potential issue.\n\nHowever, it does raise some complex questions. On one hand, it's not feasible to have someone constantly monitoring every student's online activity to prevent problems. But on the other hand, if they're focusing on specific individuals, it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI'm not sure what the right approach is, but it seems like it would depend on the specific circumstances. Was the person simply browsing randomly, or were they actively searching for something? If it's the latter, it's a bit more understandable.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook and I'm aware of the potential risks. There are people out there who can access a lot of information about me, and I've seen cases where people have been able to gather info quickly. It's a bit unnerving, to say the least.\n\nI do try to limit what I share online, but at the same time, I want to be able to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. You never really know who might be viewing your online activity.\n\nI did hear a story about a high school that banned students from having Myspace accounts. To be honest, I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to make that decision. It's a bit of a gray area when it comes to online privacy.",
            "I'm not sure if I'm going to get into this, but I guess I have to mention the Iraq War one more time. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it, but I'll try to get it out. I mean, I was against it from the start, but it's not really relevant anymore. The fact is, pretty much everyone, including the administration, now agrees that the war was a bad idea - except they don't want to admit they made a mistake. It's clear from recent polls that the overwhelming majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis, U.S. troops, and even global citizens, think the war was a bad idea. In fact, a staggering 75 to 80 percent of people worldwide, 80 percent of Iraqis, and 70 percent of U.S. troops in Iraq believe we should pull out within the year.\n\nIt's been a complete disaster from the very beginning, and now it seems like pulling out will also be a challenge. The Middle East is just too complex, with a huge cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern states. It's simply unrealistic to think we can impose democracy in an area where it's not necessarily wanted. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's likely to become a disaster, like quicksand. I just don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq; the administration's ideas on why it's better to stay seem flawed, and I haven't seen a legitimate reason to stay longer.\n\nIf we want to leave gradually over the course of a year or more, I wouldn't have a huge problem with that. However, I just don't see why we can't leave now. A recent statistic I came across showed that 80 percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within a year, with at least a quarter wanting us to leave immediately. These are the people we're trying to help, and it's hard to ignore their wishes. If we ask them if we should leave, and they say yes, then it's not our decision if things go badly. If we decide to help out after that, at least we'll be seen as trying to do the right thing, even if we're not entirely successful.",
            "I wanted to share my thoughts on the issue of gender discrimination in the United States. To be honest, I think it's still a big problem. Not just for women, but also in certain fields of work. The thing is, even though we're supposed to be equal, many people still struggle to find opportunities to work under a woman, simply because of how society has been conditioned over the years. \n\nIn the workplace, women often have the skills and qualifications for a particular job, but they might not get promoted because of the way things have always been done. It's not just about women, though; men can face similar issues in industries like fashion or when taking time off to care for their families. People tend to look down on men who choose to stay at home and raise their kids, expecting them to be the breadwinners instead. This can be tough on them, especially if they've always wanted to be involved in their children's lives.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where men can face discrimination. If a man is passionate about fashion, people might not take him seriously because they assume it's a female-dominated field. This is partly because men who are into fashion are often seen as not being like other guys. It's hard to understand how they can truly relate to women's fashion when they have a different style of life.\n\nIn my opinion, gender discrimination is a problem in various fields, and it's not easy to change. Society has a set mindset that's hard to shift, but we're making progress. We've seen women breaking into leadership roles and becoming CEOs, and it's slowly becoming more accepted. Men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are also becoming more accepted, as people realize that women's careers can be just as valuable.\n\nTo promote change, I think we need to highlight the qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped. We shouldn't be pushy or forceful, but rather showcase their strengths in a way that resonates with people. If we try to change too quickly, people will resist. I think we're at a good point now, where we're starting to make progress without pushing too hard. It's all about finding that balance and letting things unfold naturally.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people can be discriminated against based on their background, education, or even their grammar, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area might face prejudice because of their regional accent or lack of formal education, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Similarly, men can be discriminated against by other men based on their background or education level.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that gender discrimination is a complex issue that affects people in different ways, and it's not just about women. We need to recognize this and work together to create a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "Well, I think people misunderstand the concept. They're not advocating for full legalization, but rather decriminalization. This essentially changes the penalty from a serious crime to a minor infraction, much like a traffic ticket. You'd get a citation rather than being arrested and taken in. This is a significant difference, especially for those who worry about future consequences, such as job interviews and the like. These repercussions might not entirely disappear with decriminalization, but they're certainly reduced.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization is that it's expensive to arrest, book, and prosecute people for minor offenses. It's costly to involve the court system, appoint public defenders, and pay judges and prosecutors. This can be a heavy burden for municipalities that are already struggling financially. Some communities might be philosophically opposed to decriminalization, even if it would free up funds for other essential services like public education, social programs for seniors, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, in cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization is seen as a positive step. It's freed up resources that can be redirected to more pressing issues. The financial aspect is just one factor; there are other reasons to approach this issue carefully. If marijuana were fully legalized, it could become as ubiquitous as cigarettes, and that's a concern for many people. Some worry about people smoking and driving, which is already a taboo in many circles.\n\nWhile marijuana might have a different impact on people's lives compared to alcohol, both substances have their negative effects. It's challenging to generalize how individuals react to substances, as people's responses vary greatly. Some can handle it moderately, while others might struggle. Nonetheless, I believe both substances have their drawbacks, and it's essential to approach this issue with caution.",
            "Honestly, I'd agree with you because many of their customs and practices are deeply rooted in tradition. They've maintained certain rituals and practices for a long time, which can be beneficial in providing a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally important to be open to change and adapt to new ideas. \n\nA lot of Catholics feel obligated to attend church every week and adhere to strict rules regarding their practices. Unfortunately, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church looks down on people who don't conform to their doctrine, and it can be exclusionary towards those who aren't perfect Catholics or those of other faiths. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic, respectively, weren't allowed to get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's Episcopalian faith.\n\nIt's ironic that the Catholic faith teaches love and acceptance, but their practices often contradict this. Allowing priests to marry might not necessarily solve the issue of pedophilia, though. Those who engage in such behavior tend to do so regardless of their marital status. It's a different kind of relationship, after all, and I'm not convinced that allowing priests to be married would significantly impact this problem.\n\nIn any case, I don't think it would be a solution to the issue at hand. People who harm children are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, so this aspect of the debate doesn't seem to be a crucial factor.",
            "Honestly, I'm still trying to form an opinion on this topic. To be frank, I'm not convinced that either side has the upper hand here. I think this is one of the most complex issues we're dealing with at the moment. On one hand, we have the delicate balance between church and state, and on the other, the definition of marriage is a minefield.\n\nTo be honest, I'm undecided on whether marriage should be viewed through a government lens. After all, many people consider it a sacrament, and that's not something the government should meddle with. If two people get married, they should be treated as any other couple, regardless of whether they've been baptized or not. They should be seen as a civil union, plain and simple.\n\nMy point is that we shouldn't be separating church and state on this issue. It's not about whether the marriage was, say, a Christian or secular one; it's about two people coming together. And if we're talking about gay marriage, it's really just about two people entering into a civil union.\n\nIf all the states can come to a logical agreement, then it should be pushed to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? That's just ridiculous. It's a huge issue for some people, but it's not something that warrants amending the constitution.\n\nIt's not a big enough deal to warrant altering the constitution, let alone defining or banning gay marriage. Period.\n\nFrankly, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has made homosexuality a bit of a complex issue for me. I have close gay friends, and while I have my reservations about their lifestyle choices, I believe it's essential to support their rights. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be legalized. However, I don't think it should be a federal issue; rather, it should be left up to individual states to decide.\n\nI understand that many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, and as a result, their views on gay marriage may differ. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, I don't think you should necessarily disagree with the decision, considering you chose to reside there. I believe everyone should be entitled to the same opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nTo be honest, I've already covered this point, but I don't believe it's right for President Bush to impose his views on the entire country, dictating that gay marriage should be banned nationwide. I think it's up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I disagree with his stance on the matter.\n\nTo be frank, I think it's unfair for the President to decide how every state should govern itself. He doesn't live in every state, so how can he possibly understand the unique needs and values of each community? Some issues should be left to the states to decide, and the President's ban on gay marriage is one of them. Plus, he's only in office for a limited time, and his successor could potentially reverse his decision. It's just common sense to let individual states handle this issue, as they're the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences of their decisions.\n\nI don't think so.",
            "I guess I'm a bit hesitant to post this, but I wanted to share my thoughts on a rather delicate topic. Essentially, when you post something online, like on a public platform like Myspace, you have to accept that it's out there for anyone to see - not just school officials, but pretty much anyone with an internet connection. \n\nAs I see it, school officials have every right to see what students are posting online, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school. With the internet, it's not like they'd need to be under the school's name to access it; they could easily check it from home. Given the importance of school safety, I think it's perfectly fine for officials to monitor students' online activity if it helps prevent potential threats, such as a school shooting. \n\nIn fact, if school officials are going on Myspace just to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, I think that's a bit too invasive. However, if their goal is to maintain a safer school environment, I don't see that as an issue. It's a trade-off between personal freedom and school responsibility, and in this case, I think the school's responsibility to keep students safe takes precedence.\n\nOne of the main issues is that anything you post online is essentially permanent, and it can come back to haunt you. Even if you're not doing anything malicious, there's always a risk that someone will stumble upon something you posted, and it could lead to trouble. That's why I'm cautious about posting anything potentially sensitive, even in private emails. \n\nIt's a bit paradoxical, but if you do something questionable in college, it can come back to haunt you later in life. Once something's online, it's out there forever, and there's no taking it back. So, in my opinion, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nIn this particular case, I think the school officials were justified in monitoring students' Myspace activity to prevent potential threats. It's not an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safer school environment. I've had this conversation with a teacher before, and they mentioned that schools have to be proactive in ensuring student safety, like conducting lockdown drills to prepare for emergencies. It's not that far-fetched to think that monitoring online activity could be part of that.\n\nUltimately, I think it's a delicate balance between personal freedom and school responsibility. If school officials have a legitimate reason to monitor online activity, like preventing school shootings, then I don't see that as an invasion of privacy. It's all about prioritizing student safety.",
            "Honestly, I haven't been able to articulate my thoughts on the war lately because I've been trying to process the initial emotions that led to our involvement. At first, I was all for going over there, especially since September 11th affected me personally. I thought we should take a strong stance and show them the same kind of chaos they inflicted upon us. However, as I looked deeper, I realized we weren't prepared for the long-term consequences of our actions. We rushed into it without a clear plan, and that's when things started to unravel.\n\nI now find myself strongly opposed to the war. I don't think it's achieved anything significant, and I believe the people over there are more focused on fighting each other than on making progress. As long as they're at odds with themselves, it's hard to see how our presence would make a difference. Unfortunately, the trauma of September 11th has left me with a sense of detachment towards the situation. I struggle to care about the conflicts over there, and it's hard for me to see them as human beings when they're so consumed by violence.\n\nThe biggest issue is that war is a foreign concept to them, and their approach is far more brutal than ours. I don't think they're seeking to improve their country; instead, they're focused on getting rid of us. I think it's time for us to leave and let them handle their own affairs. We were driven by a desire for revenge and a lack of rational thinking about the potential consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq seemed like a knee-jerk reaction, and I'm not convinced it was the right call.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we should have had a clearer plan and a more united front. Without that, we've only created more chaos. I don't think we're equipped to change the people of Iraq; they'll continue to be the way they are, and our presence only serves to prolong the conflicts. I genuinely believe we're not making enough progress, and no matter how long we stay, it'll eventually collapse once we leave. I think our presence is self-damaging, and it's time for us to reassess our strategy."
