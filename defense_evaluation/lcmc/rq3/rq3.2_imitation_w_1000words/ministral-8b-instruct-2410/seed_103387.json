            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to stay relevant in today's society. They argue that the Church's strong stance on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control might be turning people away. The Church's rigid views on these topics are seen as outdated by some, and they suggest that adopting a more modern perspective could help retain its following. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which could be a contributing factor to its dwindling membership. For instance, those who support abortion or gay marriage might feel uncomfortable in a community that condemns these practices. While some suggest that allowing female priests or married priests could help, it's uncertain if this would have prevented past incidents. The question remains: why can't priests, who are devoted to God, also have a family life?",
            "I’m not opposed to gay marriage, you know? I think it’s not something that people choose, consciously or otherwise. Whether you're born that way or not, it’s not a decision, and I think gay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but not two people of the same sex. I haven’t given this topic a lot of thought, but I would definitely say it’s wrong for them to say that.\n\nIt’s not like a choice, you know? People aren’t choosing to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. It doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable for something they can’t control. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this because it’s more about personal freedom than anything else. It’s not like a legal issue or a moral concern; it’s just who they are. I don’t think they should be punished for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people worry that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but the reality is that it's a different situation with many nuanced aspects that don't align with these fears. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin, where heads and tails can't be the same, but essentially it's the same thing. There are civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner in a same-sex relationship can't be considered next of kin and can't be present during a hospital visit. I think it's silly to deny this right to those who would otherwise spend the rest of their life with someone. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship factors as heterosexual couples. They are just in a different kind of relationship, but one that's still valid and meaningful. Same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a government-issued marriage certificate. If there's no involvement from the church or state in the marriage process, then the issue shouldn't cause concern. Allowing civil unions should be a step towards allowing marriage. It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as heterosexual couples in relationships and communities. People worry about adoption and how children of same-sex couples will be raised and accepted by society. However, many studies suggest that children of same-sex couples are just as well-adjusted as children from heterosexual families. There's no indication that their sexual orientation choices will negatively impact their lives. I think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. I believe the amendment should be the opposite and allow same-sex couples the right to marry. However, President Bush has strong views on this topic, influenced by his religious beliefs, which he also shares with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments for opposing gay marriage are based on morality, which varies greatly among individuals and groups. It's unfair to base laws on the morality of one group while ignoring others. It's hypocritical to have laws that enforce religious standards on the entire country, considering the controversy around the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against same-sex marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked this claim. If people would listen to institutions that conduct research and studies instead of popular opinion, they might see the world differently.",
            "Well, I'm working at a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, the fact that a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. For instance, drugs like oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances, but they're beneficial when used under medical supervision. So, while I'm not in favor of making all illegal drugs like marijuana available to the public, I do believe they should be studied and considered for medicinal purposes. After all, just because something is taboo doesn't mean it's not useful.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as people often make it out to be. While both can be harmful if abused, marijuana isn't as dangerous as substances like heroin or cocaine. That's why I think integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could work. First, we need to remove the negative stigma surrounding it. Once people see marijuana as less of a taboo, they might use it responsibly, and it can certainly have beneficial medical applications.",
            "The church, in my view, has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less rigid than in years past. Back when I was younger and attended private school, we would all don matching outfits each Sunday, complete with cute dresses, shoes, and purses. However, as I've grown older, the church has undergone significant changes. For instance, there's now a teenager mass that's been shortened to 30 minutes, and casual attire has become the norm, with families often arriving late or even in beachwear during the summer. Moreover, I've noticed that even morning masses have become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of formal attire. In my opinion, these changes are a response to the evolving times and have made the church more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I believe these issues are deeply rooted in the individual's genetic makeup and cannot be prevented by simply allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Some married men still have attractions towards children, and their behavior isn't influenced by the church's policies regarding marriage. Furthermore, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone truly wants to practice their faith and also marry, they might consider exploring other religious paths. I don't think the church could have prevented these incidents, as they are often tied to the individual's genetics and not the church's policies. However, if they were aware of the situation and chose to cover it up, they should be held accountable. Nevertheless, I don't think in all cases the church was aware of the problems.",
            "Oh, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still grappling with the aftermath of September 11. The Iraq war seemed like a pretext, with the Bush administration linking it to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since proven false, and it's still a sore point for me. The Iraq war really gets my goat.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people openly and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has disregarded the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they entered office with a plan to go to war, driven by a sense of vengeance for their dad's administration and a desire to expand our energy supply.\n\nI think it's gone on too long, and pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be ideal either. It could cause more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a major issue. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament not very effective and factions vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate politely.",

            "I don't think it's right for any state to declare it legal, or for the government to enforce any power over it. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to do otherwise would be in defiance of that principle. It seems like those advocating for its illegality are imposing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I believe the government shouldn't interfere in this matter; it's a religious issue that should be decided by the churches, not the president or any other government official. The push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader social or economic impact. In fact, I think it could even have a positive effect on society. I've said all that needs to be said on the matter.",
            "War in Iraq\nWell, let me start from the beginning. I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about why we went to war in Iraq. Before the invasion in 2003, there was an attempt to link the conflict to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, there wasn't a significant connection between the two. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks, to justify the invasion.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is a repetition of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nThe US tried to install a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they did in Vietnam. However, they underestimated the challenge. It's a long, hard process to establish democracy, and it's not something that can be achieved quickly or without significant casualties. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes, but they didn't. We're still there today, and there are still American troops dying.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one. In the 2004 presidential election, I was considering voting for George Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping for so long. We took away their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? However, we must also consider the high number of American casualties and whether it's worth continuing to risk lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe principal reason for invading Iraq was to make it a democratic nation. But why Iraq, and not other countries? The primary reason is oil. It's about controlling resources, and Iraq is a significant supplier. Before the invasion, there were claims of weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Meanwhile, we know North Korea has weapons of mass destruction, yet we're not attacking them. I don't think the government is being thorough or truthful enough in its decisions.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it may not happen.",
            "I've always been a strong advocate for gay marriage because it's a deeply personal preference that's increasingly recognized as being more biological than sociological. It's unfair to deny rights to individuals based on factors beyond their control. I find it inhumane to restrict others' choices based on their sexual orientation. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples who live their lives much like any other family. They walk their dogs, take care of their homes, and are an integral part of the community. President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his own interpretations are misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a private matter, not something that should be dictated by politics or the government. I believe that the biological predisposition towards homosexuality is something that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so with minimal fanfare, but if a same-sex couple does the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I think marriage should remain a private, personal issue rather than a public one.",

            "Some wars just drag on indefinitely. This one, in particular, has been going on far too long, originally intended to restore democracy in another country. From the outset, the purpose seemed noble, but it soon became evident that we had lost sight of that goal. Now, it appears that we are merely perpetuating the conflict to assert our global dominance. Perhaps the initial motivations were influenced by George Bush Sr.'s past disputes with Saddam Hussein, but if the original aim was to bestow democracy upon a nation lacking a fair political system, that would have been justified. However, over time, our rationale seems to have become unclear and misguided, as if we're just prolonging the war to avoid a decisive end.\n\nYou know, if our intention was to topple a tyrannical regime and bring democracy to a country, that would be a just cause. But the war has dragged on for years, and the initial goal seems to have been forgotten. We've been at war for our own sake, wanting a grand victory, and we've been pouring billions into this conflict, money that could have been used to address our own economic and social issues, like poverty or healthcare.\n\nIt's like we're pouring our resources into a war that no longer serves a valid purpose, while our own citizens suffer from lack of funding for essential services. We've been at this for too long. It's time to let the local government take over and focus our resources on our own turf. War is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are pressing issues at home that we need to address, like public infrastructure and healthcare. It's time to bring our soldiers home and let the other country deal with its own affairs.",
            "Can I clarify something? I mean, it seemed like the issue was avoided because someone went online and, well, found that there was... something there. Right?\n\nUm, I don't think that's the issue. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much open to the public. You need to understand that anyone can see what you share, especially if you're friends with someone. You're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nThat being said, I understand that it's tricky. You can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles, right? But then again, if there's a genuine concern about someone's safety or behavior, isn't it somewhat reasonable to do so?\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I have Facebook. It bothers me to know that creepy people out there can see personal information about me. I saw a show once where a guy hacked a girl's profile and found out her screen name and location in less than a minute. It's scary, and I don't want to meet people based on that kind of information. Sometimes my classmates IM me knowing it's me, even if I don't recognize their screen names. It's like they know my interests, where I am, and who my friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also use it to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but it's hard to control who can see what you share.\n\nMy roommate told me that in her high school, students were banned from having a Myspace. That seemed a bit off to me. I wasn't sure how school officials could have the power to tell students they couldn't have a Myspace. It's not a privacy issue, more of a power issue. They don't really have the right to tell people what they can and can't do online.",
            "Hmm, well, there's one more thing I need to discuss, the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it. I guess I'm going to join the crowd that says they were against it from the start. I was, but it's not as important now. The general consensus was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit they were wrong.\n\nRecent polls, both in the U.S., Iraq, and globally, show that about 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops there think it was a dumb idea and want us to leave within a year. It's been a complete disaster since we arrived.\n\nI don't know, it's just this culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle East. It's too big a gap for administrations to understand. They think they can impose democracy in an area that won't accept it. Saddam was bad, but the pros and cons should be weighed before invading. It's like quicksand; we're stuck in a mess.\n\nI don't know what to say about it. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to stay. If they want to leave gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't mind. But why not just leave now?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a quarter want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, we won't be responsible if things go wrong afterwards.",
            "While the United States has made strides in gender equality, I believe it's still an issue that's not fully resolved, particularly in specific work environments. For instance, many women face glass ceiling barriers in their professions, struggling to secure promotions due to historical gender biases. Meanwhile, men who stay at home to take care of children often face societal judgment and skepticism about their capabilities. In fields like fashion, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to preconceived notions about their interests and life choices. These instances of gender discrimination are not limited to gender but also extend to other aspects such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing, which can affect how one is perceived in a professional setting. Efforts to address these issues are ongoing, with women climbing higher ranks and men increasingly embracing stay-at-home roles, though societal acceptance is a gradual process. Ultimately, promoting understanding and acceptance through positive representations of these groups is key, without being too forceful, as societal change takes time.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. This downgraded it from a serious criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. For instance, if someone gets caught with it, they might face ramifications similar to those of a drug charge, potentially affecting job interviews and other aspects of life. While decriminalization doesn’t erase all future ramifications, it does reduce the cost of enforcement. Arresting, booking, and housing offenders, as well as court proceedings and appointing public defenders, place a significant financial burden on municipalities. Financially strained communities may thus hesitate to decriminalize, even if it could save them money. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards marijuana are more open, decriminalization is generally accepted. It frees up resources for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Still, marijuana isn’t something to be freely available everywhere. While legalizing it could make it as accessible as cigarettes, it might lead to widespread public smoking and driving under the influence. Additionally, many people still view marijuana use as taboo. Moreover, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana can have broader impacts on lifestyle. Both substances have their unique adverse effects, and individual reactions vary greatly. Some people can handle substances with moderation while others may not.",
            "I'd respond with a cautious \"yes,\" as I see the value in their traditional practices while also recognizing the need for adaptability to change. Many of their customs are deeply rooted, having been maintained for a long time. This adherence to tradition is a strength, but it's also crucial to embrace change where necessary. For instance, some Catholics are quite rigid about attending church weekly and maintaining strict adherence to their teachings. This can sometimes appear judgmental towards those who don't strictly follow the doctrine or belong to other religions. For example, my parents faced challenges when they tried to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's Episcopalian faith. This isn't reflective of the spirit of loving others, which is a core Catholic teaching, but rather a contradiction of it. I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine encourages certain actions, yet their practices often contradict these teachings, especially when they refuse to update outdated methods. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior, as child molestation is not the same as a marital relationship. I think these issues would persist regardless of marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, so I can't say whether one side is right or wrong. But I do believe it's the most complex issue we're facing today, due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure how to reconcile these things, but I think civil unions should be the default for all marriages, as they are essentially the same thing: two people united. If states can come to a logical conclusion on this, they should push for federal recognition, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. It's not important enough to amend the constitution over.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don’t agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue; each state should decide for itself. Many states are Democratic and many are Republican. Obviously, Democratic states will push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you know how the state feels about it. I don’t think you should disagree with the decision if a state legalizes it, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on each state's discretion. Well, I've already touched on that. But, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it should be up to the individual states to decide. I don’t agree with his ban on it. I don’t think Bush lives in every state, so he shouldn’t decide how each state wants to run itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Um, no, I don't agree at all. Um, let me see here. I think that Myspace is a public platform, and that means if you post something, it's meant for the public to see. Whether it be school officials or anyone else. I mean, if they see something on there that could potentially lead to a school shooting, or any other serious issue, they have every right to see it. It's not an invasion of privacy because it's publicly accessible. However, if they're just snooping around to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's for the safety and security of the students, I think that's perfectly fine. Like, if they're looking to make the school a safer place, then I don't see a problem with that. I mean, it's not like they're doing it just to catch students. They're doing it to ensure the safety of everyone. Yeah, that's about it",
            "Initially, I was fully supportive of going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much chaos as they did here. However, I now believe we overlooked long-term consequences and rushed in unprepared. The war backfired, and I'm now strongly opposed to it. The people there, consumed by their own conflicts, can't engage with us meaningfully. They're more focused on driving us out than improving their country. War is different for them; it's more savage, and I don't think they're interested in bettering their situation. We were mostly driven by anger and a desire for revenge, with President Bush leading the charge due to public sentiment. While declaring war on Iraq was necessary, we lacked a clear plan. There was no unity, and our goals were unclear. I don't think we're the ones to change them; they'll always be that way. I believe our involvement is causing more harm than good. The progress we've made is insufficient to justify our prolonged presence. It's a losing battle that we can't maintain forever. We're just hurting ourselves by staying."

studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to stay relevant in today's society. They argue that the Church's strong stance on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control might be turning people away. The Church's rigid views on these topics are seen as outdated by some, and they suggest that adopting a more modern perspective could help retain its following. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which could be a contributing factor to its dwindling membership. For instance, those who support abortion or gay marriage might feel uncomfortable in a community that condemns these practices. While some suggest that allowing female priests or married priests could help, it's uncertain if this would have prevented past incidents. The question remains: why can't priests, who are devoted to God, also have a family life?",
            "I’m not opposed to gay marriage, you know? I think it’s not something that people choose, consciously or otherwise. Whether you're born that way or not, it’s not a decision, and I think gay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but not two people of the same sex. I haven’t given this topic a lot of thought, but I would definitely say it’s wrong for them to say that.\n\nIt’s not like a choice, you know? People aren’t choosing to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. It doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable for something they can’t control. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this because it’s more about personal freedom than anything else. It’s not like a legal issue or a moral concern; it’s just who they are. I don’t think they should be punished for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people worry that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but the reality is that it's a different situation with many nuanced aspects that don't align with these fears. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin, where heads and tails can't be the same, but essentially it's the same thing. There are civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner in a same-sex relationship can't be considered next of kin and can't be present during a hospital visit. I think it's silly to deny this right to those who would otherwise spend the rest of their life with someone. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship factors as heterosexual couples. They are just in a different kind of relationship, but one that's still valid and meaningful. Same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a government-issued marriage certificate. If there's no involvement from the church or state in the marriage process, then the issue shouldn't cause concern. Allowing civil unions should be a step towards allowing marriage. It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as heterosexual couples in relationships and communities. People worry about adoption and how children of same-sex couples will be raised and accepted by society. However, many studies suggest that children of same-sex couples are just as well-adjusted as children from heterosexual families. There's no indication that their sexual orientation choices will negatively impact their lives. I think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. I believe the amendment should be the opposite and allow same-sex couples the right to marry. However, President Bush has strong views on this topic, influenced by his religious beliefs, which he also shares with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments for opposing gay marriage are based on morality, which varies greatly among individuals and groups. It's unfair to base laws on the morality of one group while ignoring others. It's hypocritical to have laws that enforce religious standards on the entire country, considering the controversy around the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against same-sex marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked this claim. If people would listen to institutions that conduct research and studies instead of popular opinion, they might see the world differently.",
            "Well, I'm working at a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, the fact that a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. For instance, drugs like oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances, but they're beneficial when used under medical supervision. So, while I'm not in favor of making all illegal drugs like marijuana available to the public, I do believe they should be studied and considered for medicinal purposes. After all, just because something is taboo doesn't mean it's not useful.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as people often make it out to be. While both can be harmful if abused, marijuana isn't as dangerous as substances like heroin or cocaine. That's why I think integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could work. First, we need to remove the negative stigma surrounding it. Once people see marijuana as less of a taboo, they might use it responsibly, and it can certainly have beneficial medical applications.",
            "The church, in my view, has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less rigid than in years past. Back when I was younger and attended private school, we would all don matching outfits each Sunday, complete with cute dresses, shoes, and purses. However, as I've grown older, the church has undergone significant changes. For instance, there's now a teenager mass that's been shortened to 30 minutes, and casual attire has become the norm, with families often arriving late or even in beachwear during the summer. Moreover, I've noticed that even morning masses have become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of formal attire. In my opinion, these changes are a response to the evolving times and have made the church more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I believe these issues are deeply rooted in the individual's genetic makeup and cannot be prevented by simply allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Some married men still have attractions towards children, and their behavior isn't influenced by the church's policies regarding marriage. Furthermore, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone truly wants to practice their faith and also marry, they might consider exploring other religious paths. I don't think the church could have prevented these incidents, as they are often tied to the individual's genetics and not the church's policies. However, if they were aware of the situation and chose to cover it up, they should be held accountable. Nevertheless, I don't think in all cases the church was aware of the problems.",
            "Oh, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still grappling with the aftermath of September 11. The Iraq war seemed like a pretext, with the Bush administration linking it to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since proven false, and it's still a sore point for me. The Iraq war really gets my goat.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people openly and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has disregarded the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they entered office with a plan to go to war, driven by a sense of vengeance for their dad's administration and a desire to expand our energy supply.\n\nI think it's gone on too long, and pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be ideal either. It could cause more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a major issue. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament not very effective and factions vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate politely.",

            "I don't think it's right for any state to declare it legal, or for the government to enforce any power over it. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to do otherwise would be in defiance of that principle. It seems like those advocating for its illegality are imposing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I believe the government shouldn't interfere in this matter; it's a religious issue that should be decided by the churches, not the president or any other government official. The push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader social or economic impact. In fact, I think it could even have a positive effect on society. I've said all that needs to be said on the matter.",
            "War in Iraq\nWell, let me start from the beginning. I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about why we went to war in Iraq. Before the invasion in 2003, there was an attempt to link the conflict to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, there wasn't a significant connection between the two. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks, to justify the invasion.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is a repetition of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nThe US tried to install a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they did in Vietnam. However, they underestimated the challenge. It's a long, hard process to establish democracy, and it's not something that can be achieved quickly or without significant casualties. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes, but they didn't. We're still there today, and there are still American troops dying.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one. In the 2004 presidential election, I was considering voting for George Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping for so long. We took away their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? However, we must also consider the high number of American casualties and whether it's worth continuing to risk lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe principal reason for invading Iraq was to make it a democratic nation. But why Iraq, and not other countries? The primary reason is oil. It's about controlling resources, and Iraq is a significant supplier. Before the invasion, there were claims of weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Meanwhile, we know North Korea has weapons of mass destruction, yet we're not attacking them. I don't think the government is being thorough or truthful enough in its decisions.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it may not happen.",
            "I've always been a strong advocate for gay marriage because it's a deeply personal preference that's increasingly recognized as being more biological than sociological. It's unfair to deny rights to individuals based on factors beyond their control. I find it inhumane to restrict others' choices based on their sexual orientation. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples who live their lives much like any other family. They walk their dogs, take care of their homes, and are an integral part of the community. President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his own interpretations are misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a private matter, not something that should be dictated by politics or the government. I believe that the biological predisposition towards homosexuality is something that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so with minimal fanfare, but if a same-sex couple does the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I think marriage should remain a private, personal issue rather than a public one.",

            "Some wars just drag on indefinitely. This one, in particular, has been going on far too long, originally intended to restore democracy in another country. From the outset, the purpose seemed noble, but it soon became evident that we had lost sight of that goal. Now, it appears that we are merely perpetuating the conflict to assert our global dominance. Perhaps the initial motivations were influenced by George Bush Sr.'s past disputes with Saddam Hussein, but if the original aim was to bestow democracy upon a nation lacking a fair political system, that would have been justified. However, over time, our rationale seems to have become unclear and misguided, as if we're just prolonging the war to avoid a decisive end.\n\nYou know, if our intention was to topple a tyrannical regime and bring democracy to a country, that would be a just cause. But the war has dragged on for years, and the initial goal seems to have been forgotten. We've been at war for our own sake, wanting a grand victory, and we've been pouring billions into this conflict, money that could have been used to address our own economic and social issues, like poverty or healthcare.\n\nIt's like we're pouring our resources into a war that no longer serves a valid purpose, while our own citizens suffer from lack of funding for essential services. We've been at this for too long. It's time to let the local government take over and focus our resources on our own turf. War is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are pressing issues at home that we need to address, like public infrastructure and healthcare. It's time to bring our soldiers home and let the other country deal with its own affairs.",
            "Can I clarify something? I mean, it seemed like the issue was avoided because someone went online and, well, found that there was... something there. Right?\n\nUm, I don't think that's the issue. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much open to the public. You need to understand that anyone can see what you share, especially if you're friends with someone. You're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nThat being said, I understand that it's tricky. You can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles, right? But then again, if there's a genuine concern about someone's safety or behavior, isn't it somewhat reasonable to do so?\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I have Facebook. It bothers me to know that creepy people out there can see personal information about me. I saw a show once where a guy hacked a girl's profile and found out her screen name and location in less than a minute. It's scary, and I don't want to meet people based on that kind of information. Sometimes my classmates IM me knowing it's me, even if I don't recognize their screen names. It's like they know my interests, where I am, and who my friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also use it to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but it's hard to control who can see what you share.\n\nMy roommate told me that in her high school, students were banned from having a Myspace. That seemed a bit off to me. I wasn't sure how school officials could have the power to tell students they couldn't have a Myspace. It's not a privacy issue, more of a power issue. They don't really have the right to tell people what they can and can't do online.",
            "Hmm, well, there's one more thing I need to discuss, the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it. I guess I'm going to join the crowd that says they were against it from the start. I was, but it's not as important now. The general consensus was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit they were wrong.\n\nRecent polls, both in the U.S., Iraq, and globally, show that about 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops there think it was a dumb idea and want us to leave within a year. It's been a complete disaster since we arrived.\n\nI don't know, it's just this culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle East. It's too big a gap for administrations to understand. They think they can impose democracy in an area that won't accept it. Saddam was bad, but the pros and cons should be weighed before invading. It's like quicksand; we're stuck in a mess.\n\nI don't know what to say about it. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to stay. If they want to leave gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't mind. But why not just leave now?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a quarter want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, we won't be responsible if things go wrong afterwards.",
            "While the United States has made strides in gender equality, I believe it's still an issue that's not fully resolved, particularly in specific work environments. For instance, many women face glass ceiling barriers in their professions, struggling to secure promotions due to historical gender biases. Meanwhile, men who stay at home to take care of children often face societal judgment and skepticism about their capabilities. In fields like fashion, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to preconceived notions about their interests and life choices. These instances of gender discrimination are not limited to gender but also extend to other aspects such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing, which can affect how one is perceived in a professional setting. Efforts to address these issues are ongoing, with women climbing higher ranks and men increasingly embracing stay-at-home roles, though societal acceptance is a gradual process. Ultimately, promoting understanding and acceptance through positive representations of these groups is key, without being too forceful, as societal change takes time.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. This downgraded it from a serious criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. For instance, if someone gets caught with it, they might face ramifications similar to those of a drug charge, potentially affecting job interviews and other aspects of life. While decriminalization doesn’t erase all future ramifications, it does reduce the cost of enforcement. Arresting, booking, and housing offenders, as well as court proceedings and appointing public defenders, place a significant financial burden on municipalities. Financially strained communities may thus hesitate to decriminalize, even if it could save them money. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards marijuana are more open, decriminalization is generally accepted. It frees up resources for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Still, marijuana isn’t something to be freely available everywhere. While legalizing it could make it as accessible as cigarettes, it might lead to widespread public smoking and driving under the influence. Additionally, many people still view marijuana use as taboo. Moreover, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana can have broader impacts on lifestyle. Both substances have their unique adverse effects, and individual reactions vary greatly. Some people can handle substances with moderation while others may not.",
            "I'd respond with a cautious \"yes,\" as I see the value in their traditional practices while also recognizing the need for adaptability to change. Many of their customs are deeply rooted, having been maintained for a long time. This adherence to tradition is a strength, but it's also crucial to embrace change where necessary. For instance, some Catholics are quite rigid about attending church weekly and maintaining strict adherence to their teachings. This can sometimes appear judgmental towards those who don't strictly follow the doctrine or belong to other religions. For example, my parents faced challenges when they tried to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's Episcopalian faith. This isn't reflective of the spirit of loving others, which is a core Catholic teaching, but rather a contradiction of it. I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine encourages certain actions, yet their practices often contradict these teachings, especially when they refuse to update outdated methods. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior, as child molestation is not the same as a marital relationship. I think these issues would persist regardless of marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, so I can't say whether one side is right or wrong. But I do believe it's the most complex issue we're facing today, due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure how to reconcile these things, but I think civil unions should be the default for all marriages, as they are essentially the same thing: two people united. If states can come to a logical conclusion on this, they should push for federal recognition, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. It's not important enough to amend the constitution over.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don’t agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue; each state should decide for itself. Many states are Democratic and many are Republican. Obviously, Democratic states will push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you know how the state feels about it. I don’t think you should disagree with the decision if a state legalizes it, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on each state's discretion. Well, I've already touched on that. But, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it should be up to the individual states to decide. I don’t agree with his ban on it. I don’t think Bush lives in every state, so he shouldn’t decide how each state wants to run itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Um, no, I don't agree at all. Um, let me see here. I think that Myspace is a public platform, and that means if you post something, it's meant for the public to see. Whether it be school officials or anyone else. I mean, if they see something on there that could potentially lead to a school shooting, or any other serious issue, they have every right to see it. It's not an invasion of privacy because it's publicly accessible. However, if they're just snooping around to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's for the safety and security of the students, I think that's perfectly fine. Like, if they're looking to make the school a safer place, then I don't see a problem with that. I mean, it's not like they're doing it just to catch students. They're doing it to ensure the safety of everyone. Yeah, that's about it",
            "Initially, I was fully supportive of going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much chaos as they did here. However, I now believe we overlooked long-term consequences and rushed in unprepared. The war backfired, and I'm now strongly opposed to it. The people there, consumed by their own conflicts, can't engage with us meaningfully. They're more focused on driving us out than improving their country. War is different for them; it's more savage, and I don't think they're interested in bettering their situation. We were mostly driven by anger and a desire for revenge, with President Bush leading the charge due to public sentiment. While declaring war on Iraq was necessary, we lacked a clear plan. There was no unity, and our goals were unclear. I don't think we're the ones to change them; they'll always be that way. I believe our involvement is causing more harm than good. The progress we've made is insufficient to justify our prolonged presence. It's a losing battle that we can't maintain forever. We're just hurting ourselves by staying."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Some people believe that the Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to stay relevant in today's society. They argue that the Church's strong stance on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control might be turning people away. The Church's rigid views on these topics are seen as outdated by some, and they suggest that adopting a more modern perspective could help retain its following. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which could be a contributing factor to its dwindling membership. For instance, those who support abortion or gay marriage might feel uncomfortable in a community that condemns these practices. While some suggest that allowing female priests or married priests could help, it's uncertain if this would have prevented past incidents. The question remains: why can't priests, who are devoted to God, also have a family life?",
            "I’m not opposed to gay marriage, you know? I think it’s not something that people choose, consciously or otherwise. Whether you're born that way or not, it’s not a decision, and I think gay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry but not two people of the same sex. I haven’t given this topic a lot of thought, but I would definitely say it’s wrong for them to say that.\n\nIt’s not like a choice, you know? People aren’t choosing to be gay any more than I chose to be straight. It doesn’t seem fair to hold them accountable for something they can’t control. I don’t think the federal government should be involved in this because it’s more about personal freedom than anything else. It’s not like a legal issue or a moral concern; it’s just who they are. I don’t think they should be punished for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. Frankly, there's no compelling reason not to. Many people worry that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but the reality is that it's a different situation with many nuanced aspects that don't align with these fears. It's like comparing two different sides of the same coin, where heads and tails can't be the same, but essentially it's the same thing. There are civil rights at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner in a same-sex relationship can't be considered next of kin and can't be present during a hospital visit. I think it's silly to deny this right to those who would otherwise spend the rest of their life with someone. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship factors as heterosexual couples. They are just in a different kind of relationship, but one that's still valid and meaningful. Same-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a government-issued marriage certificate. If there's no involvement from the church or state in the marriage process, then the issue shouldn't cause concern. Allowing civil unions should be a step towards allowing marriage. It's like segregation - separate but unequal. Same-sex couples play the same roles as heterosexual couples in relationships and communities. People worry about adoption and how children of same-sex couples will be raised and accepted by society. However, many studies suggest that children of same-sex couples are just as well-adjusted as children from heterosexual families. There's no indication that their sexual orientation choices will negatively impact their lives. I think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. I believe the amendment should be the opposite and allow same-sex couples the right to marry. However, President Bush has strong views on this topic, influenced by his religious beliefs, which he also shares with his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the arguments for opposing gay marriage are based on morality, which varies greatly among individuals and groups. It's unfair to base laws on the morality of one group while ignoring others. It's hypocritical to have laws that enforce religious standards on the entire country, considering the controversy around the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance. Many people are against same-sex marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked this claim. If people would listen to institutions that conduct research and studies instead of popular opinion, they might see the world differently.",
            "Well, I'm working at a hospital pharmacy this summer and let me tell you, the fact that a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. For instance, drugs like oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances, but they're beneficial when used under medical supervision. So, while I'm not in favor of making all illegal drugs like marijuana available to the public, I do believe they should be studied and considered for medicinal purposes. After all, just because something is taboo doesn't mean it's not useful.\n\nI don't think marijuana is as similar to alcohol as people often make it out to be. While both can be harmful if abused, marijuana isn't as dangerous as substances like heroin or cocaine. That's why I think integrating marijuana into society gradually, rather than all at once, could work. First, we need to remove the negative stigma surrounding it. Once people see marijuana as less of a taboo, they might use it responsibly, and it can certainly have beneficial medical applications.",
            "The church, in my view, has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less rigid than in years past. Back when I was younger and attended private school, we would all don matching outfits each Sunday, complete with cute dresses, shoes, and purses. However, as I've grown older, the church has undergone significant changes. For instance, there's now a teenager mass that's been shortened to 30 minutes, and casual attire has become the norm, with families often arriving late or even in beachwear during the summer. Moreover, I've noticed that even morning masses have become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis instead of formal attire. In my opinion, these changes are a response to the evolving times and have made the church more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I believe these issues are deeply rooted in the individual's genetic makeup and cannot be prevented by simply allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Some married men still have attractions towards children, and their behavior isn't influenced by the church's policies regarding marriage. Furthermore, becoming a priest is a personal choice, and if someone truly wants to practice their faith and also marry, they might consider exploring other religious paths. I don't think the church could have prevented these incidents, as they are often tied to the individual's genetics and not the church's policies. However, if they were aware of the situation and chose to cover it up, they should be held accountable. Nevertheless, I don't think in all cases the church was aware of the problems.",
            "Oh, I was initially okay with the idea, but I think everyone was still grappling with the aftermath of September 11. The Iraq war seemed like a pretext, with the Bush administration linking it to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. This has since proven false, and it's still a sore point for me. The Iraq war really gets my goat.\n\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people openly and hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration has disregarded the Constitution, trying to marginalize it since 9/11. I think they entered office with a plan to go to war, driven by a sense of vengeance for their dad's administration and a desire to expand our energy supply.\n\nI think it's gone on too long, and pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The alternative, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be ideal either. It could cause more problems in the long run, as Iraq's sovereignty could become a major issue. The interim government seems to be falling apart, with the Parliament not very effective and factions vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party.\n\nNone of this is something I can articulate politely.",

            "I don't think it's right for any state to declare it legal, or for the government to enforce any power over it. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and trying to do otherwise would be in defiance of that principle. It seems like those advocating for its illegality are imposing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I believe the government shouldn't interfere in this matter; it's a religious issue that should be decided by the churches, not the president or any other government official. The push for this amendment seems to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader social or economic impact. In fact, I think it could even have a positive effect on society. I've said all that needs to be said on the matter.",
            "War in Iraq\nWell, let me start from the beginning. I don't think the government was entirely honest with the American public about why we went to war in Iraq. Before the invasion in 2003, there was an attempt to link the conflict to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, but in reality, there wasn't a significant connection between the two. The government played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the 9/11 attacks, to justify the invasion.\n\nPersonally, I'm against war, especially when it's a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is a repetition of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, but they didn't. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not prepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed the removal of the Iraqi government.\n\nThe US tried to install a democratic government in Iraq, similar to what they did in Vietnam. However, they underestimated the challenge. It's a long, hard process to establish democracy, and it's not something that can be achieved quickly or without significant casualties. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes, but they didn't. We're still there today, and there are still American troops dying.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq was a difficult one. In the 2004 presidential election, I was considering voting for George Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, it's hard to abandon the people we've been helping for so long. We took away their government and way of life, so how can we abandon them now? However, we must also consider the high number of American casualties and whether it's worth continuing to risk lives for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nThe principal reason for invading Iraq was to make it a democratic nation. But why Iraq, and not other countries? The primary reason is oil. It's about controlling resources, and Iraq is a significant supplier. Before the invasion, there were claims of weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. Meanwhile, we know North Korea has weapons of mass destruction, yet we're not attacking them. I don't think the government is being thorough or truthful enough in its decisions.\n\nI just hope that the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but it may not happen.",
            "I've always been a strong advocate for gay marriage because it's a deeply personal preference that's increasingly recognized as being more biological than sociological. It's unfair to deny rights to individuals based on factors beyond their control. I find it inhumane to restrict others' choices based on their sexual orientation. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples who live their lives much like any other family. They walk their dogs, take care of their homes, and are an integral part of the community. President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his own interpretations are misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a private matter, not something that should be dictated by politics or the government. I believe that the biological predisposition towards homosexuality is something that can't be changed by upbringing or environment. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so with minimal fanfare, but if a same-sex couple does the same, it becomes a public spectacle. I think marriage should remain a private, personal issue rather than a public one.",

            "Some wars just drag on indefinitely. This one, in particular, has been going on far too long, originally intended to restore democracy in another country. From the outset, the purpose seemed noble, but it soon became evident that we had lost sight of that goal. Now, it appears that we are merely perpetuating the conflict to assert our global dominance. Perhaps the initial motivations were influenced by George Bush Sr.'s past disputes with Saddam Hussein, but if the original aim was to bestow democracy upon a nation lacking a fair political system, that would have been justified. However, over time, our rationale seems to have become unclear and misguided, as if we're just prolonging the war to avoid a decisive end.\n\nYou know, if our intention was to topple a tyrannical regime and bring democracy to a country, that would be a just cause. But the war has dragged on for years, and the initial goal seems to have been forgotten. We've been at war for our own sake, wanting a grand victory, and we've been pouring billions into this conflict, money that could have been used to address our own economic and social issues, like poverty or healthcare.\n\nIt's like we're pouring our resources into a war that no longer serves a valid purpose, while our own citizens suffer from lack of funding for essential services. We've been at this for too long. It's time to let the local government take over and focus our resources on our own turf. War is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are pressing issues at home that we need to address, like public infrastructure and healthcare. It's time to bring our soldiers home and let the other country deal with its own affairs.",
            "Can I clarify something? I mean, it seemed like the issue was avoided because someone went online and, well, found that there was... something there. Right?\n\nUm, I don't think that's the issue. On platforms like Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much open to the public. You need to understand that anyone can see what you share, especially if you're friends with someone. You're essentially giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nThat being said, I understand that it's tricky. You can't have one person constantly monitoring everyone's profiles, right? But then again, if there's a genuine concern about someone's safety or behavior, isn't it somewhat reasonable to do so?\n\nI mean, I don't have a Myspace myself, but I have Facebook. It bothers me to know that creepy people out there can see personal information about me. I saw a show once where a guy hacked a girl's profile and found out her screen name and location in less than a minute. It's scary, and I don't want to meet people based on that kind of information. Sometimes my classmates IM me knowing it's me, even if I don't recognize their screen names. It's like they know my interests, where I am, and who my friends are.\n\nI try to limit what I share, but I also use it to connect with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but it's hard to control who can see what you share.\n\nMy roommate told me that in her high school, students were banned from having a Myspace. That seemed a bit off to me. I wasn't sure how school officials could have the power to tell students they couldn't have a Myspace. It's not a privacy issue, more of a power issue. They don't really have the right to tell people what they can and can't do online.",
            "Hmm, well, there's one more thing I need to discuss, the Iraq War. I feel a bit hypocritical talking about it. I guess I'm going to join the crowd that says they were against it from the start. I was, but it's not as important now. The general consensus was that it was a bad idea, except within the administration, who refuse to admit they were wrong.\n\nRecent polls, both in the U.S., Iraq, and globally, show that about 75-80% of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Even 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops there think it was a dumb idea and want us to leave within a year. It's been a complete disaster since we arrived.\n\nI don't know, it's just this culture clash between the U.S. and the Middle East. It's too big a gap for administrations to understand. They think they can impose democracy in an area that won't accept it. Saddam was bad, but the pros and cons should be weighed before invading. It's like quicksand; we're stuck in a mess.\n\nI don't know what to say about it. I don't see a reason to stay. The administration might have hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard a legitimate reason to stay. If they want to leave gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't mind. But why not just leave now?\n\nI read that 80% of Iraqis want us to leave within the year, and a quarter want us to leave now. They're the ones we're trying to help, but they're telling us to leave. Maybe they know better than us. If we ask and they say yes, we won't be responsible if things go wrong afterwards.",
            "While the United States has made strides in gender equality, I believe it's still an issue that's not fully resolved, particularly in specific work environments. For instance, many women face glass ceiling barriers in their professions, struggling to secure promotions due to historical gender biases. Meanwhile, men who stay at home to take care of children often face societal judgment and skepticism about their capabilities. In fields like fashion, men are sometimes not taken seriously due to preconceived notions about their interests and life choices. These instances of gender discrimination are not limited to gender but also extend to other aspects such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing, which can affect how one is perceived in a professional setting. Efforts to address these issues are ongoing, with women climbing higher ranks and men increasingly embracing stay-at-home roles, though societal acceptance is a gradual process. Ultimately, promoting understanding and acceptance through positive representations of these groups is key, without being too forceful, as societal change takes time.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it. This downgraded it from a serious criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested. For instance, if someone gets caught with it, they might face ramifications similar to those of a drug charge, potentially affecting job interviews and other aspects of life. While decriminalization doesn’t erase all future ramifications, it does reduce the cost of enforcement. Arresting, booking, and housing offenders, as well as court proceedings and appointing public defenders, place a significant financial burden on municipalities. Financially strained communities may thus hesitate to decriminalize, even if it could save them money. However, in places like Denver, where attitudes towards marijuana are more open, decriminalization is generally accepted. It frees up resources for public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Still, marijuana isn’t something to be freely available everywhere. While legalizing it could make it as accessible as cigarettes, it might lead to widespread public smoking and driving under the influence. Additionally, many people still view marijuana use as taboo. Moreover, while alcohol has more immediate effects on motor skills, marijuana can have broader impacts on lifestyle. Both substances have their unique adverse effects, and individual reactions vary greatly. Some people can handle substances with moderation while others may not.",
            "I'd respond with a cautious \"yes,\" as I see the value in their traditional practices while also recognizing the need for adaptability to change. Many of their customs are deeply rooted, having been maintained for a long time. This adherence to tradition is a strength, but it's also crucial to embrace change where necessary. For instance, some Catholics are quite rigid about attending church weekly and maintaining strict adherence to their teachings. This can sometimes appear judgmental towards those who don't strictly follow the doctrine or belong to other religions. For example, my parents faced challenges when they tried to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's Episcopalian faith. This isn't reflective of the spirit of loving others, which is a core Catholic teaching, but rather a contradiction of it. I feel that a lot of Catholic doctrine encourages certain actions, yet their practices often contradict these teachings, especially when they refuse to update outdated methods. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior, as child molestation is not the same as a marital relationship. I think these issues would persist regardless of marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, so I can't say whether one side is right or wrong. But I do believe it's the most complex issue we're facing today, due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure how to reconcile these things, but I think civil unions should be the default for all marriages, as they are essentially the same thing: two people united. If states can come to a logical conclusion on this, they should push for federal recognition, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage just seems ridiculous. It's not important enough to amend the constitution over.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends and, while I don’t agree with their lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue; each state should decide for itself. Many states are Democratic and many are Republican. Obviously, Democratic states will push for gay marriage, and if you live in one, you know how the state feels about it. I don’t think you should disagree with the decision if a state legalizes it, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on each state's discretion. Well, I've already touched on that. But, I don’t think Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I believe it should be up to the individual states to decide. I don’t agree with his ban on it. I don’t think Bush lives in every state, so he shouldn’t decide how each state wants to run itself. Some things should be left up to individual states, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision, not the president.",
            "Um, no, I don't agree at all. Um, let me see here. I think that Myspace is a public platform, and that means if you post something, it's meant for the public to see. Whether it be school officials or anyone else. I mean, if they see something on there that could potentially lead to a school shooting, or any other serious issue, they have every right to see it. It's not an invasion of privacy because it's publicly accessible. However, if they're just snooping around to catch students in trouble, that's an invasion of privacy. But if it's for the safety and security of the students, I think that's perfectly fine. Like, if they're looking to make the school a safer place, then I don't see a problem with that. I mean, it's not like they're doing it just to catch students. They're doing it to ensure the safety of everyone. Yeah, that's about it",
            "Initially, I was fully supportive of going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much chaos as they did here. However, I now believe we overlooked long-term consequences and rushed in unprepared. The war backfired, and I'm now strongly opposed to it. The people there, consumed by their own conflicts, can't engage with us meaningfully. They're more focused on driving us out than improving their country. War is different for them; it's more savage, and I don't think they're interested in bettering their situation. We were mostly driven by anger and a desire for revenge, with President Bush leading the charge due to public sentiment. While declaring war on Iraq was necessary, we lacked a clear plan. There was no unity, and our goals were unclear. I don't think we're the ones to change them; they'll always be that way. I believe our involvement is causing more harm than good. The progress we've made is insufficient to justify our prolonged presence. It's a losing battle that we can't maintain forever. We're just hurting ourselves by staying."
